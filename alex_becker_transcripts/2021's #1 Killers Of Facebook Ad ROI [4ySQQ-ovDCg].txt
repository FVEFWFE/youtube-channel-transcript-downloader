================================================================================

this video is going to cover why your facebook ads stop working and why they stop scaling and why when you always get to a certain point or after a certain amount of time they suddenly get more expensive or you suddenly can't scale any further look at highrose i see all the data coming in through all sorts of businesses through their ads and whatnot well i will never share any of that i can show you most of the time why ads are not growing more importantly i can identify from my own experience of growing multiple businesses past eight figures with ads working with businesses doing that there's usually about four things that happen that are the reason why ad stops scaling and it has nothing to do with the ad targeting it has nothing to do with the ad copy it has nothing to do even with the funnel has an understanding of how the ads are working with the audiences on facebook and if you understand this well this is how you take your ads from struggling the past two thousand dollars a day an ad spend to going well past five thousand ten thousand dollars a day this works also on google this works on facebook this works on pinterest ads it doesn't matter it's the same concept across all of them and that's what i'll show you today from my personal experience and from all my experience with working with so many different clients and tracking at house now you're probably wondering alex why are you telling me this why are you giving me all this information it's simple i want you to scale your ads because when you scale your ads up and make more money you're going to need to track it to keep scaling further and when you get to that point you're probably gonna think hmm that ceo at hyrus he helped me out maybe i'll track my ads with hiros because that will help me make a lot more revenue and save a ton of money so i can scale more efficiently that's all so i want you to get to that point so maybe you'll track with us that being said let's hop into it i want to show you these four things because if you can just nail these down this is going to reverse the whole entire rubik's cube puzzle that is facebook ads youtube ads and allow you to scale well infinitely higher okay guys so unlike our other trains which you can also see all over the channel like last week i showed a bunch of different hacks will just immediately increase your facebook ad roi and even on youtube as well a lot of those trainings were in the ad manager we're getting pretty in-depth today is more about an understanding of what's going on with targeting see what most people do when they're trying to scale their ads is they think the secret to why their ads are not making money is the targeting and this is just the furthest thing from the truth targeting is the easy part of ads if you are your ads are not working it's not because you're not using targeting right it's because you're not understanding how the targeting works and what you should be selling to specific targetings and at scale how you should be selling to large groups of people or smaller groups of people or certain markets it's a complete misunderstanding of market size and what the market should be being sold that's usually why people's ads die for example inside of my youtube and facebook ad consulting program iron i'm constantly sharing all my split tests my exact targeting my funnels everything has been working for my business and i'm not trying to push this to you here what i'm trying to tell you is that when i see people come in the program and triple forex their businesses 5x their businesses and again this is people that are actual business owners they're actually running ads these are not beginners coming in and blowing up a business i want to be very clear there but when people come in there it's almost never targeting i give people my exact targeting which isn't that complicated and their business takes off and grows not because of the ad target it grows because they position the right offer to the right market and the right broadness of targeting so targeting is never going to be your solution that is something that ad gurus are going to tell you because they want you to think it's some complicated solution you'll never understand it's never the targeting i spent i've scaled my ads to 25 000 a day on youtube i've skilled fifteen thousand dollars a day on facebook and it's been done using the most simplest targeting look-alike audiences on facebook the word money the word money on youtube worked exceptionally well for me at chimpanzee can do that level of targeting what a chimpanzee cannot do is what i'm about to show you right here see whenever you're selling to a marketplace there's four different levels in the marketplace especially when it comes to bdb which is what most people watching this channel sell but this applies ecommerce supplies anything so let's imagine this marketplace right here is 10 000 people and we're selling real estate coaching we're showing people how to make money in real estate just an easy niche for me to explain it in i actively don't do this niche or anything like that but it's the same across every niche out there so you have to understand that the first layer of this audience is a very very small layer of people that are actually making money and are actively participating in real estate and making anywhere from 50 to anywhere actually any amount of money in real estate okay out of all the people inside this entire marketplace there's probably about 200 of these people and this 10 000. next the next layer of people is people that actively want to start doing real estate they might be making a little bit of money but not fifty thousand or just sort of getting into and they they've chosen like i want to do real estate i want to do some real estate marketing this would only be maybe another 500 people and so if we're looking at the true b2b potential of this marketplace right here it's extremely small and i'll get into why this is important here in a second but if we look at the rest of the marketplace the next audience size right here is people that just want to start a business they're committed to actually going and becoming entrepreneurs and making their own business and so this might be another 2 000 people in the marketplace and in the final rest of the marketplace right here the about i don't know 7 000 rest of them are people that just simply want more money these are people who want more money and so what happens here's where most people get crushed and this applies to any business that's out there if you don't get this gap this is why you get messed up is people try and take this offer right and sell it to these people right here when you're trying to scale up and go broad you're going to quickly get into this area because if you're spending ten thousand bucks a day there is not enough people who are actively making money in real estate for ten thousand dollars a day an ad spend to be deployed it's just not you're going to have to separate across many different platforms and many different different promotional methods and so this doesn't work right here and this is why most people ads die because they go and take this off right here they position it pretty cheaply like one thousand to two thousand dollars and then they try and scale it and sell it to a mass market that doesn't work or what they try and do is they try and take a mass market product about making more money in real estate in general and sell it to a person that is already making substantial money in real estate they don't want to buy that they want to buy the next thing up and so what happens is people either try and take a 1 000 to 2 000 offer that's designed for this marketplace and bring it to these people well there's not enough people in this marketplace right here to support that if i sold you would run out of all 200 of these people very quickly the same thing happens on facebook and youtube ads on the flip side you can't take this offer right here which is ten thousand dollars and sell to this marketplace right here and on the flip side this offer right here which would be if we were making an offer specifically for these people would be how to grow your real estate business that you're already making money in won't work in this marketplace right here and this is where most people's ads die because they try and take this offer this marketplace this marketplace to this marketplace it doesn't work like that you need to say who am i targeting am i targeting b2b which is people that are actively involved in something or am i targeting people with more base needs am i targeting the mass market and you need to understand that that's who you're selling to and you're not selling anybody else this is the number one reason why ads die because what happens when you first start up your ads your ads are very micro targeted and this works great if you're in b2b where there's a micro audience for example people that actually actively own a dental office but the problem is with micro targeting there's not enough traffic to actively support massive skill so you have to sell very expensive offers an offer that's five thousand ten thousand twenty five thousand dollars because then you can scale that you either have to have a really deep backend or a very expensive offer this is where most people make a lot of money doing this because if you understand the audience is small you can stick to micro targeting and you don't have to scale very far to make a lot of money as soon as you start scaling out on facebook as soon as you start getting past a thousand two thousand dollars per day you start branching off into a very broad audience of people these are people with very base simple needs and you need to understand that a lot of people will try and take a middle ground offer that plays to both audiences at the same time and scale that and it won't work because the middle ground offer is not expensive enough to be supported by the micro audiences but it's also not positioned well enough to work with the base audiences for example the base audiences don't want a real estate course they want a way to make money quickly without effort and this applies to anything weight loss home improvement whatever okay you get from people that just want a push button solution you need to be convinced to get started on a path whereas you have people that are already far down the path you need to sell them completely different things at completely different price points and so what happens right here is when people go and they usually start with their base offers or base offers they sell a 1 000 to 2 000 offer that works at these micro audiences but won't scale because they can't make enough money at the micro audiences and so they try and scale it large they try and scale it to a mass audience and it doesn't work because the mass audience doesn't want to buy that and then the the micro audience also doesn't want to buy it either so they end up in this weird limbo where their ads don't make an roi and so that's the first thing you need to understand who am i going to sell to and what is my scale going to look like for example at harvest our ads are extremely profitable but we're not scaled very far because we target ad runners that's a very small audience sometimes the audience and marketplace you're selling to isn't that large and so you need to focus on instead making exxon offers that you can charge extremely high prices for and so that's the biggest mistake i see number one but the next thing i also see is not understanding how other your competitors back ends work so with a lot of times with your ads let's say you're running a funnel that requires you to pay ten dollars for a person to come in well as you scale up the increase or the the because of the broadness of your targeting the amount you're gonna have to pay is going to increase you're gonna get from ten dollars to fifteen dollars to 20 eventually that's gonna become too much for you and the reason why is because the person that's making this get up to twenty dollars like somebody's willing to pay that amount for the lead is probably one of your competitors as a super deep back-end so for example the time in my consulting group iron what i'll see all the time is i'm going to see people they start seeing their cpl going up they're cost to get a lead in and then they just can't do it anymore and they're like how do i how do i make this work and their funnel and everything is optimized they've copied everything i've done we've shared we've gone into everything they're doing it's just not going to happen so the way that they actually make this work is you need to go and say okay cool i got a i got a 2 000 off right here we need to have a deeper backend because for example if you look at any of the largest businesses in any space you look at the real estate coaching space you look at the e-commerce space you look in weight loss pace doesn't matter the largest businesses usually don't make money on their front end they usually lose money getting a customer in the door for example i was looking at a huge self-help guru and he spends about three months of what a customer spends to get him in the door so that means if a customer on average when they opt in spends 30 dollars with them over three months that's how much he spends so he loses 30 up front so what you need to understand is that when you're doing this the number one way to make sure your ads actually scale further is you need to find a way to make it so that if you are getting a lead in and you used to be able to only pay ten dollars per lead you need to make it so you can pay thirty dollars per lead that's how you scale you don't focus on the targeting and i know this chicken scratch looks nice but don't focus on the targeting you can only do so well with the targeting and once you understand that concept i showed you before your targeting is going to be pretty simple and good to go what you want to do is you need to make sure that you can afford to pay more per lead and that's by getting people to spend more over a month two months five months 10 months and the only way you can do that is you actively have to track it which just allows me to segment into the next thing you need to know just straight up if i go look at some of our high-risk tracking results right here and i look at last click you're going to consistently see when you just use ad manager tracking you're not going to get the accurate data that's coming in you need to be using print tracking there's just not enough points of there's not enough touch points for them to actively track anything to the point you need to once you're at scale you can see right here for example we only had seven calls well reported 11 calls and there was actually no sales from this and you can see right here i reported one call when there was actually two calls and there's actually a mass amount of profit from this and so i'm going to scale around these things you can even see right here reports six calls when there's three report eight calls when there is five and i can go into my back end and hirose and i can look at the sources for every single one of my calls none of my calls are not getting attributed okay and this is chronic when you have multiple traffic sources chronic when you have organic traffic this is chronic when you're doing social media every single one of my calls right here is being attributed there's not some bogus calls that are being tracked by facebook and then not being tracked by us we literally have the exact county call sheet plugged into here and so you need to know the true source of where your calls are coming from you know the true source where your leads are coming from and you you need to know and you need to know the true source of where your sales are coming from this applies to e-commerce webinars and whatnot and again i'm just showing you very quickly over my shoulder and my job is not to push harus on you in this video but when you're operating off of incorrect data you're operating off of incorrect data and that's not too bad when you're at a hundred bucks a day scale when you're at five thousand ten thousand bucks a day scale that thirty percent five 25 40 you're off by that starts to really kill your ads because your ad budgets and profits gets much tighter at scale and the way you scale is by having those 30 to 50 margins especially at scale for example if i'm spending 10k a day and i have 30 waste on my account and that results in me only making 10k a day back i can't scale if i fix this 30 50 of waste and i'm making 13k a day back off of 10k suddenly i can scale so i can scale quite easily and as you go and start buying and scaling up your ads that waste right there is going to come and bite you because your profit margin goes down as you scale always and so you need to keep that profit margin as high as you possibly can for for as long as you possibly can and then again the other thing i was talking about you need to know the ltv you need to know the back end for your customers so for example this one funnel right here cost me about 150 200 bucks to get a phone call and that's been gradually going up for a long time now but i know if i track everything my customers buy over a period of time back to the original ads that i'm making 749 for every single person that books a call with us so i'm just fine paying 200 per phone call almost 3.5 xing my money cash every single time just for this one simple funnel that's how you scale your ads because if i was looking at the upfront value by week one or week two my ltv is 187 bucks and that's really what the ad managers are going to be able to catch they're not going to track this far out they're just not there's too many phone switches there's too many device switches there's too many ip switches there's too many cookie clearings it's not going to happen and so my business would be dead in the water if i was going up these numbers so track your stuff okay trying to scale with 30 50 waist in the account and then not knowing your ltv it's just making it so you're playing a massive disadvantage because every other big business is doing this when they're scaling and this example right here i'm just using hiros i don't know how else you could do this but whatever way you decide to do it even if you don't want to use hiros like figure out some way to do it because it's incredibly important for scaling finally you have to understand this thing as well when you first launch an offer you're going to have this marketplace and there's going to be a segment of the marketplace it's just hungry it's not huge but maybe 25 the marketplace just really wants to buy what you're selling because of this when you first start up ads it's going to be artificially high your roi is going to be higher than it will normally be over time and what's going to happen as you go deeper and deeper into this marketplace is you're going to start burning through people who have different layers of interest and eventually you're getting into this big void right here of people that really need to be sold to and convinced and so what's gonna happen is when you first kick up your ads even if you get to a thousand two thousand dollars a day sale scale you're going to see okay cool i spend a thousand dollars a day i make 5k back and then after three months you're going to say whoa oh i spend a thousand dollars a day and i only make 3k back then i spend 1k a day and i only make 1.5 k back what's happening is the offer dead no what's happening is you sold out to all the people that are super interested and you're going to have to consistently improve your copy you're going to have to increase consistently improve the opt-in rates in every little aspect of your funnel and that's just normal and so what you need to be thinking about when you have your ads is expect the roi to always be falling and we need to be constantly looking at how can i improve the offer to convert higher how can i improve the copy to be more convincing what am i not understanding about the customers how can i increase the opt-in rate of our webinar of our sales call funnel of our e-commerce business how can i go and improve and improve this by another five percent because you need to understand that when you're at 5k day what most people do is they sit back on their loins and just chill out for example when i was scaling an offer to a million dollars per month i got it to 300 000 a month very quickly and then it started breaking even then i went and improved it more and got it to a million a month in sales then it did the same exact thing then it went backwards again and either going to improve the offer again and if i had just been this entire time just knowing that it was going to collapse i could have really countered this off and stopped my ads from going into a place where the roi got unacceptable and so that's the last tip i wanted to give you right there and that is why people's facebook and youtube ads die that is why they died they're selling to the wrong market segment like i showed you before they're trying to sell a b2b offer to a mass market or they're trying to sell a mass market to a b2b audience they're pricing the product wrong for the audiences they're trying to sell a cheap product to a small audience never works they're trying to sell a super expensive product to a mass audience they're not positioning right that's the number one reason why people's ads fall apart next people aren't tracking their ltv or more importantly they just aren't tracking even their upfront numbers okay i've seen so many people webinars i've seen my webinar where if i go and track them in hiros then we're only catching 30 40 of sales that results in so much waste in the account and then finally people are again always looking at their targeting instead of looking at long-term optimization of the funnel which is something that's just always going to need to happen and hopefully it's way more optimized than my chicken scratch test so this is exactly what you should be looking at now guys like always in this video i was showing you inside my hi-ris account if you actually just want to track your ads get a demo want us to analyze your account and show you where all your waste is at schedule a call with us below we'll go through we'll look at what you're doing with your ads we'll look at how your tracking can be improved we'll look at how much money you can save and we'll just show you how much money you can save if there is potential for it to be saved if there isn't potential for you to scale more with tracking there isn't potential for you to save a ton of money we'll just tell you that okay because at highrose when people come to high roast there's a 90 day refund guarantee so if people don't see dramatic tracking results and all the things i talked about in this video they don't pay so we're just straight up with you there on top of that if you're interested in getting more info on that funnel and ad consulting mastermind i talked about there's a link below as well you can go on there i'll hop on a call with you we'll talk about how you can improve your ads what you're doing and again we'll just be straight and say oh

to do if you're watching this video because you're interested in ads join the hi-ros facebook group just just go to facebook type in hirose should be one of the first things that shows up the high official hirose forum there is a qualification process you need to be spending some significant ad spend in there however we have over 50 million a month in ads spent in there if you put all of our
