================================================================================

all right so Facebook audiences that absolutely money audiences that are so good you don't even have to be good at advertising you just copy paste these audiences in and oh chef's kiss you're printing money like crazy that's that's why you're here right and if you're like pretty much everyone else online you have this fascination with finding the ultimate audience that nobody else on Facebook knows about that just allows you to get sales on complete autopilot and it works 10 times better than every audience what's the secret magic sauce I'm going to give it to you in this video and when I say I'm going to give it to you in this video I can actually deliver because I have one little Advantage see I'm the CEO of hyos that means we track billions and billions of dollars worth of Facebook ads and so what I'm going to give you in this video is not just for my personal experience of spending tens of millions of dollars and generating literally hundreds of millions of dollars in results from Facebook ads and Google ads but what I'm also going to be giving you in this video is what I'm seeing working across the entire industry over and over and over again across thousands of businesses and again billions of dollars worth of Facebook ads spent these audiences right here and this strategy I'm going to give you for audiences is going to give you the most optimal targeting now you need to be using the right ad strategies the right funnels and selling the right things that's why there's all sorts of other videos on this channel that show you exactly what's working on Facebook ads right now and really actually working everywhere and another bonus is what I'm going to show you right here also is working best theory wise on Google so you can kind of take this mythology I'm going to show you right here copy it to Google get similar results and on top of that below this video I've linked to the best ad scripts that I'm using for this again these are just on YouTube I'm not selling anything on these channels and on top of this below this video I linked to a video with my exact ad scripts on Facebook that just plain straight up work these are what's working best for me right now I can't beat the conversion rates of these videos and again that's just going to be linked below this video when you get done here because that's essential to making these audiences work and like always this is all for free on YouTube I'm just giving literally everything away I'm not selling you a course or anything like that so without further Ado let's hop into these audiences so what I want to do is walk you through the audiences that I'm using however I run a very kind of specific funnel for SAS that focuses on very high ticket call funnel based sales you probably might be doing something in e-commerce or selling courses and so I want to explain to you the theory behind this so you can apply it to your businesses because this works stupidly well in e-commerce it works stupidly well in smaller core sales and I've used this to sell tens of millions of dollars worth of info procs and I've seen this working across businesses that are doing over $100 million you're in e-commerce and it's really more about how you think about people are interacting with your ads because when you look at Facebook ads in general the audiences have gotten more and more limited for example you used to be able to Target everything down to like what they liked there was way more audiences that Facebook was always updating now it almost does all the targeting for you so you really have to understand how people are interacting with the ads and how to funnel them to audience funnels now we're going to be having my ad account and just one General tip you should be using hyro for this everyone's going to roll their eyes and say oh Alex is talking about hrus again on this channel but I don't see how you're actually going to run ads efficiently you can see it here in hyos with the tracking that I'm doing I'm tracking calls in this example right here and you can see that Facebook in this example caught 84 calls hyros CAU 247 the tracking accuracy of Facebook just isn't there cuz Google and apple are constantly blocking their ad tracking they're constantly messing with how their conversion tracking works and it doesn't plug into your business at the depths that should to accurately track and so you're just not tracking all your sales and you're making wildly inaccurate ad calls off of data that just isn't accurate on top of that you should be feeding these metrics back to Facebook to optimize your targeting That's essential for these audiences because what I'm able to do is instead of using this right here these 84 calls I'm using the 247 calls right here and this is really bad if I'm using these 84 calls because it marks the 160 or so people that are actual calls or customers as non- leads as non- buyers as as emitting it from the data list which is bad because then it doesn't optimize to Target those people so please use hrus tracking or use some type of tracking out there which again you're not going to be able to do all the same stuff that hrus is doing with other tracking but please just use tracking it's essential for making these audiences work you can't pick audiences you can't pick what's working if you're not tracking all your sales and data you're just guessing it's like trying to pick the winner of a beauty contest when you can only see I don't know their feet or something and for some guys that might actually worked just fine wink wink okay let's not the grade degenerate humor on this channel but you get what I'm saying so what I want to show you is when it comes to audiences on Facebook you can really do a lot of damage with just basic audiences you can see for example in this ad right here and this is where you really want to start off at is I'm just targeting people that like Shopify okay so I'm just using basic targeting which is what you want to be using to start off your ads and you can see that I'm just doing Shopify so the first place you're going to want to start is just the obvious places that make sense when you're starting up your ad campaigns go find all the things that make sense if I put in Shopify right here and click suggestions it's going to give me a lot of suggestions I like using similar software similar influencers in the niche similar websites and Brands you can also go super wide with the big basic General audiences you can see right here I'm just doing advertising and marketing but what I'm going to start off with and where I like to begin ads add especially with these big giant audiences is I like to mix them together to make a mixed audience right here it's a very basic technique but if you're targeting an audience of 547 million people you want to layer it and so if you're really looking to get the most of your ad budget you could layer it multiple times so what we' want to do is it would click to find further and I can make this even better by coming down here and layering it okay so I could do everybody that's in advertising and marketing and also likes garyb uh and like and or like Shopify and or like Salesforce so find software and similar influencers as base audiences and then layer those with the big General audiences or you can just triple layer the big audiences on top of each other so for example we could do like seo seo and online marketing so we could layer these together with this and so that's going to give you your best base audiences and you can get a lot of damage done with these now I'm going to give you a little few extra tips we'll get into like the actual ads you should run in other videos but what you want to use on these ads is just pure coldhearted direct response ads So Below in this video is my actual script for cold response ads these are ads where you just go straight for the jugular and try to get them to come on and book a call or book a sale now if you're like a lot of other businesses this is probably not where you're going to make most of your profit at but the goal here is just to break even on these ads or if you're good you can make money on them I make money on our ads because I have a very specific High ticket funnel that prints money with Facebook and now again that strategy will be linked to the end of this video it's also Below in the description of this video but you really shouldn't be aiming to make a lot of money with your first touch ads so I want to explain this to you so you know how to start off because this is where it actually starts getting impactful because what we want to do is we have these first ads that come from Big audiences and what we want to do is we want to start building retargeting list based on this traffic and based on its Behavior now little bonus is if you already have people coming to your site you already have an existing brand you want to move to look like audiences you want to move to behavioral based lookalike audiences more importantly as fast as possible so if we're just using these audiences right here what I'm going to do is I want to retarget everybody that comes to the website okay so this going to be everybody that clicks that and comes to the website and what I'm going to hit them with is brand style ads and a mix of the cold response ads or the cold direct response ads that we used before so the ads we're using here we're going to bring down here here as well we're also going to run brand ads that are better for establishing Rapport because what you have to have in advertising right now to long-term make it work and print a lot of money is you want people to know who you are because you have to understand most people don't buy from ads if you can think back to your buying history for example I bought shoes yesterday online I didn't click ads for shoes I don't get any of the clothes I don't get a lot of software I didn't get anything that I actually buy from ads now you're likely the same I've never very rarely have bought something from a d my entire life 90% of what I buy online comes from researching or digging around are brands that keyword I'm aware of so what does brands that you're aware of mean it means ads and content that you digest passively so have you ever seen like a Geico commercial if I say hey name an insurance company you're probably going to say Geico if I say name an athletic company you're going to name brands that fit in your brain the same way that Geico does if I say name a Tracking Company I want for example people to think of hyros because they're saying these brand ads everywhere okay so I know that the people I'm targeting right here specifically the people clicking this ad for tracking in my examples but any type of business model out there there really aren't that many of them in terms of buyers and people actually buying these things so I want my my brand to be on their mind at all times and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to build an audience off of a few different things and we're going to do the same thing with our standard site tracking so when people click my ad what I'm going to do is I want to retarget everybody to click the ad and I'm going to create an audience based on that so that we're just going to do basic visitors but next I want to look at their actions okay so on your pages for example on our Pages there's a link to get a demo okay or on your pages if it's e-commerce on your pages if it's an info page there's Pages where they get more info or move down the funnel a little bit and so this is very important on our website hyros you can see there's a book Now demo so people go to this page right here now I'm going to start targeting and really focusing on building local like audiences off of people that get to this page right here because this shows interest in what we're doing a lot of people just click here click away might not be the best audience so what I want to do is everybody that clicks a button that shows interest so intent now of course we want to retarget all these people retargeting lists are easy you probably already know about that what we want to do is we want to create local likes off of this and then we create more look likes as we get deeper down the funnel so what I'm next I'm going to do is people that booked a call so everybody came to our thank you page and then finally a loal like audience off our customers these four audiences right here are going to give you the most oomph and you not primarily want to disregard these big broad audiences but you want to get down to this as much as possible because this is where you start getting the edge at and so we have visitors intent action takers and then customers now you should already have these lists in your business if you've been running your business for a long time but this is where you really want to focus on Facebook and really just stop if you can't make these audio audiences convert you're doing something wrong then what you do with these audiences and you're going to see them perform on different levels so for example your customer lookalike audience is probably going to perform the best and this means you can actually expand the lookalike audience to two to 3% audiences or if you're an e-commerce or something that goes really broad you can go much further so what I'm going to do on these audiences is if I see the customer audience at a lookalike of 1% working I'm going to make a 2% if the 2% works I'm make a 3% and you're going to see the results start to theg grade as you make it bigger and bigger and bigger for example in the tracking industry and AD tracking industry you're watching this right now if you look at the views on these videos or other views on ad channels there's really not that many of us the amount of people that spend over 20,000 50,000 a month on Advertising it's it's probably 100,000 200,000 people tops that's a lot of people but you can reach that entire audience base or I can reach the entire audience base of AD Runners on Facebook and you know with a couple thousand worth of AD spend I can reach every single one of those people you can see here the reach if we just go on yesterday and we spent $65 right here you know we only spent 200 bucks and we're able to reach about 2,000 people if I'm doing that in advertising it doesn't take me very long to make sure that everybody in advertising sees this this is a very small campaign right here so it depends on your niche in advertising I'm really going to cap out at the two 1% audiences now if you're in e-commerce it's going to go a lot larger now you just follow that process with all these if you see an audience working just expand it and what I'm going to do with these audiences is usually increase the ad spend by about 20% per day until I start seeing limited Returns on it or the the cost per customer starts to fall apart again if you're not tracking accurately you're not going to see when it starts to fall apart if I'm looking at my ad results right here in Facebook and going off of what it's telling me it's telling me me that my ads are falling apart like day one where as I look at the actual results it's wildly different okay I need to be operating off this number right here and optimizing my look likes and everything off this number if I'm optimizing off of this by default my my ads are falling apart the same applies to you even if you're your tracking looks good on Facebook there's so many more sales you're not tracking and optimizing for that could allow you to optimize 10 times better so again use tracking and so with these audiences right here I'm going to continue to use the cold direct response ads these are ads assuming a person's never seen my brand and I'm just going straight for the kill there's a lot of people that also want rareness ads first so people will put a video upfront of their brand just something giving content or value and then they'll start to retarget People based on watching that video that works very well in e-commerce so just keep that in mind you're going to run all these ads and everybody that views the ad or clicks the ad then you retarget them with a go for the kill hey buy my stuff kind of thing in tracking in my industry I just like to go cold upfront CU there isn't as much noise if you're selling something like a nutritional product there is thousands of different nutritional products out there hyros for example only competes with my opinion two to three other companies so I don't have to get past so much noise in other models you do if you're running like a let's say a pre-workout there are 6,000 other pre-workouts being ran to these customers you're going to need to build some brand Report with them so at this point what I'm do is that I'm going to build retargeting list off of people that visited the site people that have intent and not so much the thank you pages and buyers so I'm going to run retarding ads that have brand appeal to these audiences right here on top of hitting them with the cold ads cuz what I want them to do is I want them to start getting to know my brand over time maybe it's going to take 5 10 ads for them to actually become customers for example if I look at this this customer in a call that came in um yesterday you can see that they clicked an ad days ago and it took multiple ads for them to come in and actually become a customer with hyos you know they they had to actually go and click one ad and they had to click a retargeting ad and they went through all sorts of other stuff going on here so you're going to see I'm looking at ones that are like really crazy you're going to see there's there's people that have to click multiple ads this person had to click four ads before they came a customer so we constantly want to be building that rapport with them so that when they are ready to convert and they get hit with that cold ad that cold ad's going to do the damage that we need because of the Rapport we've built with them over time and I'll get into brand ads later on in this channel I would really Master this cold ad especially if your business is under the $50 million in sales Mark which I know seems like a lot but when you scale that actually comes pretty quickly because you can get to that $50 million in initial sales with cold ads all loan once you get to that $50 million worth of sales and a lot of Industries you've kind of started to run out of people that actually buy from ads and you need to start actually building a brand and they attracting on the people that don't buy from ads because a lot of people are going to see these brand ads for example and then they're just going to look up your website in their own time and then come back and buy which you need to be able to attribute as well again use hyros that's the type of audiences that I'm using IF as you can see a lot of people break down their audiences these big crazy scientific U multi- lawyered by AG group kind of thing you can let Facebook do most of the work for you in these instances the most important thing is how you build your retargeting lookalike list and you're going to have these core lookalike lists on your site you need to be retargeting and creating lookalike looks list of your visitors you need to be doing the intent so for example in e-commerce intent could be people that get to the cart page or do an ad the cart or view more than four pages in the site and of course making lookalike list of your buyers and customers that's going to give you these are probably going to be your best cold response audiences but you need to be able to Branch out of those so that in a nutshell is the big broad overview of what's working on Facebook right now I'm going to make some more videos showing you really specific like micro sniper strategies and specific audience tactics in the next few videos so be sure to subscribe and in the meantime why you just look at the scripts and the funnels that I'm using so you can actually see how we're monetizing these and making them profitable because the best audiences on Earth are not going to work unless you know how to convert them and script the ads in a way to get people to click and actually do what you want them to do so that being said this is the video I don't have anything else to add I'll catch you in the next one
