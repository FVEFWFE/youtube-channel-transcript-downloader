what is up guys this is alex becker CEO of market hero do you guys like my cool title i have to say to every at the start of every videos you know i'm a really important guy but beyond this this video is important because i'm gonna show you the key to generating five thousand eight thousand ten thousand dollars a day on facebook ads I'm gonna take you inside of the account where we spend about two to three thousand dollars a day and make about five six eight some days on a really good day ten K back and the thing I want to stress on this video and the reason why I'm making this video is when a lot of people out market here I'll have huge interest in Facebook ads and with our new Facebook sinking feature that sinks your email list up with all your retargeting lists and everything on Facebook automatically I want to talk about this little bit a bit more so I see everybody who's trying to do this they over complicate and they miss how Facebook Ads are supposed to work Facebook ads are designed to do most of the heavy lifting in the targeting for you once you give Facebook a little bit of data and so what I'm gonna show you right here is this ad account where I'm spending two to three thousand dollars a day but what you're gonna see is so shockingly different than a lot of people's ad accounts you make far less a day from Facebook than we do and I want to stress that Facebook is one of many ad platforms we use it only represents about twenty percent of our traffic that being said a lot of people are making far less than us have extremely complicated Facebook ads set ups their their keyword I'm gonna use the word keyword an interest and unchangeably because I work more most an hours but the target they do is is so all over the place so finely tuned and you really don't want to do that what you want to do is give Facebook a little bit of data and then give them a big ass net and then that's going to allow you to go out there and get tremendous results so what you're gonna see in this ad account is it's almost it's only five or six ad sets we're the very basic targeting and I'm gonna show you the target behind that and how I use that targeting to get leads at a huge discount very cheap leads and you need to understand Facebook's scaling limits and everything that i'ma break down this video but more importantly I mentally go out there and spend two three thousand dollars a day get hundreds and hundreds of leads in and make a five six eight sometimes 10k day return and that's why I may be breaking down this video that's what I'm gonna be doing and if you really like this video you should be sure to open more of our emails and you should definitely buy market hero go check out the free trial it's amazing below so let's get into this content all right boys and girls we are now inside my computer it's a very cool place there are there's free drinks there's chimpanzees juggling fire and there's even cookie so you're watching this from a video so you can't see all this so just just take my word on it so oh I know you're really excited about the cookies now I didn't mean to distract you but what we're gonna get into right now that is worth your attention because I'm gonna be showing you really the nuances of Facebook advertising and like I talked about in the intro and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna try and repeat myself too much here but a lot of Facebook advertising can be done without targeting a single key word slash interest okay and we use the word key word an interest interchangeably because you need to understand that 80 percent of my traffic comes from Adwords and other platforms Facebook is just one of many things I use but I want to show you since this is what most people get started on and the thing I want to point out first is we're inside this ad account right here and you can see this ad account easily is spending about two thousand dollars a day and I want to break down one thing not none of my interest is or and none of my groups right here the only one is really targeting keywords is this bad boy right here and this isn't even like our major one you can see I really didn't run too much going on right here and so if we actually go and like look at this campaign sir this one right here is targeting just basic basic interest basic keywords and stuff like that but what you're gonna see in a lot of my other groups is it's literally not even just carbon copied a similar audience so if you actually go and look at this audience right here and this is where I'm really be talking about the day's similar audiences and retargeting because this is where the real magic is at because you can see what I'm doing is is this is just a look-alike audience and you can see I'm getting tons of registrations at a great Cpl right here and that's it and so what I'm gonna break down here isn't super advanced Facebook advertising because honestly this account right here a two thousand bucks a day usually makes me about six to eight thousand dollars a day back so that that's great that's great by most people's standards and I want to distress it you don't really need to be doing anything crazy to get to eight to 10 K a day earned on Facebook ads you don't have to be doing something crazy or finding some loophole you can just literally use similar audiences and stacked targeting so that's what I want to get into so before we do this though I to break down kind of a revolution and how I viewed ads and really think that makes a little difference so you're viewing this on the market your website right now so I'm assuming that you have an email list so there you have three types of audiences that I'm just gonna listen this video that you can reach and make a significant ROI on and just immediately and blow up your business all right so you have your email list which you can reach for free you have your visitors that come to your website and then you have these people via retargeting so what does this mean the two people that are going to be most likely to buy something from you and the easiest to engage with are going to be people that are on your email list or people that visit your website the end but the thing is if we want to reach people on our email list we can only do so often do it so often with emails you need to understand that that's the one downfall of emails if I send my email lists the same exact after every single day for 30 days it's gonna lead to massive disengagement the same exact thing and problem with visitors is you really only have one shot at them and you can't market to them too much and the thing is most people do not really reuse retargeting for their email lists and their visits the way they should what a lot of people do is they think oh I'm gonna run an ad or something but I want to get new customers and what you need to understand is if you start trading retargeting like an email list where you scratched out the offers you change up the offers you you hit them with something new every single week it's one of the easiest ways to blow up your business now what we can also then do to acquire new customers is we create lists of people that are very similar to our retargeting of our email and visits and then we use various types of interests tacking or just heck the audience to go out there and do that now one thing I also want to stress is the more the more registrations the more conversions that your Facebook pixel records the more powerful it gets so let's imagine you have a pixel in its day one and what you want to do is you want to start targeting people on your email list you want to start targeting your visitors immediately because what's gonna do is it's gonna build up your pixel and kind of give them a screen shot of who your perfect customer is once you have about a thousand the two thousand let's just say conversions people opting onto your email is opting into your your webinars opting into your optin this pixel is gonna be very very very useful it's gonna allow you to go out there and do that kind of stuff so what you want to do first off when we're doing face week I'm gonna break down in the ad account how they actually do these things it's first off you want to upload your email list you want to upload our place retargeting pixel on your website and you want to start running opt-in ads to those customers why do you want to do it so you can follow up with them after they opt-in and do the funnels now here's the cool thing about market here first off every single person that joins your email list is automatically added to your Facebook audiences okay so you can actually very effectively market to people that are on your email is just by syncing it with market here and we have a Facebook sink inside there if you want to go check that out there's a free trial to market here a blow among all the other things it does like tracking your LTV tracking your conversion tracking all the things that you need to actually run Facebook Ads effectively those numbers are pretty much not not up for debate you need to have your LTV and you know how it's your your emails are making you but if we sink this from market hero what's gonna do is it's gonna automatically update the email list for us and then the visits are gonna automatically be updated for us as well and so we want to start running opt-in as to these people and a really good example of a great opt-in that you can run it for is for webinars or for a free book offer or something to get some opt-in then they're sold to after that and these people are gonna be very cheap to get the up in and their conversions gonna be very high so what this allows you to do right here is just add another facet of your business where you're selling if you have an email list of 80,000 people I guarantee you're only really reaching about 40,000 people on that email list just because you know not everybody's gonna be open their emails so the way you reach that other 40,000 is you hit them up on Facebook you hit them up on Adwords so you hit the visitors on your website and more importantly what we want to do is if a person visits your website we want that email we need that email so what you need to do is you need to be hitting them up with an opt-in immediately after they visit your website so you can start building up your email list and what's gonna happen is your pixel is going to start tracking all this and it's gonna allow your pixel to become very hyperactive a very hyper targeted allow you to always you could just literally target just a big broad audience and you can still get conversions at a good rate because the pixel knows who to look for so once we have this in place guys what we want to do is we want to create three types of audiences okay we want to create these basic similar audiences we want to create similar to visit audiences all right so we want to have similar to our email list and similar to visits those are two types of audience and we want to do similar stacked audiences and this right here is more than enough depending on your business to spend up to two thousand three thousand five thousand a day depending on how large your niche is okay I work in a pretty small niche which is internet marketing which you might think is really huge but compared to something like weight loss or skincare or just general niches out there it's it's a little tiny niche so let me show you how we do that so in this video I'm not gonna get into uploading your email list that can actually be automatically synced to be a market hero I'm not gonna get into adding a retargeting pixel to your website I'm not gonna get into creating similar audiences those are all things that can be easily solved just by watching a simple tutorial video and I don't want to waste your time doing that if you need help doing that I've went to some tutorial videos below this video on the block what I want to talk about is simply making the audiences to convert because if you know this right here you're gonna do pretty well so what we want to do is you want to go and when you crane your ad focus on conversions now there's all sorts of creative cool things you can do with all these options but again I'm trying to keep this simple because again it you don't need to be worrying about complicated stuff until you're making 5,000 10,000 bucks a day off your ads that's just that's just how it is you don't need to do complicated stuff to make large amount of monies on Facebook you large modem who knows you just don't need to at least not from what I'm doing and I'm working in a very competitive niche so I'm gonna just do name this you know demo and what we're gonna do for conversions is I'm gonna set the conversion up to our complete registration pixels you can see anybody that opsin triggers his conversion and face we're kind of records who they are what they're doing and everything like that so that's fine great this is what we want the pixel to do so the pixel we already have a first layer of targeting just using this pixel right here now the next thing you want to do is you want to target our similar audiences okay so the first step of audience we want to create is just simply look-alike a to our email list that's it okay we can create an ad just doing this we create the ad we go and pump it out we start with that right away that's one audience right there that we can scale to a lot of money every single day it's over it's over 3.4 million people now one thing you wanted to uncheck is you this depends on you you either want to check or uncheck this so to expand interest this is an easy way to keep it going past the 3.4 million people you can expand it right here on Facebook go find people using your pixel on this layer you need to understand it right here this looks like very little targeting but we have one layer of targeting right here we have another layer of targeting right here and we can even close this off right here I like to keep it expanding because they will go and find new customers and stuff now the next targeting what you want to do that can't scale quite as far as you want to do a 2% look-alike of our email list and visitors okay so we want to create items for both these this is really big and really broad and so the way we double down on this is we want to go in let's say I want to target everybody that let's say i'm i'm in the marking so let's just do anybody that likes MailChimp okay so if I want to find perfect people that are good for my autoresponder anybody that also likes MailChimp so they have to follow the kind of hole in the profile the complete registration they have to look like the look-alike and they also have to like MailChimp now if you really want to narrow this down you're looking at a cheap budget you can super do it so I'm going to say anybody that likes MailChimp and Mike Dillard since he's an authority kind of on email marketing so this layers it down so I have a potential reach of 15,000 people so if I'm looking only to spend about a hundred bucks a day this is an amazing audience right here because it's hyper hyper hyper targeted now the next type of audience and so what we can then do is we're gonna make several of these types of audience so I can do everybody likes MailChimp and likes Frank Kern okay and I can I can create tons of these little audiences and put out 25 to 50 bucks a day into that so that is how you go out there and target that now one thing to understand is I usually don't even go down to that narrow targeting I'll just add a few people in here like alright so they have to look alike my audience and then they have to like like let's just type in Russell Brunson so weird it doesn't show up when we do it all right so they have to like get response Infusionsoft one of these things right here okay so that gives me a big ol list of people to go after and make a 25 $200 a day audience now the thing you want to understand Facebook Ads is the way to really scale it is once you get to a certain point what ads they're not gonna scale anymore for example this audience right here if I if I try and spend $500 a day on the sidings it doesn't scale and what that means is it's kind of like you built an engine they can only go 30 miles per hour and once you try and start making a go 5060 miles per hour it starts to break down you need to be aware of this and so when you're gonna be looking at your ads as these audiences scale and scale you know depending on the size of the people it's gonna stop and you want to create more audiences so if I get to let's just say with this audience right here if I get to $50 a day and the CPL styling is good but if I bump it up to 100 bucks a day in the Cpl goes to crap what I want to do is lower it back down to 50 bucks a day and make another audience it looks like I don't know maybe people that like names are my competitors so I'm gonna type in that's just to you know Frank Kern and we'll just do all sorts of other marketers and stuff that pop up right here so you can I can do you know Tony Robin and these triple layers are dead so I view this the way to scale is you create more audiences and more target you don't try and scale one audience to 5000 bucks a day that's just not how it works it bottoms out eventually now finally the last tip I want to give you is you want to have a retargeting pixel on your opt-in page and so what you want to do is you got to understand the goal of when you're running ads is to get people in this cheap please possum the people are gonna be able to get in and cheaply as possible people that have already clicked your ad and showed interest and so what you can do is you can also create an audience that targets people that abuse your opt-in and what you want to do is we target them with another ad saying hey look I know I saw you clicked on this I know you're interested but you didn't opt-in so let me throw in a book let me throw in a goodie let me throw on something that gets you over the edge and so you need and you target those people and so that's gonna get you another audience so every single ad you're running let's imagine you reach 20,000 people day you know 3,000 of them opted in those 17,000 other people are still interested people on the fence and that's how you can go out there and completely overhaul and this really works in any niche if you're doing e-commerce if you're doing internet marketing if you're doing any any type of direct marketing type niche out there this is how you do it and the only difference didn't switch between us if you're doing e-commerce is you're simply using the purchases or add to carts you can use add to carts or purchases to create your kind of pixel right here and there you go so I would ask you all with add the carts because then you can get a little bit bigger of an audience and get more data for to look like that's is to it another thing to do with your Shopify store upload your email lists upload your visitors if a person visits your site that means they're pretty interested you want to retarget the heck out of those people so these are some really quick tips on how to create really effective Facebook audiences they can get you the five to eight thousand ten thousand dollars a day ROI once you get to that you might need to get a little bit more creative or you might just need to do more of the same for example if I was in the skincare niche or something right now I could use these these audience that go super broad I could create audiences of three five million people and then use my pixel plus some interest retargeting to go out there and really really nail that down so you need to understand this is such a weapon and bigger niches and so this is all there is today and one thing I want to break down is market hero automatically syncs your email list to Facebook it goes and um builds these audiences for you it also tracks the ROI you're getting from every single email that comes in and so you're able to see ok
