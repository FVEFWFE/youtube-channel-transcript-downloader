hey there this is alex becker ceo of hyrus hopefully you can tell by the cool hoodie you should have been sent when you join hirus as well look in this video i just want to get into what makes our ads 10x cash profitable that's before recurring payments even come in i think that's something a lot of people enjoy having the reason behind it is our retargeting ads look for the longest time i thought retargeting ads were like a fun bonus round something that you just kind of tacked on however at hiros and across my other businesses i've seen as much as 40 to 60 percent of our sales come from our retargeting ad process which as you're going to see here is very in-depth there's over six different ways that we bring people back and hit them with different objections and closes and all sorts of structures that you're going to see here and the reason i did that is because when i started using hierarchy my own ads i saw that our customers were taking two to three weeks to book calls some people didn't buy any of our products for two months and i thought to myself wow it's much cheaper for me to get these people to come back for about a dollar fifty than getting another person to opt in for let's say ten dollars and this week's high-risk training which we send you every weekly in your email and posts in our group by the way join the group below we have over 40 million dollars in ad spend per month in the group it's the best place to be if you're a media buyer on facebook i'm not even joking there's no other group that has the qualifications we do to join and the quality of people inside it however we post this training there every single week so that's another cool perk as well and the reason why i'm telling you this you might be skeptical is this some highrose sales pitch no i want you to scale your ads so your ads make more money so that you a get higher us and b when you do get higher you're able to upgrade your account through making more money by telling you everything that we're doing to make more money for our businesses you make more money at your business and then hopefully you're going to be like hey if i track this i'd make more money and as you make more money i should probably upgrade my account that's it so it's in my best interest to just tell you everything i know which is exactly what we're gonna do right now so now we're in my computer let's talk about retargeting first off because when you see what we're doing you're gonna be like whoa that seems like overkill that is so much retarding man there are so many different places that get too and sent to why are you doing all that because if you're like me before i started using hiros to track my customers coming in i would think okay retargeting is like a fun bonus round we're going to make an extra 20 of sales with our high ticket funnels and other funnels i see at least 40 to 60 percent of our sales are coming from retargeting the funny funny thing is i see most people who come in i'm able to see very clearly in hiros they'll come in they'll click the first ad and they don't book a call with us or buy something for two to three weeks almost on average this is the same with lower ticket products as well and the number one way to make your ads work better is to simply make the people that you paid to get in the funnel let's imagine we're paying ten dollars to get a person into the funnel well every single person that doesn't buy in this funnel they're losing you money and i think that's a pretty obvious statement but it's so much easier to get this person who came in for ten dollars to buy for an extra dollar and fifty cents with some extra retargeting that is to get another person in for ten dollars and get them to buy it's just the most cost efficient thing you can possibly do and so retargeting is the best way to do this because while email marketing is a great way to follow up when we'll be talking about that next week there is one place you can consistently know your customer is going to be hanging out at it's going to be youtube or facebook or one of the properties that google or facebook owns you're always going to be able to follow up with them and you have to understand that when people come through a funnel if they don't buy right away doesn't mean they're not gonna buy when was the last time you bought something that you bought on the first attempt to sell it to you i can't remember the first time i've done that in years i don't know when i've seen an ad and just bought something i've usually seen an ad like four or five times you're a lot like me and i see the same exact thing in my high was tracking i can go look at my calls and this is the same thing for a webinar funnel or a standard funnel or even an e-commerce store but if i go through my calls right here that have came in which are what lead to sales you can see most of them come from retargeting ads you can see this person came in right here uh they came in from instagram and then they searched our name through a keyword on google this person right here came in through a facebook ad they came in through one of our meme ads this person came in right here from a facebook ad and then came back to another one of our retarding ads again person click their ad keyword ad person click their ad right for targeting ad almost half of these ads that i just went through right here they ended through a retargeting ad on top of it if we go look at some of these users history look how long it took to make the click happen the person clicked the first time in february person didn't call us until august okay that's an extreme example we can keep going through here person clicked right here in march clicked retargeting it again clicked again and this is june then finally called us after clicking retargeting ad in august this is why you need to run retargeting because it only cost me like a dollar fifty extra to get this person through it just took time and the most important thing too is i want to be able to attribute this first ad and this retargeting ad right here i don't want to stop either of them because if i just keep running this retarding ad without this ad it's going to slow down my sales and so it's also very important if you're watching this if you're a high-risk user to make sure when you're using your attribution mode if you want to see this you want to be using scientific mode because what's going to happen with your ads is let's say this is the first ad okay just add number one and this is the retargeting ad that they click 20 days later you want to be able to see both of these instances right here what scientific is going to do is if for example the retargeting ad is clicked within 30 days of the first the first ad is going to get credit if the retargeting ad is clicked after 30 days of the first ad then the retargeting ad is going to get credit so you're going to see which ad is much more relevant and you want to run your ads based on that we can also look at this in last click and we can also stretch this out we can even have the retargeting ads be ignored so that we won't see the retargeting ads show up in our main report so we can always source it back to the first ad so we can use that with email sources which will just remove any emails or retargeting ads from our reports and so that we can easily segment that and so we can separate that from our front ends and so we want to look at this from many different angles i usually just use the scientific mode that's what i personally do for this so what you must understand is what a retargeting campaign is it's the conversation it's like a sales process where you have let's just picture a car salesman trying to figure out why the person didn't buy and what angle you need to approach them at and so what happens when a person goes through our system is they go through the original ad which is going to present them with this sales video right here which makes a really strong case to buy our tracking shows all the customers that we have we have a long laundry list of basically every single big brand in the info industry but it makes a really strong case and so we do get a lot of calls from this first ad but i want to walk you through everything that happens afterwards and i have these ads that i'm about to show you hit them from all sorts of different angles so they're going to come in through the first ad they're going to opt in and we're going to have the retargeting pixel on them and over this time they're going to get hit with multiple ads there's going to be sending them back to the sales video again there's going to be a alternative sales video which makes another case there's going to be a straights the point sales video which just makes a straight roi case there's going to be a boot camp we send them to and then there's going to be brand ads and an faq ads you're like whoa what is going on here trust me when a person is thinking about buying something especially if it's high ticket you need to figure out why they didn't buy so at highrose why didn't they buy it well maybe they had a question that wasn't answered in the sales video maybe they just have a straight up feature question or maybe they didn't see the feature they want which is what the bootcamp does or maybe maybe they didn't see a clear roi which is what the straight hey you can see an roi here will just help you maybe they didn't maybe they're a person that doesn't need to see a sales pitch if you're like me i don't watch sales videos you you probably don't watch sales videos either getting me to sit down and watch a 15-minute sales video and then book a call you might as well expect me to do a cartwheel down the hallway while holding a cake in my left hand if you can picture that it would be pretty difficult to do so sometimes you just need to say hey look these are all the results we've gotten people just like you you should book a call because we'll give you the same results that's what would work on me other times you just need to send people back to the sales video because they didn't see it the first time other times you need to say hey look you know this was the point of the sales video book a call this is your last chance to kind of do so and then sometimes you just need to send people or get people a little bit more familiar with your brand so let me show you the pages for these so the straight sales video ad just right here we're just going to send them right back where some of the ad going right here i can easily track that next ad this is the landing page we send people to when we just want to make the case for our roi and you can see this the sales video right here is actually just five minutes of me talking about all the results we've got on our customers and again we just have a ridiculous amount of results for customers at hiros so that does help now here's where it starts to get really interesting with our bootcamp retargeting ads so our bootcamp retargeting ads are a little bit different because what i figure is going on when a customer doesn't opt in for a call or buy hiros if they are the target customer there has to be something that they're looking for that's important to them so we send them to a bootcamp which is really it's training it's very good training but it also lets them sell themselves see we have videos on each different way that you could use hi-ros to make more money from your business and so what people are most interested in they're going to click and so they're going to get training and then a sales video pitch at the end of it that basically offers them the exact offer that they're looking for this is why the boot camp works so well so we have retargeting ads going to all of these right here we have an ad that says hey are you interested increasing your ltv use hieros you want to use ai use highrose want to reduce your ad spend use higher risk want to scale further use hiros want to track your sales calls and webinars better use hieros and so we have those ads running at all times and so let's imagine a person lands right here on the webinar page they could watch this and go oh you know what i actually want to use ai to scale my ads or i want to actually use ltv that sounds cool too and so the person can kind of create their own custom sales process right here this works very well for us next we just send people sometimes with our retargets straight to a hey have you seen enough yet just come book a call come on book a call look at the results we've gone they're really really good book a call here's what we're going to do on the call and then finally we also send people to an faq page where we just answer feature questions this is everything we do to get people to come on the hiros and this is why our ads are so profitable our ads routinely generate a 5 to 10x cash roi in the money spent that's cash before recurring payments ever come in because we don't let the customer leave and then figure out a way to address that the other type of ads that we run the people are brand ads to just send people to our home page as you can see we have a really unique brand we have a really we're just weird frankly and we want people to know that about us we want people to be able to recognize our laser breathing ravens and see all customers and see all the different types of colors and everything we use and so a lot of times we'll just send people to our homepage with nike style ads we have ads that just have a raven breathing a laser that just say no at all very similar to nike ads with our tagline no at all and what that's meant to do is just make people understand what hirose is and get comfortable seeing hyrus everywhere and start to feel like this is not just some random brand that runs ads to them it's something that's part of the info marketing space which it is and so we'll do that a lot of times too and it kind of primes people for these other ads right here when you see the laser breathing raven and all the jokes and stuff we post in our retargeting ads it's going to lighten you up a lot more for these ads and you can only really do this if you're thinking long term with your business and that's exactly how we we run highros it's a very long term focused business and as you can see when we go and look at the sales that came in i want you to look at this this is the sales that came in just as i pulled this up this isn't prepared or anything for you this person came in threw a straight up ad came back to a keyword retargeting ad this person came in through a straight up ad came into a retargeting ad this person right here came up through a straight up came in through a retargeting ad this person right here came into a straight came from retargeting ad 7 out of 10 or 8 out of 10 of these sales that came in came from retargeting ads and this process right here if you took away our retargeting ads the business would fall apart literally the ads wouldn't work so this is why i wanted to walk you through this and by all means first off do what i just laid out right there think about long term and the conversation you're having with users because the best way to have that conversation is very cheaply retarding ads if you have a retargeting list of 20 000 people you can easily advertise to it for 100 150 bucks a day very efficiently so that being said there's no better way to maximize your roi than getting that person you paid ten dollars for to get in to come back and buy for an extra dollar 50 instead of getting another 10 opt-in you already have your best customers there you need to maximize it finally i mean this is gonna be super hard for you to track without hyrus i'm not trying to be biased here but i don't know how i could see this and i don't know how i could track what retarding ads are working and more so connect it back to the original ad if you're using facebook or google tracking you're only going to see the last ad click that's not very useful because the first ad clicked right here is part of the puzzle too seeing the entire history of the user is imperative to knowing how to make your retargeting work you can't just be running ads willy-nilly and running front-end ads that you don't know are working which is what most people do so if you'd like to book a call with us as well to get this set up in your business you can go below and book a call with us and we'll show you how to do this on the call we'll show you how we structure our retargeting and we'll even assist you in setting this up in your business by the way every ohio's transaction has a 90-day result guarantee so if you don't see these type of results you don't pay on top of that if you want more help on running ads and specifically scaling your business with google ads or the funnels that we use you can also book a call with me below our iron ad training and i'll walk you through the sales funnels that i'm using for my webinars sales call funnels and have you even used an e-commerce and sas to actually generate 18 000 subscriptions at my other sas company and over 8 000 high ticket sales and you can hop on a call with me and i'll walk you through that and we can help you with actually scaling your ads as well just do tactics alone so that's all there is to it this has been a high rose training i hope you enjoyed it and we'll see you next week where i'll be talking about our email follow-up structure which is well i'll just show you a glimpse of it right here it's kind of a monster we have almost a six-week follow-up process that i'll be walking you through next week that basically allows us to really follow up on this retargeting process you can see here's the bootcamp retargeting email process then we have three other funnels the person goes to and i'll be walking you through what we do in those funnels as well next week so that being said this has been alex becker ceo of hiros i'll see you in the group i'll see you around let's hang out and i hope to see inside of hybris as well until next time take it easy
