================================================================================

internet marketing skis bag in this video I'm going to show you an ad source that essentially no one is using right now and the few people that are using it are using it wrong now as you know I'm the best ADR runner in the history of the entire internet so of course I know about this ad source and I am also using it right Jokes Aside though that's exactly what you're going to see in this video and I have to Hype it up with that goofy intro that fry fruy way of introduce things because this is the most gray generic boring ad Source there is it is Google search it is the oldest form of ads in our generation and nobody's really using this everybody always writes us out especially in internet marketing but I'm going to show you today how we're using it to generate millions and millions of dollars at our business crazy phenomenal return it's like 10 to one on some of these ads and the thing is that most people and most businesses most internet marketing businesses just don't use it because they think it's too expensive or they don't know how so what I'm going to do in this video is point blank let you look at our ads and I'm going to show you how I write our ads for this so you can then just go and this because I thought search ads were stupid for the longest time I just like the keywords don't convert it's it sucks whatever but I've been using them a lot recently at hyos and I've been advising and looking at other few businesses and it's just been shaking money which is kind of surprising to me because I spent tens and tens of millions of dollars in ads over the years generated and built two eight figure businesses one nine figureure business and this is really the first time I've been getting around to this and what I'm also seeing in hyos as you know I'm the CEO of one of the largest ad tracking companies in the world right now what I'm seeing is a again a lot of people in hyros are not using search ads but the few that are it is absolutely printing money for them when they're doing it right so this is something you really want to look at right now and understand I think it and a gdm display network are the two most underrated ad sources right now that nobody's using and you should figure them out so without further Ado let me take you behind some of our ads and kind of show you my theory and strategy behind this and this works for all types of businesses more so what I'm going to focus on here is internet marketing and digital businesses not so much local businesses that people mostly use it for so let's hop into it we're inside the Google campaign manager and I just want to break down how we're doing this how we're making money now we're looking at two types of campaigns right here we're looking at our gdn campaigns we're also looking at our search campaigns I'm using keyword targeting for both of these which is why I'm going to talk about both so Nuts and Bolts real quick the value per call if we get it from Facebook or Instagram or anything like that is going to be about $11,000 at hyos give or take now I'm not trying to make apples apples to your business I'm just showing you our kind of margins with this now also the way we're getting those margins the way we're tracking that return is by tracking the lead for years when it comes in so for example if we get a call we're tracking all the rebuilding that's likely to happen all the sales that are likely to come in all the extra purchases all the things in total and we average that all together they get their LTV or their value per lead over about a year and a half that's how we do business at hos and that's how you really should be running ads because that allows us to buy ads super duper aggressively because we can see everything the lead is going going to buy over years by the way if you don't know how to do that hyos does that for you uh literally just day one you just plug your data in the hyros and will show you the amount your leads from any type of source are going to spend with you which is why we can easily see when leads come in from Facebook I mean Google in this instance right here from Search terms when they come in from Search terms the value per call is about $1,500 these convert a lot higher and they spend a lot more with us I think the quality of customers from search is just higher now the final thing I'm going to point out right here is look I want to teach you this right now but I don't know how to teach you this without you tracking it properly you can see right here um just from this search term right here hyros uh the tracking solution I'm talking about right here caught 1,500 calls right here Google caught 452 you can just see the tracking is way off there's huge differences in the amount of calls tracked and so I wouldn't be able to do this if I was using Bas tracking I don't know how anybody actually runs their ads still with base Facebook or Google tracking because it's blocked like Crazy by iPhones and all sorts of other devices so you're just not getting accurate stats so please if you want to actually apply with in this video maybe once you start making money come check out hus and track your ads correctly because you're not able to use or get the accurate value of your customers and you're not even able to see the base leads coming in so please do that now I want to explain the theories behind this and how I make this work so first things first I'm going to show you the keywords we're targeting in this one campaign and it's nothing crazy uh obviously for example hyos my company is a attribution software so we're targeting keywords like ad tracking and attribution software so I can come in here and you can see the keywords that I'm targeting you can see its things like attribution software ad tracking software and I can even come down here and see the cost per conversion on average right here this isn't wildly accurate and I can go into hros and actually see the accurate stats right here but this is good enough to show me which ads or keywords are in general getting us the best cheapest leads you can see ad tracking software is it right here so one thing I want to point out to you if you're watching this I'm doing this at scale right here if you have a new business where you're only trying to make a couple hundred thousand or a million bucks a year you could easily come in and snipe keywords to do massive returns you can get really cheap leads that convert really really highly from the Search terms if you know how to build the ads correctly which I'm going to show you to do so if I was just trying to run a smaller business I'd come and just Target this keyword right here but you can see we're targeting just everything the whole Dogg and carriage but if I really wanted to optimize this I would just lower it to a broad search targeting for just the keyword ad tracking software that said if we come here and we look at the ads I want to show you how I make these so you can see this isn't a very complicated ad I'm going to bring it up so you can see the entire term and I want to show you how I'm building these so what we want to do is one we want to make our ads based around the keyword okay so right now the keyword right here is AD tracking so you can see when I come down here most accurate ad tracking optimize AI for higher ad Roi see highrisk reviews in Tech jet fuel for ad tracking for info businesses and AI optimization for growth now let me explain how I'm using all these together right here obiously what I'm building is you're going to have three of these shows so you're going to see one two three in some instances or sometimes it we'll show twoo so what Google is going to do is it's going to come and grab these headlines right here and place these in and so it's going to require you to write three headlines and it's going to go and place them in here so what I like to do is I want to throw a combination of different types the headlines in there I don't don't want to repeat myself over and over if you look at most other businesses when they're running Search terms they just repeat the same thing over and over again I want to hit them from different angles okay so I have most accurate ad tracking that's obviously what they're looking for right there but what I want to also do is I want to throw in things that are going to Peak their interest and get them to actually click it over other ads so you can see right here I say optimize AI for higher ad Roi and I also have say AI OB ad optimization for growth why it doesn't make any sense it's a little bit vague and it combos in with this ad tracking right here to make them think that we have something that they haven't seen every other business advertising right here is just like ad tracking it's really accurate we have ad tracking mine is like ad tring we have a special AI or ad tracking see reviews in Tech okay and so what I want to do is I want to have something that triggers and gets them to click you can also see I put in something right here tracking for info businesses and if I can go back I'm going to add something for Ecom businesses as well right here because we also want to call out to the type of person that's watching you have you have to understand when someone searches for something they see a bunch of different search ad returns from other businesses and you have to be able to beat those other businesses because they skim through there they're also looking at all the other Search terms so you have to create a a question in their head or an ad that's more interesting than the other people on the page advertising and the Search terms so I'm using the terms like AI optimization and these reviews and Tech to get people to click now what I also do right here is in the description right here I want to add something that creates a story that they're going to want to click I don't want to just tell them like hey we have really accurate ad tracking or hey we have this thing that you're looking for I want to say it's a revolutionary tracking attribution system that combines print tracking plus AI now a little tip right there yes the the type of tracking we do we call it print tracking there and we do use AI to optimize Google and Facebook AIS and everything like that to to get better returns but what I'm doing right here is I'm not really going into detail on those and I'm using a lot of buzzwords like print tracking and AI to get people to go what the heck is going on here I want to create this news story or this type of headline that gets people like thinking okay this is different than everything else on this page this isn't just ad tracking this is something I've never heard about before so you want to make something that seems new they've never heard about before so obviously then we want to attach it to what they care about this allows advertisers to track traffic and scale ads more accurately never before okay so we just created this huge story right here that they're going to make more money we have something they never seen before it's brand new uh and we'll also back it up and prove it now finally what you can see right here at the very very bottom is we have these site links right here let me make sure you can see these so what I use the site links for this is the final kind of finish to the ad is I go and put everything they're going to doubt about this in the ad so I have C proof and results because they might think this is BS or bogus so I put C proof and results and then I need to think about who is most likely to be looking at this ad or be needing this ad so I say increase Google ad Roi increase calls from ads SASS and info ad all right so I I call out the Target or types of different types of customers that would be looking at this ad if I can go back here I'm actually going to change this up to add a lot of Ecom in here because that's where like people are getting crazy results right now with hyros but you can see what I'm doing right here do you see how many different layers of conversation I'm having with the person just in this one ad all right I'm not just saying hey come get ad tracking I'm saying come get ad tracking we have something brand new that's revolutionary it's unlike anything else you see on this page specifically if you're this type of customer and if you think we're both come see these proof and results this is everything I'm accomplishing just in this short little ad and it's all focused around again the search term ad tracking okay so that's super duper duper important you can see this is the ad right here that did the best out of all these ones right here all right there's a few other headline examples right here that you can look at that I was using you can zoom in I think all these ones are really good this is the one that did the best okay this is the one that did the the best so maybe the number one most accurate or using like a headline like that works really well uh I'm sure we can actually go into the headlines and we we can and see which headlines are actually the ones getting the most clicks now I want to show you how we're doing this in a another type of search term that's actually paying off for us really well so first thing I want to show you is how we're doing this for like really broad weird keywords now the cost per call that comes in from this is a little bit higher but also the conversions are are much much higher on this keyword than they are with the with other keywords or even on other AD platforms so what I'm doing right here is I'm running the same exact type of AD as had before but I'm targeting the keyword Facebook ads this is something that has nothing to do with ad tracking and so what I'm doing is I'm converting people that are looking for something else into high-risk customers you can do this with I'm going to give you a few different keyword ideas similar software are softwares in your industry so for example I'm going to go after stuff like clickfunnels or go high level or Shopify okay what type of businesses are running ads and what software would those businesses use what are the things they're trying to do all right they're trying to run Facebook ads Google ads they're trying to make more money from ads they're trying to look for ad strategies so those are all keywords I'm going to look for in your business think about your Target customer and think about supplemental things they're going to look for so for example let's say you were selling like agency services or something like that what are other things that agencies are looking for what other type of content are they searching for online Target those type of keywords so you can see I'm targeting people that are looking for Facebook ads right here and that's obviously where most the clicks and everything are coming from obviously if a person is looking for information on Facebook ads they are going to be someone it's running ads thus they're going to want to make Max money from their ads thus they're probably going to want to use hyros so what I'm going to do right here is you can see I've done the same exact type of ads but I've altered the keywords to focus on Facebook ads so if we come down here and look at these this is the highest converting one scale Facebook ad profit guarantee AI tracking gross Facebook ads you can see I'm using the same type of strategies that I'm using in the other videos now you can also see I'm using the C proof and results and also increase Google ad Roi to also Target people that would also be using Google ads or care about those proof and results but you can see how I'm altering the headlines based on the keyword so that was just something I wanted to throw in there just give you some ideas when it comes to targeting other keywords this works really well for us but the cost for lead is a little bit expensive on it that's fine because again we're getting people in the hos and then we're getting our return on Revenue about 6 months in from when we get them in not every business can do that and you have to have kind of specific tracking to do that that previous examp example that I showed it it was really laser tight that's almost profitable like week one keywords like this are profitable like 3 months in 4 months in and really pay off in about a year and a half which is completely fine for me that's like being able to put $100 in a stock and make like a 3X Roi on it guaranteed in a year and a half and that's that's how we run the business and that's how you want to be running your ads overall the final thing I also want to show you is that we've also had some very very good results targeting ads based around our competitors so what we want to do right here when you're targeting your competitors keywords which we do is one of our one of our chief competitors is a really great company called triple wh I'm not here to talk about triple wh or anything about I think it's a great company I think there's a lot of things we beat them in but I'm not here to like bash triple wh in this video or anything like that I have a lot of respect for the company but of course we want to we're competing here so I want to get their customers so what we're looking at right here is you can see I'm obviously targeting our competitors keywords right here now I want to just show you how I write these ads so when a person's going and Googling these ads what they're looking for is obviously the company that they're searching for so what I have to do is I have to create a story about how we're better than this company and I really have to think about what type of customer we're going to be advertising to right here so for example if someone's looking for triple wh they're probably very interested in e-commerce tracking now there's a lot of ways that we beat triple wh when it comes to really highlevel e-commerce they're absolutely phenomenal at really like small level small e-com stor when it comes to really big ones we have a lot of things that they do not have so that's what I want to lay into in this ad right here so first thing you can see right here is I've actually changed the landing page of the website based around the type of customers that's coming through here so what I focus on right here is communicating that we're for big e-commerce stores and that's where we see the best results because with hyros the most important thing is the long-term numbers and the actual metrics and being able to optimize those fine details and you really don't run into those problems until you're at large scale like 50,000 100,000 a month from your e-com Commerce store and ads and that's where highis really starts to take away because of the better tracking and all the long-term Revenue analysis that we're able to do plus the AI optimization and whatnot but regardless of that you can see how I'm using that to tell this story right here I'm not trying and saying like H Ros Ecommerce tracking that's really good I'm trying to say if you're this type of customer you might want to try us over triple wall in this example right here and so our panded print tracking AI is the highest level of tracking for Ecom businesses for serious High l Ecom um businesses on or off Shopify what I'm also doing right here is I'm telling the story of how we're different we don't just work with Shopify we work with every single Ecom platform and we talk about how we're focusing on High level Ecom right here all right so again you're seeing the same type of site links that we've used in other videos or other ads same kind of strategy with there I just want to show you how we're targeting that a little bit differently than other keywords so those are the three ways and keywords that we're using to get a lot of results with Google keywords I didn't show you all of our campaigns we have running cuz I don't want to give away everything that we're doing and all of our keywords but those are a few really good examples now if you're looking for the funnels and actual things you want to run these ads too again that's all over this channel everything I know about advertising is on this channel 100% for free because I want you to go and get results with your ads when you start making a little bit more money you're probably going to want to track your ads and you're going to think about hro so everything here the funnel the sales strategies the copywriting techniques all below this video as well you want to see how we're running YouTube ads and our scripts there there you want to see our scripts on our Facebook ads you want to see the landing pages we're using it's all there and this is all proven across my businesses and what I'm seeing working across billions of dollars of AD spend by being the CEO of hyos so you should check all those out and I'll see you in the next video
