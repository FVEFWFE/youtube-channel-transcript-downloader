================================================================================

So, I was sitting on my couch the other day thinking to myself, man, I'd really love to be a giant piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right now. So, I thought about the shittiest thing I could possibly do, which was pull out my phone and start perusing X, the AIDS armpit of the internet. Anyways, as I was scrolling through there, I saw another content creator, young guy. This isn't a poop on him, but he was very upset, very, very, very mad because he had just made his first million dollars in a year or something like that. And he recently then discovered what his tax bill was going to be. It was especially bad cuz he was living in the communist bisexual empire of California, which if the taxes you don't know there, it's like 54%. It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] insane, but at least they get good social services and it's really safe in LA and stuff. All right. Anyways, we're not going to talk about that. Anyways, he stated, paraphrasing, "Fuck, the only way you can actually get rich in America is by making a hund00 million company and selling it." He was very disheartened. It's it sucks, you know, the first time you make money is see your tax bill. I thought to myself, I bet that guy would like to actually know how to get rich and how to not actually pay any taxes for it at all, which I know how to do. This last year, I in fact increased my net worth by $50 million, and I didn't pay a single s in tax for it. And what I'm going to do in this video is I'm going to show not only this angry kid on the internet, but I'm also going to show you how to actually go and become wealthy in the United States of America without paying any taxes. And I'm going to show you the best way, even if you live in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Hogwarts, it doesn't matter where you live, even if you don't pay taxes. This is still the best way to get rich as fast as possible. See, what I'm going to show you in this video is a core understanding that rich people, me, have that poor people, you simply do not have. I don't know anybody outside of my little tight group of rich friends that understand this. Nobody thinks like this. When I spell it out to people, it's like I'm speaking French. It's really not even that complicated. But if you understand this, you're not only going to be able to not pay taxes forever and just basically pay nothing. You ever see AOC and all the Democrats being like, "The rich don't pay taxes." They're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right. We don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. It's because of how we move money around and how we store money and how we borrow money. And it actually comes down to the fact that we actually never make any money on paper. And you'll actually see the reason why we don't pay taxes is actually very fair, which I'm going to break down this video. But the cooler thing about this video is I'm going to break down how you can make money as fast as possible. Look, he said the only way you can get rich is building a $100 million company. Sort of. The way you get rich in America or anywhere is you actually don't focus on income. You don't try and make money, you try to build equity value, which is what I'm going to teach you right now. Let's begin. Now, look, this video is going to be actually about understanding money. If you want the actual business tactics, every single month, I give away all my old courses I used to make. It's like $20,000 worth of courses, all my sales techniques, all my business growing techniques, how I run ads, copywriting, everything. I give it away to all my subscribers in my community tab. But you have to be subscribed or you won't see that post. So, go subscribe. Click that little button right now. And I'm going to give you tons of other supplemental content to go along with this that's on the channel as well because uh I've already made enough money that I don't have to sell you courses like everybody else on YouTube. Let's begin. So, I know what you're thinking. How on earth did this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] grow his net worth $50 million a year and you have to actually factor in that doesn't even include my income. That's just my net worth gains. On top of that, I make tens of millions of dollars a year on top of that. So, this video is going to be very useful. It's coming from a person that actually knows what they're doing instead of a person that makes YouTube videos on business that sell you courses on business. And everything I'm going to focus on this video comes from my software companies, not my crypto trading or investment or sleazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. This is all just good oldfashioned business that you can go and learn from, too. At the end of this video, I'll break down the business and how it grows and everything I do right there. But you have to have this understanding that I'm going to break down right now first or you won't get any of that. So, look, the way most people think you get rich is you make a lot of income. So, for example, if we look at the worst [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] quarterback of all time, just like the most overpaid piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] quarterback, the most overpaided employee in the history of employees, Dak Prescott of the Dallas Cowboys, uh, this guy makes $40 million a year. And everybody thinks this is how you get rich. You go and make a lot of money in income. So, this guy gets paid $40 million a year to throw 10 yard passes like a 15year-old girl. And people think, "Oh, wow. He's made it." But after you look at everything he does and all the agents and all the stuff he probably has to pay, he probably makes like $20 million per year. Then probably spends five of that. And then at the end of all this, he's probably left with about $15 million a year. So this is really good. And I'm just really taking this opportunity to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on Dak Prescott. It doesn't really have to do anything with my point. My point is one, if you look at all the money he's making, he's really not keeping much of it at the end of the day. Over the span of a 10-year career, it's only about 150 million, not 400, $500 million like people think. So one, that sucks. And that's just one expresses point number one. It's really hard to actually make money in America if you are going through income alone. Even if you're getting paid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tons of money, like you have to make so much damn money to make a net worth from this. And then you can't even keep any of this. You have to go and invest it if you actually want to be safe. This is a bummer. And so what you have to focus on when you want to get good at making money is you never actually try to make income because income's kind of stupid because it's a double-edged sword. See, let's imagine I'm going and building a business and it's making a million dollars per year in profit. So, let's say we have a $2 million per year business. 1 million in profit. Now, what every person is going to do is they're going to pay themselves this $1 million in profit. Now, there's a few angles we can go with this. A lot of people are going to be like, "No, just keep investing in your business, keep growing your business." Yes, that's that's correct, but you have to understand at the core level what we're trying to do if we're trying to make money here. So, look, if we pay ourselves to $1 million right here, we're going to pay at least 400k in taxes on that alone. Now, I'm not going to really focus on taxes too much here because if you don't want to pay taxes, just move to Dubai. It's that simple. The end. Okay, that's the solution. The point here is how to build wealth as fast as possible while also not paying taxes. So, when you're building a business, paying yourself from the business is a double-edged sword because not only does the money leave the business, but it also stops the business from growing. So for example, if we invest a million dollars in hiring like a really talented employee, new infrastructure, whatever, the business could have grown to maybe $4 million the next year. And if we reinvest the money, then it can invest it, then it could have grown to $10 million. But let's imagine we don't make money this entire time. You're thinking to yourself right now, well, what's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] point? Why am I doing this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's because of this. See, when you're building a business up, let's imagine we get a business to $10 million per year, and there's potential for profit. we just keep reinvesting the money into the business and that's what keeps growing the business. Look, if you have a $10 million business per year and you're losing $10 million and you're breaking even on it, that's not good. If you have a business that's maybe making $10 million per year and you could take home $5 million in profit, but you're reinvesting the profit to grow the business, the business keeps growing and that's going to look really, really good on paper because of this. See, if you're in a business that has that situation, the value of this business on a low multiple is about $50 million. On a decent multiple, it's probably anywhere from 80 to $100 million. So, if you're in like tech or something like me, you could pull a fugazi and value your company at 10x. I don't do that. Whenever I mention my company values, I base it off of offers our company has received or the lowest possible multiples in our niche. So, for example, in software, I usually base my company values on like a fourish to fiveishx on revenue or based on past offers that we've received. So, I'm not just pulling out 10x multiples like every other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on YouTube who makes like a million dollars and it says their company's worth 100 million. That's not what I'm doing here. But, we're here to focus on you. All right. So, the business at this point, let's say you get it to $10 million per year, which I know you're thinking, "Oh my gosh, whatever." Just work with these same multiples in whatever business you're building. Maybe it's a million dollar per year. I'm just using 10 mil as a reference right here. So, this business right here is now worth, let's say, lowend $50 million. Now, we got it to this point because we didn't pay ourselves and we kept reinvesting the money back into the business to grow the business as fast as possible. Now, you're thinking, well, how do I actually make money? Well, the business is valued on paper at $50 million. Okay? So, if you own 100% of that business, you now have $50 million if you sold the company, which we don't want to do because moving like this prints money. See, look, if we were to go and say we have this this business that's making $10 million per year, and we have the potential to take five mil out every single year, but we put the five mil back in and we use that to grow the business to $15 million per year, theoretically, right? So, instead of paying ourselves, we send the five down here and we grow it to $15 million per year. You see right here, based on the multiples, that 5 million equates an actual valuation of the company to about 25 million. So, instead of making 5 million right here, we just made another 25 million in actual net worth. You see how this works? Instead of paying ourselves, we pay the company and we use the money strategically to grow the company. Look, if your business is doing $10 million per year with $5 million profit, you can probably find a way to invest $5 million to grow it another 50%. Hell, you could just go buy another company with that money or something to grow the value of the company if you want. You can be real cheeky like that. So again, you're thinking, what's the point? When do I actually get to make money here? So, what you can easily do, especially when rates are lower, which they're about to do, is you can go and now we have this $75 million company because we didn't pay ourselves. What we can then do is borrow against this company. We can borrow all sorts of money. We can go borrow $30 million against the company to do whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we want. You want to buy a house, you want to do whatever, you can go do that. Now, what I suggest doing is you buy other assets with this money. So, for example, what you can do from the company is pay yourself very little. Let's say out of the $75 million per year. And again, I understand these numbers are outrageously high for a lot of people watching this. This is fine. You can use this at lower numbers, too. So, let's imagine you pay yourself $500,000 a year in living expenses or something like that. A very small fraction of what the company's making, but the company allows you to borrow $30 million. You could go and get a $10 million house, a Lamborghini if you want, and if you're really smart, you'll start actually buying houses and cars and other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that appreciates in value. So, for example, that Lamborghini Ultima behind me, very, very rare form of Lamborghini with almost no miles on it. I don't drive it because the thing is an investment. The thing is going to appreciate year. It's already up a lot of money since I bought it. And so, you can see what I'm able to do is I'm able to have my cake and eat it too with my investments. I actually don't even like cars very much. I use it because it gets your guys' attention in videos. And I actually do like that car a lot, but the thing makes money like a stock. Regardless, when you're buying assets with money you borrow against the company, you can do that to then make the assets make you more money as well. increasing your net worth over time in a funny way, especially if rates are low. They've been very high the last few years, you're paying 5% on a loan or something like that, they're going to get back down to 1 2%. You buy an asset, for example, like that car behind me, it depreciates 5 6 7 8% a year. You're printing money while having fun at the same time. Just a little general tip for you. But the most important thing right here is that if we go and get the house, we go and pay a rent, we go and do whatever with this, we're taking money out of the company that we're not going to be taxed on. So, we just bought a $10 million house. we're not going to be taxed on that. And then when we sell the money, we just give the money right back to the company and there's no tax on that. And so our goal really when we're trying to get rich period is one, if we have $500, if we put the $500 in our pocket, the $500 is gone. If we have $500 and we put it back in the company, their $500 if it's used to grow the company in equivalent amount is worth $2,500. We can get a 5x on our money net worthwise and then we can borrow against the value of that. So we can grow our net worth and that money that we have access to very very very quickly. Now finally the last cool part about this is that when you want to make a lot of money as the company grows quickly and the companies get bigger value the multiples and everything start to go up as well. And so what you want to start doing when you think about how you build your businesses is I didn't do this for like the first 15 years of my career is I was just focused on okay making two mill a year now I want to make five million a year. Now I want to make 10 mill a year. Okay that's great and all but that's not really the main point of the business. The point of the business is so for example at Hyros we really re received an offer last year for about $150 million give or take. This is the valuation of the company last year. Since that time last year has grown 40% and we're on pace to do about 50% growth this year. So even on the lowest of low end I've grown my net worth at least another 30 $50 million just from this giving me access to tons of capital if I so want it which I don't want right now. I could even go and just take a part of the company and sell Hyros, sell 10% for 15 million right now if I wanted something like that, but I don't want to do that right now. I'm just showing you that by going and investing the money back in the company as much as I can. I still get paid very well from my companies and building new technology in it. I've managed to increase my net worth substantially more than I ever could in income. If I wanted to go and pay myself $50 million a year from higher, it's just not going to happen. That's an insurmountable amount of money. But I can add it to my net worth and then I can actually borrow from it. And if I want to, I could go find a buyer for the company. And that's how you get rich. You want to focus on growing the long-term value of your businesses because a you don't pay taxes when the value of the business goes up. That's unrealized capital gains. This is like Elon Musk, for example. A lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] people think that Elon Musk has like $400 billion sitting in a bank account. He's just hoarding all of it and rubbing on his body. He probably has maybe a billion dollars liquid across everything. I would be surprised if he had if he had access to more capital than that at any given time. Of course, he can raise money. Of course, he can sell stock for that. But he has absolutely no access to those gains because all of it is in his companies. And so, he focused on growing the value of his companies. And that's what's made him so rich on paper. And he borrows all the things he does. And I don't think he has an extravagant lifestyle, but he could. He borrows those things to buy other companies and moves money around by using that paper net worth to borrow. This is what every single rich person does. They never make income. If you see anybody make a lot of money, they're not keeping the money, unless they're just pure stupid. So, first you want to focus on growing the money, not only because a it's not taxed, but b it's the fastest way to grow your net worth. If you take the money out and store it, it's going to cut the thing that's growing. It's like you have a plant and you just keep picking all the the the corn off of it when the corn is what makes it grow. That's not how plants work at all. But hopefully you get the metaphor. And then finally, when it comes to tax, if you're paying if you're taking income out, again, you're just really shooting yourself in the foot because you're destroying the thing that's going to grow the business, that's going to grow the valuation of the business, and you're unpaid, you're going to pay really large taxes on it. If you do end up selling the business someday, what's going to happen is you're only going to pay 20% taxes on it because of long-term capital gains. So again, you're just winning, winning, winning. And then when you have that money left in the business, if you can find ways to invest in things in the business that allow you to then wipe the slate, clean the business, then the business isn't making any money, so it doesn't even pay any corporate taxes either. You have to be smart with this. Get a CPA. I'm not giving you any advice right here. There's but there's legal ways and compliant ways, which I suggest you do to do all these things. But this right here is how you go and actually become rich in America. You don't go and try and make a million dollars per year and then keep all of it. One, yeah, you're gonna get taxed the hell, especially if you live in communist California. But two, it's a very inefficient way to make money. You you don't want to be spending your years trying to make money like Dak Prescott. You barely get to keep any of the money that you make. What you want to do is you want to go and build things longterm and continue to reinvest the money to get a 5x, a 10x on the money that you put into it. And it's just free money growing up your net worth that you can then borrow against tax-free. This is how rich people get rich.
