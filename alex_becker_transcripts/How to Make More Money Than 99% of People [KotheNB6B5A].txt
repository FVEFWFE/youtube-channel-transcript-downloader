================================================================================

Ah, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I can literally hear you groaning right now, thinking to yourself, "Oh, look, another douchebag on YouTube in front of a Lamborghini claiming that he can tell me the secrets to making money in the next 10 minutes." I can literally smell your skepticism from here. And frankly, it pisses me off, which is why I'm about to deliver a full frontal cleansing load of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you as I literally do just that. In the next 10 minutes or so, I'm going to give you a core understanding of money that is going to allow you to make more money than literally everyone you know because the way they view money and the way to make money is fundamentally wrong because they've been programmed by pure nitwitery. And in this one video, if you can actually focus, we're actually going to solve the entireing problem in one video. No courses. I don't have some mastermind or some Discord channel I want you to pay me money for. I don't want your money. I don't want to teach you. I don't want all your baggage. I'm already rich. We're just going to solve this problem now. You're going to understand this and for the rest of your life, you're going to know how to make money about a hundred times more efficiently than everyone you meet. And I mean everyone you meet because they're lacking this core understanding, which I'm going to teach you right now. So, here's the reason why everyone is so bad at making money. And it's not entirely their fault. It's it's mostly their fault, but not entirely. See, in our society, the way that it's broadcasted that we should go about making money and all the systems we should operate through and the the railroads and train tracks or whatever we want to do, the bumpers we want to stick within to make money. All these systems and flows are built by midwits. And once you see this, you're not going to be able to unsee it. And you have to understand what a midw is and why they designed all the systems like this and why you shouldn't operate this way because it's not actually how you make money. See, what midwits actually are are masters of impersonating the appearance of intellect and the appearance of competence. And so, if you ever seen the the chart out there, the Midwit chart, you got you got the full-blown [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] retards on the left, and then you got the geniuses on the right, and then you got most of society who's intelligent enough to want to succeed and be successful, but not smart enough to actually comprehend or do anything advanced that delivers results or achieves any kind of leverage. So, I'm going to take down the Midwood chart and I'm going to explain this to you because once you get this, you're going to see how to actually make [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tons of money without having to ask anyone for it. So, we're going to ignore the full-blown retards right here because they're fine. Actually, they're happy. Like, you you're probably in this area right here where you're you're smart enough to realize that you want something more out of life and drinking a beer while eating Chipotle followed up by an extremely satisfying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh isn't isn't enough for you. It is enough for these people right here and they're fine. We're not going to bug them. and we're going to leave them alone. But the problem that you're running into right here is that what midlets do is again like I talked about, they love to mimic competency and intelligence. And what they think these are are big words and the degrees and job titles and the corporate ladder and a bunch of other things. And then there's people out there that are not midwits. They're very smart and they just deliver results and they don't have to ask anyone to make money ever. They just get paid lots of money. I'm sure you've probably met lots of people, myself being one of them, and you here very soon, that really doesn't ever have to do the whole job career thing. They're just reallying good at things and deliver results and demand whatever money they want. For example, I had a software developer that worked for me at one of our NFT brands, Neotokyo, and he just built the initial launch from it. He made millions of dollars from doing that as our employee. How could he do that? Because he was just really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good at coding NFT tech at the time when no one else was. He just purely got results. He didn't have any title. He didn't have any whatever. He was just a little icon in Discord and his code name was something out of a 1980s video game. This right here is a smart person. He delivers results. Now, see what midwits are is people that can't deliver results. They're really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid people, but they realize that they have to hide in society or better yet build systems and structures around the making of money that protects them and embeds them in it like a little leech. Because midwoods have a giant problem. They're not smart enough to deliver results. They're not good enough at anything to deliver results, but there's a lot of them. And so what they do because they can't think through problems, they can't reach the end solution of problems is they create complex systems and hierarchies in society that allow them to embed themselves into these systems and control these systems and control who goes up and down in these systems. And this is how they're able to go and achieve wealth and positions of power without ever actually delivering results. Have you ever seen politicians or most people in corporate America? I've hired lots of corporate people before. I'm sure you maybe have worked somewhere in corporate America or in a in a business or something like that. You've noticed a lot of the people there don't deliver any results whatsoever. Even the people very high up the ladder. They don't do anything. Like they literally just sit around and talk and do calls and simulate what it looks like to be a smart person all day. They sit around and use words like aligned and complicated jargon and worship all sorts of politics in the workspace and things they think that sound smart like cultural identities of businesses and all sorts of other haikus and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] If you ever seen most of Silicon Valley like not the show, the actual place. This is like what 90% of it is. It's a bunch of midwits who are simulating what they think a smart person looks like and in creating structures and how you go up and down the structure is you play the game of midwits. the people that convert it and get go places rarely are people that actually do anything. Now, trust me, I'm going to explain this midwit theory to you and it's going to tie into you making money. And we're going to get you to the point where you understand how to make money like this person down here. So, bear with me. I have you have to deeply understand this cuz then you're going to see the entire system of society that's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and why making money is so confusing until you get this. So now that you understand and you're starting to see the hive mind of midwits that control society, this is when it's going to start becoming apparent why it's so confusing to make money because we are mostly ran by midwits. And so they create these architectures like the college system or the corporate ladder or corporations or uh the endless [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's in the medical field or the legal field. There's just endless endless complexity and nonsense [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that gets no results ever. doesn't help anybody and is only defended to support itself. If you notice, for example, a lot of people in the legal field, they don't do anything. They just complexify everything and complexify and complexify and they make money from all the complexity. If you notice a lot of doctors, they can't actually get results for their patients. They do nothing, but they embed themselves in this medical field and medical research field where nothing can get done without them. Same thing with politicians, whatever. You see these systems everywhere once you see it. And so when you get out of school or high school, you think to yourself, how do I get many money? And if you look at your parents and you look at everybody else in society, they they think the only way to do it is these midweight systems because that's what they tell you on TV. That's what's mainly been broadcast the last 50 60 years. People are starting to see through it now, but not all of them. And so then the desire that you have making money becomes very confusing because there isn't a straightforward way to get there because you have to play these stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] systems. Like why do you have to go to college and learn nonsense for 4 years and get a piece of paper to go work at a corporation to do things for them and then when you get there it's not really on the results you deliver or how hard you work. You work 80 hours a week. It doesn't matter. It's how you play the the corporate system and the political system at your office and excel at being in meetings all day because that's what most midws do. They sit around and make powerpoints and sit in meetings all day and like don't contribute anything and then they all get together and make endless meetings and hire tons of other midwits together so that the entire company eventually is made up of midwits and you can't remove one midweight because he has like a thousand other midwits attached to him and they become like this aids in your company you can't get rid of. You've seen it happen and all the Silicon Valley companies especially with all this woke [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That's where it thrived. Like mid woke [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was midwit heaven because for the first time ever you could excel in a job without actually delivering any results whatsoever. As long as you just played the woke game very well. A few woke people get hired then they hire more woke people and an entire hierarchy of the business works around woke people. Woke people and midwits are almost interchangeable. Like woke was like the the Super Bowl of Midwits when it was very popular a couple years ago. Anyways, when you're presented with this tall mountain of midw debauchery stupidity [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it becomes incredibly confusing how to make money because then you just have to go and play all these games. And the reason why it's hard to make money is because you're looking for permission the mid from midwits inside the Midwit system to make money and and graduate and make more money in the Midwit system, which [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucks because that's just a giant ladder of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupidity for 40 years. And yeah, you can climb up the ladders and do all the things or whatnot, but that's not how money [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] works. It's just how midwits embed themselves in society to make it so that they control the flow of money and then defend themselves in the amount of money that they're make because they at the end of the day they cannot do the one thing that actually makes money which is gain leverage and deliver results. this entire system that I've talked about so far that you have to recognize it first is the reason why making money is not clear and the entire reason for this system is because they cannot do the thing that actually makes money and this my clever little follower you lucky [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] duck is the entire system we're going to skip [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] them we're never going to I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you we're not playing this game [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] these people they're the worst thing on planet earth we're going to cut to the core of it and we're going to do the one thing that they can't do which is get results and leverage and we're not going to ask people when to make money or when we can go up and down in society, we're just going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] take it. And once you understand what I'm about to share with you now, that's how you do it. Now, if you're appreciating the video so far, like, subscribe. I'm going to be delivering all my old courses back when I used to sell courses that taught all my sales methods, everything for free to all my subscribers here at Scoon. I'm going to be able to scrape it with AI. So, you should subscribe, like the video because I can see that. That also being said, no, I don't intend to sell you anything. I mean that for real. There's going to be tons of videos at the end of this video that show you all my business tactics, my sales tactics, my methods for building companies, how I built my software companies. I don't want to sell courses. It's all there for you. No charge. Just just use it. But back on topic, how do we actually go and make money now? What comes from this understanding instead see what you want to do is get straight to the core of what making money actually is and it's results and then leverage you're able to get from those results. This is actually all money is. Let me explain. For example, if I could come into any business in America and I could press a button and that business would instantly make 5% more revenue. Let's say it's a million dollar per year business and they make, I don't know, $50,000 more dollars per year. I could easily charge $10,000 every time I hit that button. Doesn't require what my job title is, how I behave. I could come in probably nude and do it. I could literally say, "Fuck you. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you, Mr. Bigle Bags on the phone when they call me and they'd still pay me. I could [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in my hand, smear it on my body, run through the office playing a harmonica, and as long as I said it's attached to the results I'm going to get them, I can do that. You know why I can do that? Because I have leverage. Especially if I'm the only person that can do that. So, what really people pay money for at the core end of the day is for results and leverage. And if you don't have those things, that's when you have to play the midwit tyranny game because you can't do that. So you have to beg and play this little social hierarchy game that all these retards made because they can't do that. So if we want to make money, what do we want to do? Do we want to go to college? Do we want to play the Midwood game? No. Because that doesn't get results and doesn't give us any leverage. What we want to do is the day from when we are 18 to the day we die is get so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good at certain things that we deliver results and then use those results as leverage to get people to give us money. This applies to you whether you are working a job. This applies to you whether you are an entrepreneur. This applies to you whatever you're doing. For example, let's look at a few situations before we continue on how to actually do this. You look at that developer I mentioned. He made millions of dollars from a month of coding. Why was he able to do this? He was able to deliver that result and we couldn't find anybody else who could. So, we could ask for a percentage of the company. My CTO at Hyros when we were originally building the company, there was no one else who knew how to build what we were building and he was the only one willing to actually put together the team and do it all. So, I didn't have anybody to do that. So, he could ask for a percentage of my company. Now, he's a multi multi multi-millionaire. How was he able to do that? Results and leverage. My company, Hyros, for example, if you put us on a business's ads, they make about 15% more. If the business is making a million dollars per month from their ads, they're going to make a h 100,000 $150,000 more just by fixing their ads using Hyros. What can I do then? I can charge them easily 5 10,000 bucks a month. It's not a problem. It's easy that I can show them the results right there. Why I'm able to do that? Results and leverage. When I was getting out of the military and I needed to make money, not many people knew how to do SEO. So what I do is I sat down for a year and I learned how to do SEO. Then I started doing it for businesses and that's really how I made my first money. And then I landed my first job out of the military doing SEO for a marketing agency and then doing it for clients there without any college degree or experience in any corporate whatchamacallit ever. And I was able to go up there and get it paid a really good salary for that. And the reason for all that was results and leverage. You are going to get paid for results and leverage. So what you want to seek out is being able to deliver results and then leverage them. Shocking. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know. So this seems very vague up until this point. Let me make it not vague. What delivers results? Skills. For example, why does LeBron James get paid $50 million a year or whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he gets paid now in the NBA? Delivers results. You put him on the team, that team makes hundreds and hundreds billions of dollars more. How did he do that? through the ability to get those results by his brand and also his skills in basketball. That gives him leverage to ask unup amounts just to literally have someone put his name on a shoe. Now, let's reduce this down to more common ways. If I wanted to make money as an employee, what should I do? Seek excessive skill in my trade. Don't play the corporate ladder. Don't do any of that stuff. Seek excessive skill and mastery in your trade. If you're an entrepreneur, same exact thing with your product or whatever you're doing. I think you're starting to get that now. But how do we actually go up and attain this if we're a person who doesn't have results and leverage? It's quite easy. It just takes hard work and being consistent, which frankly isn't that hard. Going and doing the Midwit tournament to France for your entire life. That's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard. Like when I worked in an office at the marketing agency, I liked a lot of the people there. It was great. I'm very thankful. Anybody ever watches these videos and knows me? I used to work there. I liked everybody there. It was great. But there's a lot of people just didn't really get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done. like my boss above me in SEO who was there then got fired. It's because he was a Midwood and didn't deliver any results, but he played the Midwood game very very well. But while I was working there, man, that was tough going to the office every single day, playing the the hierarchy game in the office and everything. I mean, the only reason I really survived there because I was I was a poop. I was coming in whenever I want to because I delivered those results and had leverage. But regardless of that, playing the midw hierarchy for your entire life and playing that game and asking for one to make money, terrible. Terrible. much harder work than what I'm about to show you. So, let's just talk about maybe my developer friend I told you made millions of dollars off me. So, when you get into anything, you need to look at what people are looking to do or what result they're looking to achieve, whether it's in business or their personal life. Okay? There's B to C, there's B2B. I prefer operating in the B2B space. I what I try to do in business in my career what I suggest anybody does in their uh even if they're employee is you look at what businesses need. So for example I have a really really amazing head of customer success at Hyros Peter. Now, he started off as a customer success agent and he absolutely mastered being a customer success agent. Then he mastered managing other customer success agents and then learned a ton about churn and customer success and managing teams and lowering churn and uh analyzed the metrics to then lower churn to the point that he had massive leverage at Hyros to get a little bit of equity at our company that's making him a lot of money now. And so what did he did? He he analyzed what our business needed and what's very impactful in the SAS space and he just mastered that. And it took him a couple years to do it. Now he's making really good money doing that. So even if you're an employee, which is fine. Most people watching these videos are going to be employees most of their life. That's fine. You can make lots of money doing it. It's cool. I know a lot of people don't even want to make hundreds of millions of dollars. Maybe if you just made $500,000 million per year, but it's something you enjoy doing that make you happy. This is how you do it. So in B2B, what you want to do is you look at businesses and you look at where there's breakage or there's things that can be radically improved and you get very good at doing that. specifically in the hired positions of of B2B businesses. People don't want their chief executives to just be midwits who do nothing, which is what a lot of companies do. There's a lot of companies out there that are cash driven profit focused. They're not these corporate companies that just have endless revenue. And if you can come in and make the business that's making a million, $2 million per year, 20% more with your effects by, for example, coming in as a head of customer support that's able to lower churn or something like that, they're going to be able to ask for that money. So, what you do is you pick your trade and you just go balls deep into it. Now, what's going to happen in your trades and when you're learning to do these things is it's going to be like a skill tree in World of Warcraft or The Witcher or I I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. You You're a nerd. You know what a skill tree is. You're not out picking up chicks and getting laid or anything like that. You're a little goblin dwelling Dobby from Harry Potter living under the staircase kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You know what a skill tree is. Come on now. So, what you want to do is you want to pick your trade. Okay, so my trade was sales and then I got really good into SAS, building SAS businesses, but pick your trade and just go as deep as you can into it and then look at where the industry is going and where the demand is going to be heading in the future and what's the most cutting edge thing that most people don't know how to do and just learn it. Learn that skill to the point where you're one of the few people to deliver results. If you can do something at a level higher than everybody else and also it's very in demand and nobody else can do it, you are going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money because you have results and leverage. So whatever you're doing out there, whether you're becoming a developer, whether you're working in sales, whether you're going to master customer success, whether you're going to be in web design or design, you need to just go out there and don't focus on going to college and playing the midwit [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game and going up hierarchies and playing systems and roaring about people liking you. just be so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good at something that you have the ability to deliver results and then thus you have leverage. And how do you become really good at that something? You sit down and you just enable every part of your life to focus around that. There's going to be a video linked below here that talks about how to focus in on a skill, master it, and become so damn good at something that you just beat everybody else in it. I will break down exactly how to structure your life and do it and how I did it. It'll make it very, very clear. go below this video, watch that'll be titled improvement [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] video or I don't think I can cuss in the description improvement poo poo poo poo kaka video something like that you you go click it and that will fix this problem that I'm talking about here because that's a whole entire other video but what you need to be thinking the whole moral of this video right here and then the same thing I talked about before applies to doing this for people too for example like my the person that did our our wedding we had to pay her so much money because she's so good at it and like she had leverage and she's like well you know if you're not if you don't want the super wedding that you want. Well, you then go to someone else. She gets paid a lot of money, make weddings. So, again, same exact thing. She her result is the appeal and the Instagramness of the wedding and stuff like that. So, same exact thing. I talk about business, but I don't I don't do weddings for people and I don't do like coaching or anything like that anymore. So, we're not going to talk about that. But the point of this video, coming back to all of this, is when you are sitting around thinking and being confused about money, you need to be thinking to yourself, am I obtaining the ability to deliver results that are unique and then give me leverage. If not, go back to the drawing board, go after those results, and leverage. I don't care what your trader profession is, there is a point where you can get so good at it or get so niche at it or figure out something that nobody else is doing in it just by exploring your craft. Yeah. I don't even if you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] plumber, if you were just like get really into plumbing and get to the point that you can only fix like a certain type of leak or you can create a new type of fix or solution system to something, massive leverage, you're going to be rich. It doesn't matter. You just have to sit down and stop thinking in this midw society system that we live in, which is full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hoops and ladders that are very confusing and more into what is the absolute heart of making money? Result and leverage. So every time you want to make money or get rich in life, think to yourself, am I obtaining the skills that give results and leverage? Now, to focus in on do that, there's a video below that below here called the poo poo kaka video. I also made a video on how to get to your first $100,000 million per year below this video. They're complete. There's no course. There's no gimmick. There's no site to go to. It's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] there. So, enjoy it and away with you. Goodbye.
