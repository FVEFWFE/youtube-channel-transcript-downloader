exactly what was covered in the headline of this video you're going to see exactly how I grew my first business the millions and millions of dollars using email now this being the first time you probably digested anything from this blog I want to cover a few things first this is not some sales pitch BS disguised as content on a blog we're not going to be feeding you this information just pitching you the entire time what I'm be showing you point-blank is how myself and others are going multi-million dollar businesses using email now of course I'm going to be doing this in the market hero system because frankly there's nothing else that I can use to a wise to do this okay so of course I'm a little bit biased when it comes to that but I want you to come to this blog for information I want you to come here for content I want you to come here to learn I want you to expect that so when you get an email from us you're gonna be like oh crap I'm going to learn something amazing about email marketing and growing my business that's what I'm going to focus on here and if at any time you think hey you know market here looks pretty cool there's a free trial on every single page you can check out now I just want to dive straight in the content because I want to make sure this is worth their time respect your time and I want you to lead going like wow that was neato horrific so let's just dive straight into it so you might not know my backstory that's okay it's not like I came out of like a swamp or I don't know group and the Shire and drop the ring of truth into the email marketing volcano okay that's not how it happened but anyways a little bit backstory about me and I'm sorry I'm not a camera right now I'm actually in the Cayman Islands right now and I don't have my camera with me so you just came to deal with mysterious voice Alex but anyways I start a business called source wave about four to five years ago okay it's been a while I don't even remember how long ago we started it I sound really stupid it's point time anyways over the past two years I've really this business up and going to about four to five million dollars a year strictly through email marketing and advertising now what I want to share in this video is exactly how I grew it to that now a little bit background this business you might you know go google so you'd be like this is just a blog what the heck are they some there's a bunch of things we sell from it alright so I saw a lot of software for example here's the software called source machine here's a software called source hunter here's a service provide called source LTS here's another software called source CCS and we also have a university for SEO s as well right here so in short we sell just about anything related to SEO on this business's website but company thing okay you guys it like this guy's sounds like a neat it that's what we do okay and so I'm gonna break down the entire advertising strategy and how I've gone people to buy millions and millions and millions of dollars of all these things okay and I actually want to show you exactly funnel that I use to get people into this and how I make my money back now if you attended the webinar which you probably came in through market hero through that's one of our main sources of advertising if not that's cool too but I'm just going to break down exactly however this company right now I pay about four to five dollars per lead okay I also get thousands of leads directly from the homepage I also get a bunch of leads from other various sources but you need to understand how we grew this business and how we kind of got to the tipping point was we were able to run just mass amounts of advertising now I was able to get leads for three to five dollars that's about the going rate over the past two years now you can see it here when people go through this first funnel right here alone they're worth $8.37 to me okay now this funnel takes place over about three weeks you can see this all lays out right here so here's here's how I grew my business it's so simple I bought leads for less than this number right here that's it I mean like I can break down everything else but that's all I do that's all I do all day long you need to understand that's why market here is so crazy cool though because nothing else will tell me this number right here like that's why I had the system built like I love to be like you can do this and active campaigns or Infusionsoft or anything but you just can't you can't so like I'm sorry do you kind of you know saying you know market here is best but it's only thing lets me do this so I just um I can't I've kind of in a corner now just call me out call he buys you caught me you caught me I like knowing my ROI I like knowing my LTV because this is all my business is about buying leads for less than 8 bucks that means if I go out there and I spend $3,000 a day ok and get leads for 4 bucks in two weeks I'm going to be making 8,000 bucks back okay so the tremendous are why it makes buying my advertising really easy so I'm going to walk you through this funnel and once you kind of picture you should go on Facebook you should go on in the advertising source and see how cheeping get your leads down to if you're on Facebook two to four dollars depending on your niche depending on your offer is pretty normal 90% niches out there I've done leads for two to five dollars allow me to get them for $1 cool now let me going to walk you through what I do right here so I run an ad on Facebook for the 5 and 24 most profitable se niches with super low competition I've run this for years in fact for half this year I ran it with 2015 in the title because I forgot to change this and my ad guy was like you know Alex you should protein to the 2016 I'm like oh I see good catch David good catch high five virtual high five alright so anyways what that happens person clicks here of course we have the opt-in box right here from market hero integrated with leadpages right here person opsin now what then happens is a person goes right here to this Thank You page now look why on earth would I send em to a thank you page instead of trying to sell them something super neat and get them to buy something first off here's why okay you probably heard the statement that you don't want freebie chasers on your email list and buyers so the best best people have an email list so buyer is a person it's bought a product from you they're usually much more likely to buy from you in the future a freebie chase is a person to just opts in the stuff to get free stuff now here's why I don't appear to that I don't believe it okay if you're watching this video I want you to think yourself have you bought anything online ever if you ever use your credit card to buy anything online then you are a buyer whether you are here seeking free content whether you are here because you're you already using market hero you are a buyer okay that that's undisputed there's no such thing as people online that are not buyers everybody has bought something online the difference is there's abundance of people online that don't know about don't know about your brand don't have positive expectations when it comes to your brand so what I do on this video right here is I let people know who I am I tell them I'm going to deliver tons of free value to them I'm gonna give them awesome content like I'm giving you like I'm giving you right now on market here I'm going to over deliver a ton of content that's what I'm telling people is going to happen you can trust me we're going to be sending emails to you of tons of content and the reason why we're giving you all this free stuff there's no catch we just hope that you will check out our software in the future that's why I'm giving you this awesome content right now in market hero because I hope you'll check out market hero in the future that's it I want you to see your emails coming go wow you know that Alex guy delivers a ton of content every single time so I do this and over the next few weeks I send people ton of value to build up a ton of trust and rapport with them that's it that's my only goal right there the reason for that is because I have three goals one I want people to stand my email list I want them to open my emails you can't sell anything if people are jumping off your email list and not opening your emails if people don't have positive expectations and like getting emails for you it's just not going to work too I want to build rapport and Trust okay I want to build rapport and Trust because in order for you to sell stuff to people in order for people to buy high ticket products for me maybe a thousand or two thousand dollars maybe in a product of a thousand bucks a month you have to have rapport and Trust without that there's really no point in selling okay there's no magic sales page there's there's a few out there actually but I can't create magic sales pages they get complete strangers they've never interact with my business to give me a thousand bucks I can however get people to like trust and appreciate my content and know that if they give me money they're going to get something good out of it because my free stuff is this good imagine how much the paid stuff is imagine how great that is now that's number two now number three I want to educate people and create that brand loyalty that makes them not want to use other products and use mine over that okay and that in turn right here is what gets me this tremendous ROI when people are going through my funnel okay that's why because people are more likely to buy from me okay while I don't sell up front people buy much more to me more from me long-term okay and the point of email marketing is getting that long term ROI it's not about making immediate money okay I want a person on my email list to be buying from me not just this month throughout two years from now and there are tons of people like that there one source wave that have been on my email list for literally five years and been buying to me for five years do you know the value of that lead is it's like five hundred dollars okay that's why leads get so so incredible all right now what you understand is when people come in the market here oh this is just the phone right here okay we track them when they come into the funnel right here and we're getting $8.37 but after two months six months actually six months the value of every single person that comes in through any of my opt-ins is about twenty two dollars on average okay so that means if I get a thousand people in that means I make about twenty two thousand dollars from those thousand people every single time like clockwork how do I know this because it's tracked and market here oh it's tracked like clockwork okay now in fact you can actually see a few of my other advertising campaigns I'm going to show you where the person is worth twenty four dollars in the first week can I'm gonna be showing that to you later on in this blog as well just stand our email list I'm just going to give you tons more content like this that's not going to be pitches it's not going to be the old half content I'm going to give you full information and others is a free trial link so whenever you feel like you know stop being skeptical and one who tries for free there it is so let's go through this actual photo right here so a person opsin and they go through and I sort them by tags so what happens in the SEO niche especially is that almost five of the ten people that come through my list are already on my email list okay so I need to have a way to get them off of the new beginners this is what happens when new people come my list I have to kind of nurture them and walk them on so what happens is they get sorted by tag my apply tag called source away veteran right here and then I send them to an offer for unis okay so these are emails right here that go out to them so what happens right here when they our new attack is applied to them that says source wave knew okay and you need to understand one cool thing I'm doing right here is when a person just joins my list I don't want them getting the same marketing messages as everybody else on my list so what happens at the end of this attack called source wave general is applied to them and this removes them from the source wave new list and at the end of the day goes through and makes sure they're not getting the same marketing messages what's really cool right here is when we go through and you look at this first email it's sent out right here what happens is you can actually see I'm making a lot of money just by sending out free value so you can see happens right here people go through and they jump through and they click and get the SEO niches that are going on right here okay so they get a free training from source wave and you can actually see just this free training with the link to our University is actually making a lot of money okay we've actually made about two thousand bucks just right here alone so that's cool that's great now as people go through this what you can see happening right here is I start sending people value-based emails they get a ranking email right here it shows them how to rank their site very quickly and if they don't click this email or if they don't click any email what happens is they get a follow-up email it's the same email with a different headline okay the reason I do that is I want to make sure people get my content-based emails if they're not getting those it really really lessens the power of the pitches that are coming up so I want to make sure they see it so for example I seen this value right here and if they don't glow and click it they don't go and open it what's going to happen right here is they get sent the email again okay so what then happens is I send them a pitch for a product right here you can see a product source hunter right here you can see a few people bought this one right here this pitch didn't actually do so well I need to go actually improve that you can see more people are actually buying on the second pitch right there that being said what happens is a person gets offered a pitch for source hunter right here okay this is a rank tracking program and what then happens is if they buy it they continue down the funnel if they don't buy it they get sent another follow up for that in the form of a free trial or something like that okay now they keep going through the funnel they keep going to the funnel I repeat the value value value pitch us at offer right there what happens when we're closed like a ton of seals is right here with source Unni so a person goes through and what then happens is they go through get more value emails again if they don't open the value emails they get a follow-up email and then we start really hammering them with source Unni okay so at that point in time you got to understand too when people are getting these value emails they're also buying as well that's where a lot of this earning per lead is coming from because even when we send value a lot of cash is being made and so we set them through this value right here and then basically send them source Unni and if they buy source Unni they get kicked out of the funnel and sent to source we've general if they don't buy source you they get offered a free trial so you can see we're kind of reacting based on what people are doing now as soon as they get kicked out of this funnel they usually get hit with a high ticket offer again where a lot of this earning per lead comes from but that's exactly all I do okay that's all I do and what market here makes it so easy to do is say wow you're making eight dollars and thirty cents per lead just buy leads for eight dollars and 30 cents that's it that's all you have to do that's literally all you have to do Alex so this right here is how I grew my first business I just go out there and I send people through this funnel I get this money back and I just buy more leads and that's how generate lists of tens of thousands of SEO s that's it also just a heads up when you join market hero here in a second to the free trial this whole entire funnel will actually be already set up in your account so you can actually just go along and follow in I have everything written out so you can copy exactly what I'm doing the second you get inside you don't even have to draw you know this all out like everybody else has to so check that out that's pretty cool right and back to what we were talking about I wish I could make it more complicated than that but that's that's the power of knowing your LTV and knowing that I know over six months with the tracking side mark here oh I'm making $22 back okay so this is massively massively massively massively profitable for me as long as I'm paying four to five dollars per lead making $22 back in six months so that's what I got for you today well we're actually be hopping into in the next photos how I run the advertising okay I'm going to show you how I buy the ads the advertisements I run and really how I kind of keep the the cost per lead around three to four dollars and then how I go out there and track that we're also going to dive into the exact emails I'm sending in the actual sales pitches that are getting that ROI we're also going go on the webinars we're going all sorts of cool stuff coming up
