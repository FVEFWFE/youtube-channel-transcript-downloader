================================================================================

no you skeptical silly goose the tile this video is not clickbait I'm actually going to give you a six-step script process that I have used for decades at this point since the 80s since before the internet was even created since before I was born this ad script is eternal it's that powerful but on a real note I have used this exact script for almost a decade at this point to print hundreds of millions of dollars online this has worked for me in selling courses and education this has worked for me in e-commerce this currently works for me in SAS I cannot find a better method than this because it's my theory that this is the Baseline of getting a human's attention and convincing them to do anything in a quick period of time there is no process I can come up with no process I've been able to find that makes ads that convert as highly as this and I've just stopped at this point I just literally come to this script every single time I want to create a Facebook Google ad or in these days now Tik Tok ads which makes my skin crawl every time I access that platform interacting with Gen Z gives me AIDS almost every single time I do it but you got to do it they got these days you're going to have to learn how to make Jake Paul your customer if you want to survive in this space but back on topic if we looking for a quick form way to get people to do what we want come to our website and then buy something this cannot be beaten and trust me I've tried hundreds of times I've gotten creative with my ads I've made new types of content I've followed all the hip-hop cool things the cool kids are doing in ads and every single time I come back to this dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's like I have this butter knife that is undefeated in Sword combat and no matter how many crazy things I create lightsabers s samurai swords I don't know something from Final Fantasy this butter knife keeps getting better results and it's annoying because I want to use something fancy and cool you probably to too but this butter knife of advertising cannot be beaten have I talked this up enough good welcome to my channel my name is Alex Becker I have generated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of revenue from ads online and I have one of the largest ad tracking softwares on the entire planet so I can literally tell you what is working across every industry across billions of dollars of AD spend I know it all I'm a genius generational talent I know thank you but on a real note jok's side I sort of have the credentials to tell you exactly what you should be doing right now with ads and as a benefit on this channel I'm an absolute idiot I can't work with processes that are not written in purple crayon so I'm able to break things down for you in a way that's super simple to apply and we'll get results with almost no effort and that's exactly what we're going to do in this video let's hop into this ad script so to kick things off I like to keep these videos super short so after this video there is links in the description and will be popping up in the links after the video that links to videos of these actual ads I mean breaking down these ads so after I teach you how to use the script write you can see it being used in action me breaking it down step by step on top of that a specific ad writing format like word for word is also linked to in this channel as well all completely for free because I'm already rich I don't need to sell you courses or education I simply want you to make more money with your ads and when you do and eventually decide you want to track ads and make much more money from them cuz people that track their ads and see their accurate stats do better that tends to happen you'll eventually come and use hyos my ad tracking software because I've helped you so much with these videos so again take what I'm going to show you in this video then go get the actual step-by-step word for word ad script at the end of it and then watch it applied in action you'll be a ninja within two days in the 2025 by the way happy New Year all right so let's talk about what are we doing here so again the word for word script is linked in the description we'll be at the end of this video I want to give you the theory behind this there are six steps convincing anybody to do whatever you want in a short period of time and what you'll actually find is that convincing someone to do something in a long period of time via a webinar or sales call actually follows this exact format as well but we have to condense this down and AD so let's think about this in a 60-second application which is what we're usually going to be doing with our Facebook Google and Tik Tok ads and by the way I apply the same thing mindset of this to image ads as well it's all the same pattern of persuasion so first things first let's say we're selling anything okay so let's let's narrow it down and get specific let's say we're selling literally anything so the first thing we want to do is attention now this seems stupid and everything I'm going to say is going to sound stupid because it's like kindergarten level simple people don't get it because common sense is missing an advertising it's all over complicated who but everyone gets the basics wrong and it's confused why they suck at this it's like a person who plays basketball but can't make a layup but can shoot three pointers from across the court that's great pal but let's let's just do a little you know second grade layup so attention what is this mean before you even start laying your message on something you have to get someone to stop scrolling on these platforms you have to get them to watch your YouTube ad or at least pay attention to it the first 5 Seconds people see that their eyes glaze over instantly so how do you do this there's a million different ways and you're going to have to experiment with this the first thing you just need to think on is like what will grab their attention you can literally make this the first one second of any AD and then split test it across all your ads you just interject this at the start of the video so what's going to grab a person's attention I'm going to give you a a funny little just quick example of this at hyos 90% of our customers are dudes they're all dudes running businesses regardless if they're doing e-commerce businesses SAS businesses info businesses doesn't matter you know what dudes like pretty girls so what we did is in our ugc videos where we had people giving testimonials our ads where we had people talking about the videos we just interjected any testimonials or speaker SL Avatar that was an attractive woman in the first 5 Seconds video that's just what we started off with so the ad starts with testimonials and the testimonials are introduced by a pretty woman just literally someone saying you got to see these testimonials at hyrus or something like that pay a person on five or five bucks to do it they'll do it boom the ad gets attention now there's all sorts of ways I've seen this Ed so for example I saw like a protein powder and the way they were squeezing out the protein powder had it in a way to it look like poop and it was like in a bathroom so people were like what what the heck am I watching and then they zoom out and it's protein powder and it's not a bathroom at all so they're like oh I I shouldn't be having those dirty thoughts or I've seen ones where they have like a food item or something and it's shaped in like a slightly phallic way or inappropriate way I'm using extreme examples here yes I am suggesting make your your product look like a penis in your ads to catch people's attention I'm not suggesting you do that but I'm using extreme examples here so you understand what your first thought should be it shouldn't be pitching your product or even hooking them with the exal missions it needs to be to get them to stop scrolling uh I've seen various ones where people are selling products about losing weight and they make uh they took a bunch of eggs like rotten eggs that look like fat cells and they have this at the first 5 Seconds of their video or they have something weird or gross playing at the beginning of the video think about that at the start of your videos I'm not saying put something gross or doesn't align with your brand in the first five seconds of your video I'm saying get something that's going to get someone to stop scrolling it can be as simple as a pretty face it can be as simple as something that's kind of gross or it can be something that makes people go hm what like for example I saw one ad where they had like five tall guys line up to like five really short guys and it said like the secrets in their spine and that makes no sense like you're like but you're thinking what's going off these tall guys versus these short guys it makes you stop scrolling and then what we can do is we have to figure out what is important to the user in the ad because this is where we're going to hook them okay so again you got to follow this process when making the ad and again the process the step byep is in the other video after this we want to think about these questions so we can then apply it to the next video script that you're going to get here so what's important to the person that's going to get them to actually take action so it depends on how you're communicating with the customer and what's going to trigger them it can sometimes be pain it can sometimes be gain let me give you two examples of this so if you're like in a Big Industry where it's really generic and you're selling Apples to Apples you have to find something to differentiate your product across other products so for example um what I've seen in the gym clothing space right now is obviously stuff that has polyester in it is bad for your balls or something it gives you Plastics so I've seen Brands using the pain of like hey your shorts are poisoning you and giving you cancer or something like that that's a pain that's going to trigger someone to click if that's important to them targeting these specific people comes down to audience targeting which is also talked about in this channel but you think about that like what's the big one single pain we don't want to list 10 different things we just want to know one big thing or for example in the make money online space when I used to sell courses there the game was always blatantly like make money and we have to tie it in with step three so sometimes it can be just a very simp simple gain from it or a simple offer of gain I really like pain-based ones so for example what works really well at hyos that's going to be most important to the customer is either making more from their ad revenue or not losing tons of money but depends on the C we're marketing to so for example for marketing to a business owner that is not really involved with their ads talking about gain like hey this will instantly make 15% more revenue from your ads which again we're not just pulling that out of our butt if you look at hyos that's why Tony Robbins Alex pudgy Penguins Playboy and 4,000 plus other businesses users we literally guarantee when you plug in h you make 10 15 20% more on the low end from your ads because if you just track ads with accurate tracking you make better decisions your ads make more I'm not joking you can see all the results on the site Google hyos after this you should be using it I'm not going to push hos anymore because we want to get into content but again if you run ads without hus you factually choosing to like make less money and that's our actual pitch in a business owner will stop CU that's what's important to them but if we're talking to someone who's running ads the pain works a lot better so for example we'll talk about how they're not able to see what their ads are generating uh that there's crisscrossing between their ads they're missing sales and so I kind of run ads from both of these angles to get both of these different parties because sometimes we're managing our marketing to add managers and other times we're marketing the business owners so think about what's most important and how you can introduce it to them three this is an optional one but very important with Industries where you're coming in from gain perspectives because everybody uses the same gain if we're talking about something like make money online the reason you're going to stand out on your ad is this step right here what's the thing or bad experience they had in the past so without and or bad experience in the past so for example in the make money online Niche this is this is so important to step number two because everybody's offering a person to make money rich and fast and quickly and whatever okay and also everybody offering it everybody hates and so you have to consider that people have had bad experiences in the make money on life like hey do you want to make money for real without having to invest money up front without a bunch of complicated hoopla something that's really beginner friendly so without and you're addressing all the crap they've had to deal with in the past or for example at hyos when we offer these big gains right here we throw in without making changes to your business and you have to consider the step optional so for example if I was doing with the the clothing example I did before we're talking about polyester giving everybody plastic in their balls um you don't really need to have this without okay because we've already really triggered a lot of pain but a lot of times gain is not good enough to just trigger people alone you need to also throw in them without and so consider that when you're building your ads and scripting them now step number four is we need to be able to verify it okay so let's imagine someone comes up in the street and tells you or first off catches your attention by poking your nose okay it has to be something that grabs your attention might probably scare you on the street but let's imagine a person come up to you and pokes your nose and then what you're going to do is you're going to offer some potential gain without something that they hate or without a bad experience they've had in the past or offer an escape from a pain you usually don't have to do the without part if you're offering or the most important thing is pain and then you have to verify it so how do we verify this how do we get the person to believe us this is the most important thing like what's the most important thing that if you had would really improve their life and that they would immediately respond to if you truly had if you can create something like that then all you have to do is prove the person at works so how do you verify it well there's testimonials of course studies what I find is best is famous people suggesting your product which I talk about in another video on this channel it's the trt ads video and it's basically how I use testimonials to then get famous people to promote our proess how we got for example like Tony Robbins clickfunnels Grant Cardone all those companies and AD managers of those companies to suggest our product that's how we did it if you're curious how that happens but what you want to focus on is things like this you have to find a way to believably verify if you just tell people hey my prodct will increase your ad Revenue by 15% it's not going to work but if you show them testimonials or for example let's say we're talking about that uh e-commerce example with the gym shorts if we show studies on how polyester is increasing it and how studies with our prodct or something show a different result for example Quia one of the best selling neut Tropic products in the uh neut Tropic space or brain Improvement biohacking space they had tons of studies to back up what they were saying or in red light therapy or uh saunas they they would they show these studies and these examples of how it's actually increasing longevity and whatnot very very very super duper important and so the best things you can do is test but the best things in my opinion are testimonials from famous people backed with studies if you're in some kind of uh particularly in e-commerce Niche who do they trust and what information can you get them that is believable and not for you to verify this point right here and at this point you have the person hooked enough to get them to like take action and so step number five is there just has to be a time sensitive reason for them to click and take action now all right so for example at hyos all the time I don't like to use too much gimmicky time stuff um it's just not great for a SAS brand what I'll use sometimes in specials of course the price is increasing soon or something like that what I like to do is I just like to point out all the money that they're losing every single day uh when not using the product so for example they're spending 100,000 a month on ads they could be making an extra 10 20,000 a month if they just use hyros and it's like I don't know $300 $500 a day they're losing just by not using it in e-commerce though or especially in infom marketing where you can kind of be a little bit of a sleev bag you can come up with all sorts of stuff like time sensitive discounts fake scarcity I know you mother all you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are using fake scarcity you guys are turd we might as well just talk about what you're doing uh webinars where you act like it's time sensitive all sorts of anything just be creative you if you've been in an industry and you're running ads for any amount of time you know every type of form of scarcity there is at the end of your videos have some reason to click right now and then tell them to click you need to tell them to click multiple times when you check out the script that end the video we'll talk about that and finally you have to create the downside okay like what what's going to happen if you don't click and you don't take action out like what's the worst case scenario so for example at hyos I'll talk about how we have this crazy guarantee that they get this result so the only downside to taking action on this ad right now and trying hos would be it not working the upside is you make so much more money without making any changes in your business the downside click this video now we're offering these shorts that don't give you your your your balls cancer and during the month of January actually the next week we have a special discount to people buying their first pair of pant or something like that they come to the page there's timers whatnot and we have a crazy guarantee or every single day you're wearing normal shorts you're poisoning your body a little bit more which is the opposite of why you're going to the gym in the first place and so what we're doing there uh is we're giving them a reason to click now and I'm making their other pants that they're wearing very very uncomfortable so to recap everything we've done right here the verbatim word for word what to say is in the video after this video but what we've done is we've grabbed their attention but by not focusing on any of this message right here a lot of people start focusing on uh this this very poorly drawn uh training right here again we're going to keep the quality super low this year as always I know you guys love it let's keep the professionalism just at dirt bag levels but we don't want to focus on any of this right here below a lot of people focus exclusively on this in their ad without grabbing attention properly and so again you have to consider that if we can just double the amount of people that stop scrolling so let's imagine before had 25% of people stop scrolling we get to 50% by putting something that looks like a dick in our ads I don't know but think about it and crazy ways to catch attention and then split test it if we do that that's just going to double the volume of our ad instantly this is the most important thing right here if we want quick easy no effort results then we focus on what is most important to the person that they would pay for if we had step three if it's a gain benefit you have to remove the things that have stopped them from pursuing that gain in the past and then verify it using these three things right here scientific studies and testimonal from famous people being the most powerful or doing some separate kind of case study yourself for example if you have 5,000 customers track literally the average rate that customers uh succeed at your business for example at school one really good thing that horoi and ovens did with their ad is they pointed out that like on average a user makes $1,200 when they open their school so like that was like across every single thousands of people that use it that's the average that's pretty impressive you want to use undeniable numbers like that studies Etc so then you want to give them a reason to click now and a downside if they don't click whether it's increasing the amount of counts there in their balls or the amount of money that they're losing every single day and that there's no risk at clicking if they come and try hyros or whatever your product is or something like that having extremely powerful guarantees in your business last little tip is one of the greatest ad you can never do and and for your business and your product should work 100% of the time or people shouldn't pay for it so you might as well just have a crazy guarantee in the first place you're not going to grow business by keeping the money of angry people it'll work for like a year and then the angry people build up into a horde of people with pitchforks and then come tear down your business and tell everyone you suck and then it's over at that point so having crazy guarantees is a really good way to get people to click ads and buy and do everything else you want because again there's no risk to them and the reason why people don't buy things is there's risk so this is what I've used this is the format and questions I go through whenever I write an ad in fact whenever I communicate with people at this point in any form of sales process or day-to-day life or even videos this is the process I've Ed you might notice I start my videos with craziness a lot of times if you ever watch my crypto Channel or this channel why do I do that attention what's the second thing I do what's important to you why are you here your ads making more money and how frustrated you are with losing money on your ads and the fact you want to grow your ads without effort and then what I do next I verify I verify and then instead of getting you to click an ad here I just give you the damn content because that's what you're here for what I want you to do is consume the content but I literally use this exact sales process to the start of this video to get you to my goal which my goal was for you to consume the content and enjoy the content in this channel more because once you do that I can slowly brainwash you into properly tracking your ads and not losing tons of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money needlessly from your ads eventually you'll come around if I lather you up sudge you up with enough quality content Jokes Aside though this is the process you use watch the videos right after this video the exact word for word script and then the examples of ads of me doing this step by step like we we'll watch a video over the shoulder of me going through that video ad that's made Millions tens of millions of dollars we'll do that as well and it'll be linked to you right after this subscribe to this channel I'm going to be posting videos about once a week going into 2025 and like always I have a wonderfully awkward exit outro for you
