================================================================================

in this video I'm going to show you the best funnel strategy for Facebook and YouTube ads I'm not kidding I've been applying this to my funnels for years I've had one funnel on Facebook and YouTube ads over $20 million in sales my current funnel is scaled High RIS to being the fastest growing ad analytics company in the entire world right now it works really really really well and I have multiple friends whove used this exact strategy have done over 50 million 20 million 30 million big numbers everywhere shoot the fireworks off okay it works period if you apply this to your ads you're going to see much much much much better results and I barely know anybody that has had massive success without this and I know hundreds hundreds of people that are mediocre at Facebook and YouTube ads that just completely ignore this Rule and they will be forever until they appreciate this rule the whoopings and wasted ad spend will continue until you do this have I sold this well enough okay great real quick my name is Alex Becker I'm the CE of hyros ran a lot of ads I've made a lot of money from ads understand the ads pretty well and I have access to the entire data from across the entire industry so I can tell you exactly what is going to work with your ads on Facebook YouTube and everywhere else and what's not going to work I also have the best ad Mastermind on planet earth based on results I have more 6 seven eight figure results than any other AD Mastermind online right now so again I see what works I see what doesn't and on these videos I tell you what does and doesn't and that's exactly what we're going to do here so let me break down the strategy before we get start here's the number one thing you need to understand about ads that very few people grasp I see people do when they start hitting scale resistance with their ads is they make different funnels and different ads so the most common mistake I see that is going to stop you from ever ever ever having a world class funnel and a funnel that can scale to the Moon from your ads is you're going to go and I see people get to let's say I don't know $2,000 a day and they stop being able to generate a profit so what they think to themselves is oh what I need to do is I need to make another funnel and another funnel and so if this one right here makes let's just I know these are big numbers for some people let's just use them in in context with whatever numbers you're doing this fun right here makes $4,000 a day back here s of 2x Roi their logic is I'll make another one and then I'll make another one and I'll make another offer and I'll make another weird funnel that goes in this off right here I'm going to try all these different ways to scale by adding different offers and different entry funnels to this this is the dumbest thing you can ever do inight of ads it's the number one reason why people do not have success with ads and why they cannot scale okay if you've ever hit a point where you just keep getting resistance and you keep making new funnels this is exactly why in order for an ad to work it has to be profitable duh okay but in order for an ad to work at scale it has to be profitable at scale these are this is such a stupid duh statement like of course I get that Alex but here's what you're not understanding in order for an ad to be profitable at scale I don't know how I'm explaining this the ad has to be phenomenal the funnel the offer and the ad have to be on effing point and the only way to get an ad in a funnel on point on effing point is to spend a crazy amount of time on them and optimize them to the zillionth degree okay so for example when I was running hcom I scaled that to over $20 million in sales $25,000 End Sales a level most people won't ever get to I'm not saying I'm the greatest I'm saying I've gone to a level that a lot of people pursued getting to that's what I'm saying so that funnel had to be rebuilt that offer the pitch the ads everything had to be redone many many many many many times at least seven times the funnel broke down stopped working as we started scaling it up or we were at scale and it would just slowly fall apart and go down during this time period I saw competitors and people trying to mimic me they'd make new funnels for their product they'd make a a book funnel they'd make this funnel they'd make that funnel they never caught up when I just kept working on the same damn funnel why is this well it's very simple when you're running ads you're running ads against other people's funnels okay so let's imagine we're running a YouTube ad right here well guess what we got funnel number a uh from let's just tell let's just keep it simple we got it that from business a business B business C Business D and then imagine we go all the way down the alphabet because everybody's trying to run a funnel if you're in a niche that's even slightly competitive there's probably like 10 other people 15 20 100 other people trying to run ads for your same Niche so the way you pull ahead and win at ads is you have to actively beat other people you have to be able to get a better Roi from your ads than other people because if they can get a better Roi they will out bid you for example if you make $2 for uh every dollar you spend well guess what if you have a competitor that makes $5 for every dollar he spends he's simply going to start increasing his bids until it's until you're at a point where you make $2 for every $2 you make he's going to increase the bid where he doesn't have to spend a dollar anymore to get a lead he'll spend $2 to get a lead so if you for example again I'm explaining this very poorly just let me dumb this down even more let's say you spend $1 to get a lead and you make back he spends $1 to get a lead he makes $5 back well he's just going to increase the bid till it's $2 per lead so he can get more of the leads that's simply what that's how the bidding algorithm works it goes to a win or take all and so in order for your funnel to scale to the next point you have to get to the point where your funnel makes a better Roi than any other funnel that you're competing against or at least a better Roi than 95 90% of them if you're in that lower 10% you just get out bid that's how this animal take eat what dog eat dog ad game works and so only way to make sure your funnel wins and the only true way to scale is to have a dominant funnel if you have a dominant funnel you can scale it to $100 million I know multiple people multiple people who have done 20 50 hundred million plus in sales in Revenue they only had one main entry funnel what how did they do this is it's because they're funnel one and beat all the other funnels when you have a funnel that beats every other funnel you don't need any other funnels you can just scale that one to the Moon because you can spend more than other people and when you spend more on other people eventually what happens is you got the entire range of people who get an Roi in their funnel and once you get to the point where you're the king of the castle right here you just Escape you you escape this threshold right here where you really don't have any competitors when it comes to ads and then your ad just takes off because there's no one else left buying traffic at that price and so if you're making a lot of our Y at that price guess what you you got it that's that's the biggest key to funnels on here so the number one thing I can teach you of all things is you want to make one funnel to rule them all in your business one entry point funnel okay your your business should never ever I'm just going to give you tip number two your business never ever ever should just be one funnel and ads and going to a prog that's the silliest thing on planet Earth you should have funnels so people can enter your business and then they come into your business and they buy more things later on okay or they come back and buy it because they have a good experience with the funnel at the start but until your business is doing 1020 million per year I really don't see much use for having five or six different ad base entry funnels I just don't maybe you can have retargeting funnels in the back end and go to your existing customers but there's no point to have one more than one entry funnel because that thing can just be super optimized to work and generate customers better than anything else so what makes a great entry funnel first off it's easy and simple seriously all right I cannot tell you how many people I I I am the CEO of hrus I I can see what's working across the industry and what's not I cannot tell you how many people I know that are making crazy amounts of money and they just have a basic call or webinar funnel or uh High ticket sales video funnel I can't tell you I can't tell you the numbers are endless and I can I cannot also name to you how many people who have impressive stats with complicated funnels whether it's a book funnel whether it's like a weird survey funnel it's an up or down funnel where they do a handstand I'm sure you've seen all of them upsell down cell wazu funnel they're all a mess why because when you have tons of moving Parts when you have tons of moving connections when you need to get really high conversions on a low ticket product or something like that there's so many different moving parts to optimize and each part of the funnel is its own Beast to optimize so if I have a call funnel which is very very basic okay let's just look at let's just look at the hyros ad for example all right our ads go straight to a page where a person just books a call okay and then let's look at all the moving parts of that funnel just from this simple basic funnel all right we got the ad itself okay we got the landing page okay we got the book A call Page all right which I'm just going to put a square around it then we have the follow-up process of the call they get them on the there we got the pitch itself on the call uh and then we got the offer okay that's a lot of moving parts to optimize I can spend all day just optimizing the ads I can spend all day optimizing this part I can spend all day optimizing this part and this part the pitch itself working with the sales team the offer that's more than I could possibly wrap my damn head around that is that is a full-time thought process right here the SEC this is enough to completely overwhelm my mental capacity maybe you're a genius I'm not and I don't even know if I got this all drawn up correctly okay cool yeah it's all focused in the frame great see I can't even run this damn presentation effectively if we just 2x this this is something my brain can't even optimize or comprehend if we if I were to make another call funnel or like a webinar funnel on top of this or like a book funnel no if this strategy required me to sell like a book and then have a downsell number one down sell number two and like three to four different sales videos no I couldn't do it it's just too damn much information to optimize it's too many buttons and toggles optimized because every little thing affects every other thing on here okay so that's why when you see some of the most successful funnels of all time Sam Vin's webinar funnel very basic it's just a webinar that's it sells $2,000 Pro build his entire business around that one webinar funnel you go look at the initial funnel that took off clickfunnels just a webinar funnel go look at alexos funnel that did like 50 hundred million sales just a pitch funnel you look at almost any agency or e-commerce business they usually just have one funnel where everybody gets in at now of course as businesses get bigger you can have a marketing team you have different entry points you could be expanding in the different markets let's say uh for example I want to expand hyros to focus on agencies okay of course I could have a different agency funnel to Target a different type of customer but a lot of people have multiple different funnels for the same type of customer our customers are extremely similar that's wonky that's craziness and you should focus on maxing out that particular customer which again if if your business can't get the $10 million a year on one particular type of customer you're kind of picking the wrong Niche okay so then what's the next thing we really want to focus on all right well one thing I would suggest just to make things simple make it high ticket whatever whatever is in your industry for example I see people with e-commerce funnels where they're selling like a $47 product or something wrong with there it's way easier if you just sell like a $300 product I've seen people bundle information and and a a bundle of all their products together to make it high ticket why is this easier because with lower conversion rates your numbers will work out better I've talked about this a billion times on a channel go watch the other trainings we have a full YouTube course a full Facebook course full courses on literally everything on this channel when it comes to ads this just works better because just from a basic Roi all right it's a lot easier to get a 2 to 1% conversion on a high ticket product and it is to get a 7 to 10% conversion on a $47 product so we just put in basic math right here okay uh let's say we're paying $10 per lead and we get a th000 people in okay that's 10K okayy and we can get 10% of the convert on a $550 product okay so we get 100 people we just made $5,000 we're not making our money back right there we get a th000 people in and we get 1% of them we get 10% of them to convert on a 1K product or so 1% 1K product we just made our bunny back we just covered our ad cost the numbers simply work by default a lot better okay this is what you're going to see across the board across every industry another insanely useful tip I'm going to give you is find ways to connect with the customers in person on ad funnels why is this because if you can get a person on the phone or in a chat you can convert them to much higher products because you can sell them something something specific to them for example at hyos you know we survive because we have really high ticket products because we can sell people a customized solution that works for them okay this is why having some type of product that is designed for ads you want to sit back and this is the best advice I can also give you in a funnel is think about how you can make a funnel and offer with ads in mind not how you can make a funnel and offer or an offer and then find a way to make a funnel an ad that works for it so what does that mean don't make your offer first make the ads and think about what offer would be best for ads and then make the offer around the ads not the other way around because then when you're trying to match ads to your offer it doesn't always work together right not all not all offers are great with ads and it leads to the final Point use ad funnels not as your core business okay not as your core business you can and it makes it even simpler for example we only have one damn product at hyos we just have one but sometimes in businesses the best thing you can possibly do is use your ad funnel as an entry point so for example uh when I had my info funnel hcom I'd use as an entry point for my SAS business so people would buy this product right here and it would cover ad costs and it would allow me to then sell people a recurrent subscription at my other business for $99 to $500 a month okay so it allowed me to get people in for free to my business and then build a very large reoccurring income with this this is how you want to think about it think think about how your entry funnel sets up the rest of your business so for example the reason why clickfunnels sells information marketing on their front end while all their ads sell information marketing and not really clickfunnels it's because that covers ad costs and gets people into the business Russell then sells you a book or whatever else is going on that funnel I personally think that funnel is overly complicated but don't pat my you know click funnel is doing all right so just we'll leave it at that but you can see he sells a ton of stuff on the front end and indoctrinates and gets people in the you can you can create an infom marketing business you can sell courses online you can do whatever that you know they're doing over there and then they sell click phones in the back end which is where they make the huge reoccurring subscription fees okay the funnel sells products that are optimized for ads to cover ad cost they cover all the money that they spent on ads right here and they get tons of customers in for free then they sell them the reoccurring product and they're able to Market to the customer much cheaper through retargeting ads email marketing and their communities once they get a person in from this point of the direction right here so again very simple let's imagine we spend 10K in ads well they make 10K back from their info procs which are optimized to be sold for ads it's way easier to make money in your money back selling info procs than it's like a a reoccurring software it's nearly impossible to sell subscription software and make money on your ads it's it's in incredibly hard to do I've never seen it I haven't seen it done in years there might be someone I don't know who it is but you're not going to make front-end money whereas you run an ad and and it suddenly pumps out a 2xr same day but what they do out here is they do this and then when people come in here they make their money back however the person becomes an optimal customer that they can End Market to very easily whether they buy or not because they see the funnel they get to know brussell they get to know what click phones is all about then they can be retargeted sold to much cheaply much cheaper they can be marketed to on their email list and the person's probably going to join their communities which allows them to get them in the other thing pretty much for free so this cost money right here but the money the customer is for free and then they get them on a $99 subscription it's $1,000 per year and they gain $1,000 per year customer for free that's that's the funnel strategy that works okay so all these techniques right here one have one funnel two make the funnel easy to understand and operate three preferably make the funnel High ticket best way you can also do this is by finding ways to talk to the customers one-on-one as much as possible that allows you to sell them things that are much more expensive okay a much more expensive info product a much more expensive bundle yada yada y yada okay three or four make sure the funnel sets up the rest of the business what does it communicate to the customer how does your brand appear I see people try way too hard also to sell their front end prodcts and it burns out the customer before they get into the back of the business and this is truly where every business makes the tens of millions of dollars it's all in the back end the 10 millions of tens of millions of dollars in profit all right people make make all sorts of Revenue on their front end but until you separate that ad cost you can actually get people into your community and your actual funnels where you're not paying an arm and a leg to talk to them each time it's really going to be hard to make those juicy profit margins so guys that is the lesson for today realiz I put on a huie hoodie mid video that's the listen for the day guys if if you want to see how to grow your ads a lot more
