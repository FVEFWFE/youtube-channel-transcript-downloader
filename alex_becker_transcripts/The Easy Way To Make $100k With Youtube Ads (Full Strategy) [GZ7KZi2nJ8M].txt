you ever thought to yourself i wish there was a guaranteed way that my ads would make money i wish there was an ad strategy where i could just plug it in and it would print money like the government or oprah or taylor swift she is great at printing money her ad her median buying skills out of control well i'm going to share that with you today this is alex becker i'm ceo of hiros coming to you in some sweet high risk merch because this is really the only form of clothing that i actually own and the strategy i'm going to show you with youtube ads today it's not gonna make you 10 million dollars it could actually make you a million dollars it is it just works it's so stupidly easy to pull off and the ad source that you're going to be targeting pretty much guarantees and roi why because we're going to be targeting people that have already watched our videos we can use youtube videos to be a custom audience machine for facebook and youtube and if you understand how to then target these these customs if you understand how to target these custom audiences it's virtually a guaranteed roi the people i've taught this method to and when i've used this on uh this channel i'm totally not doing it on this channel link am i winking right i can't wink really quickly but i'm totally not doing it on this channel but if you use this on your youtube channels it is so easy to get a 1015xr why did it it's almost you should just do this by default so let me show you how it works and really quickly as you're watching this video you're thinking hey you know i would actually like to hop on a call with this guy and have him tell me exactly how to run my ads and my strategies you should book a call below because we can do that it's neat let's get going all right guys the first thing you understand is why most cold ads don't work and cold ads are simply when you're running to an ad or you're running an ad to someone who's never seen you before obviously there's a lot of disadvantage the person doesn't trust you they don't know you if they've never seen you before and a lot of times they aren't even your target demographic because your targeting is kind of a little bit more broad than it needs to be specifically on youtube this leads to a trifecta of hard now i'm not saying cold ads can't work on youtube i've scaled campaigns to over 10 million dollars a year on youtube 90 actually like 95 percent cold traffic it's just hard so look if you're a person that just wants extra money from your business or you just want an easy way to get started with ads this is just perfect for you so here's exactly what you do you make videos on youtube about the topic that you're selling about for example i'll just be straight with you i'm doing this a hundred percent on this channel and it works like crazy it is free money what you do is you make videos about whatever your topic is so if like you're a makeup artist or something you make videos doing makeup then what we do is we can easily go in to the youtube ad manager and then target people that watch our channel it's that easy it's that simple more importantly in your videos you can then also go and leave links in the videos when people click these links you can use this to make a facebook custom audience so what are these people well they're the definition of easy to market to because unlike cold traffic once they watch your video they go to warm in the best way possible one they've already consumed content to from you two they're your target market three they're actively watching and consuming these types of videos on youtube okay you put this all together you have a badly drawn easy metaphor so how exactly do you do this it's quite quite simple my young padawan and one thing i also want to point out right here is i can also make similar audiences to people watching these videos so for example here's a similar audience right here we created from this this is just people very similar that watch my channel you can see uh 10 000 in 26 000 profit out that's cool that's an extra i know with the rate we're running at right here that's an extra couple hundred thousand a year for just really making youtube videos on your channel so how exactly do we do this quite easy you're gonna come up here to tools and settings in your admin you're gonna go to audience manager and what you're going to do is you're going to hit add youtube users okay you're going to need to connect your youtube channel to adwords first i'm just going to name this one doozy mcsnoozy drinks too much boozy okay and boozy all right we're not gonna spell right in this video so we're gonna do is viewed any video from a channel or just viewed the channel okay so we can do viewed certain videos for example uh as well so for example if i made a video talking about let's say i was teaching bowling techniques and in one video i was talking about bowling gloves in specific then i could make an audience of people that are literally just watching the bowling gloves video and then sell them bowling gloves okay so i'm just do anybody that viewed my channel but the concept is the same way what i suggest you do at this point is you would probably want to use the last 30 days and i would make multiple audiences i'd make people that have watched in the last seven days 30 days 90 days and if you want to be tedious as hell 540 days and so this is going to give us a total audience of everyone's viewed the channel everyone that's recently viewed the channel and everyone who's mid-term viewed the channel obviously the people that just watched the videos your magic secret goose if you want the roi is going to be in the seven days area right here that's almost it and then what you want to do is you want to run ads to whatever you're selling in the first place the reason why i wanted to show you this very quickly guys is because i see so many influencers and people that don't have you know not mr beast okay your videos aren't making you aren't getting 40 million views of video however you are getting decent views on your videos 500 to 5 000 views a video plus if you're not doing this you're literally refusing free money because it costs you literally nothing to advertise to these people and the roi is so high it's very hard not to make money from your current subscribers or viewers to put this even in more perspective you can go and get people that have subscribed to your videos if you want an even higher roi or you can even do people that have liked videos these are people that not only watch your videos but liked it again you need to learn how to do cold traffic and scale your ads and if you want to do that there's literally an entire free youtube course on this channel that shows you how i skilled an ad campaign to 25 000 per day you can also book a call with me below and i'll break down everything you need to be doing on youtube ads and facebook ads that being said you need to learn how to do cold traffic because if you want to get really in the big bucks and scale a business this is this is a lot slower than i think it could it needs to be mastering cold traffic is the way to go that being said if you're just starting off in ads using this to go and generate your custom audiences on youtube and then using people that click on the links to your videos to create custom audiences on facebook they just land on the page you create a look-alike audience and a visit audience on facebook it's just such an easy way to run ads you can also go i'll show you to create a similar audience once you create this audience right here what you're going to see is you're going to see youtube automatically create these similar audiences okay so these are old ones right here so they're empty but you're going to see something very very very similar to this pop up in there as soon as you create these audiences and then that will start to grow as well you're probably going to need a couple thousand people for it to go and create this similar lines but you saw the results i got before with it and this is by far the easiest way to run ads on youtube that are profitable that's it concluding the video guys if you want to actually hop on a call with me where i break down a strategy for you and how you should actually be running your business specifically on youtube because your unique snowflake go below and book a call on top of that you need to notice one thing right here i am literally not using adwords stats when i'm going and optimizing my ads i go off hiro stats this is accurate data especially after the last ios crash that just happened it's knocking out facebook and youtube's data i go and see the things that facebook and youtube can't report on and then we plug this back into their systems to make it better but more importantly you can see i'm actually optimizing around profit and then the actual calls that came in for example youtube just caught 25 calls right here it can't even catch the profit since these calls are closed over the phone iros can if you're not optimizing around accurate data and your actual profit you're optimizing around some really weird stats if you're not optimizing for profit like literally most people are what are you doing so this has been becker check out all the free courses at the bottom of this video
