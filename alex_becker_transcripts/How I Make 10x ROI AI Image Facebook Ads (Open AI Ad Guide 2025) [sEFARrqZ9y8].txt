================================================================================

so AI image generation has changed everything this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen and it's cut our cost to get calls and customers and sales down literally 50% at hyos and some of the other businesses I run it's insane and in this video I want to show you my image ad flow that I'm using to just just fart noises are the sounds of saving money by the way I don't know if you know that but this is what they are look this image flow that I have right here has allowed me to pump out so much really highlevel image ad creative you can see just the screen will get flooded with all of them right now this is what I just made like this morning in like 30 minutes it's insane and being able to replace creative this fast and Test new creative and make new creative this quickly has allowed me to just I can't make enough fart noises at you today the cost per sale is just plummeted and so what I want to show you today is my flow for creating these image ads so you can go do it yourself now if you don't know which you probably don't cuz I don't talk about my other companies other than High I have an image generation company and I've been on The Cutting Edge of this stuff for a while and you're probably thinking AI is a little bit scary not anymore the past week it's finally up to the point we're in the singularity point and anybody can come and apply this right now and start making just Oodles of improvements to their ads you like literally it's insane it's night and day what you can do with your advertising so I want to show you how I'm making these images now because in the past I've been making images with the AI and whatnot but you have to install stuff locally on your computer you have to generate models you have to train faces it doesn't always come out exactly right it's just not very effective for ads not anymore you can just L throw crap at the wall and it works amazingly well so I'm just going to teach you this 100% for free I don't have some Mastermind or anything to sell you all I want to do on this channel is teach you everything I know about advertising so that your ad sh money make you a lot more money and then when you're making a lot more money you're going to think to yourself I'd like to make more money and spend less money on ads to make more money and get more customer cheaper that's when you're probably going to use my tracking company hyros which pretty much everyone on planet Earth with a big name is using thousand and thousands of customers use it because if you plug this tracking into your ads you're going to get the accurate data see where all your sales are coming from to a te it tracks 340 50% more sales than Facebook ads Google ads whatever ad platform tracking you're using and that's going to make you at least 15% more on your ads or you literally don't pay for it I'm not joking come check out hus after this if your ads do not improve like all these freaking crazy amounts of people and people you know they're on the screen right now you don't pay for it so come check it out after it'll make your ad so much more money now let's talk about these image ads let's just with the absolute Basics here in chat gbt and I want to just show you flows now the cool thing about this is it's just it's made this so simple what I'm going to be showing you later on is how I actually use this uh locally in my own stable diffusion to create all sorts of cool images of myself and stuff like that I'm going to show you some advanced stuff but that's stuff that really isn't accessible to most people especially if you're new to AI image creation it's just not going to be um something you're going to be starting off with but now with chat GB BT it's so easy to do a lot of the basics here and this is going to get you 95% of the way there I'm going to show you the other stuff that's going to put you above everybody else at the end of this video though so let's just go over the basics right here if you haven't seen this using chat GPT to create images is crazy now we're going to be using a lot of my crypto content and if you ever been to my crypto side of my my content online it's it's just about the worst thing ever I apologize this is actually just a clone of me this is my evil stepbrother the person in those videos and and saying all those Terrible Things definitely not me so do not pay attention to that but you're going to see I'm using this a lot for my YouTube and creative and promotional side um of mar crypto related stuff too but I'm going to show you this primarily for use and ads that's the focus of this video so just to go over the basis right you can see I just threw a picture of myself in here please remake this image in studio gibly style okay so it just goes and makes a picture of myself right here now when you're using these commands you can see that you're going to need to a lot of times really keep chat gbt and guidelines you can see how it goes and made this iPhone size in said this size so what you need to do is be really taking in the mind um the specifics of what it's spitting out because it's going to try and go off the rails a little bit so telling it the dimensions and reemphasizing things is important which we'll get to here in a second um but you can see as I'm going through this right here I'm able to take this image and en use it to create several other images so you can tell it to okay put put this person in front of fire okay now put this in front of uh in a Solo leveling anime design right here so you can see we can just really tell it what we want and I'm sure as you play with this you're going to get better at talking to it you can see that the prompts I'm using right here making sure you can see these they're not exactly Advanced prompts we make this image in a solo level anime style holding a futuristic shotgun not too complicated right here but you can start to see the potential with this when it comes to ads because it allows you to create several different ads in different templates Styles colors everything very rapidly for example what I can do right here is I can take myself if we're just looking at like basic image type creation right here I can take a picture of myself and then make a picture of myself uh for promotions for example YouTube thumbnails or content for Twitter so you can just see how easy it is to move characters and images and kind of pass around your idea around a lot of things so I'm going to be getting into actually how to make faces and stuff look like you here in a second but let's just focus back on the the basics right here so the next thing I want to show you right here is you can see this this original image of myself I created here and I just want to show you how specific you can get right here so remake this image in the same style of Soul leveling but gave the character glowing blue eyes like Jin Wu and some scenes reference in the second photo they'll keep the same character design in the first footo but remove the sunglasses give the character the glowing eyes and have him looking down at the viewer but bam so this right here isn't too applicable to like ads or anything like that I just wanted to show you how specific it can get and I can't stress how crazy this is cuz um if if you look at stable diff Fusion the way you you generate ads is you have to go in and like type in I'm just showing you this this screen here to kind of show you how far it's come cuz it's mind-blowing but if we come right here the way we have to generate ads is by like putting in a prompt so if I'm like doing something like this I have to put in a photo of Becker cyberpunk background holding shotgun uh purple lighting okay and I can go right here and I can generate an image like this on my computer but this is how you have to you have to communicate with these things in the past and I'm just going to do an image to image generation right here and just generate a really quick one this is going to look terrible but you can see this this came out super bad right here cuz I haven't really set the settings but you can see how non-user friendly this is I would have to actually go and like adjust this right here generate it again and you can see we just we we really can't get down to the level of specifics that we can get in chat GPT with with ease so you can I really just want to stress to you just how good you have it at at this point in time with these images even if I'm just going over here to like text image I'm having to go and like communicate with it like this and you can see it really just you can see we got a pretty good image right here from it but you can see we really have to like communicate with differently and we can't get specific whereas I can just type in exactly what I want in chat gbt so this is like revolutionary crazy cool uh the fact that we can use this for ads day one is crazy so how we use this for actual ads let's actually get down to that start um or that type of process so of course really basic stuff we can do we can of course use it to create characters different images for ads and and whatnot but I want to kind of show you how I'm using it in particular so um let's go and look at this one right here so here's one where I went and I grabbed an image and you can see this image right here okay of course it's iock right here but the image we're ending up with is not the iock photo we're just using this as inspiration so what I want to show you right here first off is that you can go and create images simply by taking the photo and then drawing on it now I'm not actually using this image right here this is all just for Education what I just wanted to show how we can use this to instruct chat GPT so you can see I put like an image of a desk right here a guy walking in and so this is going to really kind of show the system how I want to make the ad so then I can go right here and put this right here okay so then what I can do is with this you want to see I want to I want to customize this image to maybe my Facebook ads so what I want to do is I wanted to convert this to a meme okay so you can see right here I have this and I'm slowly actually making this picture more relevant so you can see I told it to put like the Facebook ad ad manager and whatnot right here and kept evolving it now you can see I got really specific with this I was able to add lighting a person the ad manager crying or whatnot and then what I did is I just went and added some meme text on top of this to kind of complete this to create an image like this right here and so you can see I was able to very easily create a meme like image in seconds using chat gbt we can then upload to Facebook now if I want it I can go and actually just change everything about this to make this creative in multiple different ways so what I can do right here is I can come in I can say uh change the flames in this photo to green and keep everything else exactly the same so I can go get this photo put it in right here and in what chat gp2 will go and change the photo and the background everything to green and so you can see it's starting up now we'll check this result here in a few seconds so you can see the image has been created here and we can now use this to create endless amounts of variation of our creative for testing or just replace the the creative that is working with different colors and schemes every single day so we never have ad blindness that's pretty crazy now uh let me show you another example right here so I wanted to do one where I wanted to create this scene that we're looking at right here but in different styles so we can basically take the same exact ad and uh use it over and over again in different styles and themes so you can see this one right here I use it to create this image and so I just drew this out I decided to I said make a comic panel this is what's going on in the top panel I described a bunch of people engineer helmets and whatever and then I described these little bubbles right here and so you can see how well chat GPT can do text which is again incredible that's something you can't do in stable diffusion or anything on your computer so what I was thinking is like let's change this to different types of creative Styles so we can just pce this up and see what styles gting the most clicks so I said okay um shrink the image right here so it fits for Facebook ads but then change it to Studio gibl style okay and then I create different variations of this ad uh and minutes and so look I have like three different variations three different styles of these ads um all within about like 5 minutes of work so this is a way that you can easily use this to I think you can I think of all the possibilities here we can just create endless ads different styles different creatives different colors everything we want to do right here easily so I could come in here if I wanted to change this to like Pixar style I could say change this to Pixar style what you can see with this ad that I created right here look at look at all the variations of this ad I was able to create okay and so I just want to show you this one right here as the last example U make a three panel comic and Studio giblo style man is sitting in front of laptop panel two his wife is doing this this and you can even see how specific I can get so in this photo um and you can see just how specific we can get right here I can say all right I don't want this guy's face right here I want his wife's face right here and with a little bit of guidance for example I was able to draw a circle and say no replace this face right here don't add another face I was able to go and remove the face and put this right here so you can just see how specifically we can get with our flows and um creative we get with our ads you can see you can make anything so I want to talk a little bit about Ecom application right here what we're trying to do here with e-commerce ad say we want to make a really nice looking e-commerce ad or we want to make someone holding a bottle or arpr or anything we can just take a picture of something and throw it in here so if I wanted to I'm not making too many e-commerce ads right now but I think you probably get the gist of everything we want to do with this I can go and create my own bottle or design just by taking a picture of another ad and saying um create a beautiful wintry feeling ad with lotion in a Black Bottle similar to this image ad okay and then I could go right here and I could say put woman holding this bottle or I could literally just take a picture of some some product or my e-commerce product and then say make a picture of someone holding this product and displaying it for customers or something like that let's just literally do an example right here so we're going to go grab this image and I'm going to put say make a picture of a fat man in a gray shirt in front of a fire background holding this product clearly make the focus the product and put text at the top that says what a bad ad okay and so this just really to show you the potential of everything we can do as far as e-commerce goes and you can see just how specific we can get um with this now I'm going to make a slightly better looking ad right here since I was just showing you that but you can see in the original ad right here how nice we can make these ads look so this just gives you endless opportunities with uh e-commerce ads I can make this look really realistic and make it look like it's taken on an iPhone it it really doesn't matter and this right here like look at the detail of the text everything this is insane this is insane so obviously I think your your your juices should be buzzing if you run any type of e-commerce ads you see the massive amount of potential right here and I'm just going to go generate one more ad with this product right here so you can kind of see the potential I don't think I have to lay out to you what you can do with this going forward and it just if we want to make a better looking ad so make a very high quality ritzy elegant one to one dimension add displaying this product slightly burd and St I mean look at this this is this is incredible so the last thing I want to talk about before I get into any advanced tactics is I want to talk about ads particular if you're like an influencer or a personal brand because what chat GB fails at is this so for example if you come into this and I'm going to go let's go look at this monster hunter thumbnail I was making okay so look at these images right here I'm creating using the same exact flows that we've seen already so I said put myself in this image holding the sword in front of this monster right here so you can see chat gbt is actually really bad at faces this looks nothing like me so I want to show you a few Solutions I use to create these so if you're beginner one of the easiest ways to do this is you can just use a face swapping AI so if we come in here there's tons of AIS that you can use to just switch it out you can use face swap or AI whatever and these are just really super duper simple face swapping tools and all you do is you you put in a picture of your face and you can swap the faces over so this is where I would start if you're a beginner now these aren't particularly great for if you're making really serious influencer ads or whatever because the faces are just not going to match what you need they're not going to be the high quality you want um and so if we want to make really really good thumbnails I'm just going to give you a few little Advanced Techniques right here what you want to have is you want to use something like foul AI to go and train actually a picture of your yourself so what we can do is we can come in here come to this website and this is going to be more for advanced users you're just going to have to dig into this yourself I don't want to get into a whole entire lower training video or anything like that I just wanted to show you this so you can potentially just hire someone to do with this for you which is what I suggest and you just so you know this exist so you want to find someone to go to a site like fou AI or just train it locally on their computer and you can create what is called a Laura and so what luras are are basically files that allow you to save a character or design or style of image and so what I'm going to show you right here is how I created this image right here of myself and you can see that I'm able to generate pictures of myself not great what I want to do is come in and in paint these a little bit later on but what I do is I go and generate the picture originally inside of chat gbt so I generate the base images okay then I'm going to use either one of those face swapping tools I talked about just Google it experiment with different face swappers they're very cheap most of them are free or you want the hire our pace going to train you a model so I know all about training models and stuff like that so I just train my own model based on my face now you can see this is a really rough image because I drained the entire thing but what we're going to do is we're going to go and take this inside of stable diffusion AI on our computer and you can see then I can go and basically highlight over my face and you can see I'm accessing my model or my lore right here so I'm just going to inpaint my face right in here and then the result that is going to come out is I'm just going to show you this cuz it takes a few few minutes too long to generate while I'm filming on here but you can see the end result when we go and remove all the things right here is a face that looks a lot more like mine being generated inside the image and if I sat here and kind of like edited and and painted in I can get really really close to my face and this isn't even a specifically well-trained model so for if you're making ads for yourself your personal brand you're trying to put yourself in funny locations and stuff like that the flow you're going to use is generating the base image in chat GPT and then coming in and inating face using a fate swapping tool or just having a generation model made for you and so this what I showed you right here is not exactly a limited skill set not a lot of people know how to do this but it's not something you could pay someone 50 bucks to go put your face into it or hire someone to just quickly do this for you or generate a model you could also go and just look at how to use stable diffusion on your computer if you're not a technical person it's going to be a little bit challenging so I just wanted to show you that this exists so you know with the higher at least the faces and getting faces inside of images is the one thing chat gbt does very very poorly and every other image generation tool online does very very poorly so I think probably give it another couple months and that's going to be finished but that's how you handle that from now now the next thing I want to show you is how to use consistent characters for your ads so what we can do is for example I went and create this character for my ads all I did is I took a picture of Dwight from the office and then I used that I said create a character in a scene like this whose fat glasses up and I basically just made made a fat Dwight Okay so what you can also do is you can then go and give chat GPT a base image so I created this character and I said create a character sheet of this character right here okay so now I can do something like put this character sitting at a bar facing the camera using the same style drawing technique okay and so what I want to do is if I want to make ads and I have like a mascot or something like that I can quickly go and just create this character uh and place it quickly in ads over and over again so I can have like mascots or whatever so you can see like for example with hyros I wanted to create a a hyos character kind of similar to raster and Rivals and I'm not using this right here I'm not stealing raster okay love Rivals someone's going to watch it be like how dare you but you can see I can create like a gray version of them instantly or I can take images that artists create for me and use it to create tons of different images of that character okay so it can get very specific you can see how closely was able to replicate raster in different images and stuff like that so want to laid it out cuz creating consistent characters for your ads is something obviously people are going to want to do so let's see how this ad came out with him in a bar okay so you can see right here we have our consistent character now sitting at a bar and so what I can do is you can do all sorts of really neat stuff with this you could actually go and have chat GPT design the background and then say inject this character and you can create all sorts of angles and whatnot using this so I'm sure this probably gets your mind spinning right here the final little tip I'm going to give you is if you're not using drawn characters which that's where it starts to get really hairy because the specifics on a drawing character very small so cat GPT can get those right if we start making realistic images the body shape and everything starts kind of twisting so for example if you see with the monster hunter example I gave you you can see the body of the character keeps changing as I consistently start making the ads so every single time I say make a new ad it kind of like changes the character design just slightly every single time so this is kind of a pain in the butt especially when we get to like real faces where people notice the subtleties in faces so little I'm going to give you just for creation right here is if you're having trouble with this find a celebrity that has the same body type as yours if you don't want to go train models and whatnot find a celebrity has the same body type as yours consistently and so for example if you have a body similar like Robie D Jun chat GPD knows what he looks like then you generate images with him in the image and then you go change the face to yours or or whatever your your character is okay so outside of chat GPT using a face swapping tool or that stable diffusion technique I should you so that's just a little hack right there now the final thing I'm going to show you is just how we use this for Mass ad creation so obviously think of all the things we can do here we can obviously go and generate countless pictures of ourselves tons of different creative change the style change the colors change everything how do we test this with ads so in the next video I have coming up here I'm going to show you how we test all these ads all at once but just to kind of give you an idea of how to get started what I do is I just go and create an ad set for each batch of ads every single day if I'm doing this so for example like the the money burning ads you can see I just uploaded them all right here and then I can easily go in and I can see which ones are getting the most Impressions so this ad right here in this style gets the best Impressions I'm going to then graduate this to my major ad sets but as you can see I then also go and see which ones are getting the lowest cost per call so you can see like this one right here had a bunch of major winners in it and I'm getting $100 calls by the way just an FYI you should be using hyros to track these results because again Facebook is just missing so much of our tracking right here Google's going to miss so much of your tracking this is giving me the accurate data I need to see which ads are actually winners right here for these specific test so I can see this one's just a major winner and I wouldn't have been able to see that if I was using standard tracking so please after this video as well if you want to use this to its Max degree you should be tracking with hyros it's going to make you so much more money from your ads everybody uses it we guarantee you're going to see increase in your ad ey by 15% just by using this basic data right here don't even get into how we can actually train your AI to Target better on Facebook which you should do with hyros as well makes it even cheaper but you're just you're not going to be running your ads even near their maximum efficiency you're going to be paying more for a customer you're going to be turning off ads that are profitable um leaving on ads that are unprofitable just a whole mess with your ads if you're not using hyros tracking so come use hyros tracking we guarantee you'll see an increase in AD or you don't pay for it like actually literally and we have thousands and thousands and thousands of customers so that obviously works you can go look at our trust PL reviews and everything all the famous people that use it hos is absolutely awesome you should come check it out I'm very proud of it so that is a really basic tutorial on all the ways you can be using chat GPT for your advertising particularly with images now don't even get me started with what we can do with generating consistent characters backgrounds and in making animations and videos for our images it's a little bit more tedious than this but that's nothing that someone on your team if you train them to do it could not handle as their day-to-day job you could have three or four different animations going up every single day that look great which we're going to talk about in future videos next video we have coming up I'm actually going to break down how I'm testing and putting these all on Facebook and using this I'm sure if you're experienced ad run it's not going to be some crazy mystery but with this much creative being Unleashed we have to actually start running ads in a different way because before you'd have to submit to a cartoonist you get your ads back a week later and you maybe have four or five different ads a week now you can have 200 different creative ads every single week so how are we going to test this how are we going to grow this how are we going to use this to uh make a lot more sales for our business so that's the video for today this is crazy stuff hopefully it kind of engages your mind and gets you thinking about the ways you can use this because honestly there's an endless amount some creative ways to use this and those are some of the best tactics that I found to get what I want in a chat GP and then kind of push it around to alter the images how I want so I'll see you in the next video
