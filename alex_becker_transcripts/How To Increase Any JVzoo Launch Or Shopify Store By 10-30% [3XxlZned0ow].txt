[Music] Nation what's going on this is Becker and I uh don't have anything witty to say so we're going to dive straight into it if you use Shopify or do any form of e-commerce or you're launching products on JV Zoo paid Kickstarter Warrior plus this video is going to show you to increase your business by another 20 to 30% by doing something that's actually really easy to do inside of markco hero and that is set up followup emails upsell emails down sell emails and cart abandonment emails and inside the system now with our Shopify app and with our integration in JV Zoo you're able to do stuff that you've never been able to do on Shopify or JB Zoo paid Kickstarter any other affiliate marketing platform where you get people to promote your launches so what I want to do is just dive straight into it but we got to get something witty in here it's my promise to you guys so before we get going why don't they play cards in the jungle don't know too many cheetahs ah okay all right let's let's just dive into it now I'm I'm sorry for that okay guys so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to show you you exactly how to dramatically increase your sales while not really changing anything in your business using jbu or Shopify now I know some people here watching this video might exclusively do either or okay you might just only be doing Shopify you might just only doing JV Zoo So Below this video I've left time stamps of what you can skip to if you want to see both just start watching right now so let's go find an old product of mine and let's let's kind of break this down so you can see right here let's just use this an example Source Hunter so let's imagine someone comes right here and I'm launching this product on JV Zoo so what most people do is the product is bought and then immediately they get offered an upsell now if the person doesn't buy that upsell nothing happens they just continue the product and that's it they don't get followed up with or anything that loses you so much money so much money on the back end because every person who doesn't buy every person that abandons that card essentially is not buying on top of that what happens if they buy that upsell and then don't buy the next upsell again you're losing more money so let's go through a situation real quick let's imagine you launch a product person gets the upsell immediately after they get the upsell they don't buy and they continue through so what you do is you follow up with them on the upsell via your email they open email they then say you know what I think I want this upsell no they buy that and then they buy the next upsell after your first upsell yous SP saying that email you've completely recovered hundreds of dollars and this is exactly how you do it so let's just say right here I have two upsells we started here on the source Hunter silver plan we'll just imagine this is our initial product so we're going to go and we're going to go right here and Market hero inside of JB Zoo now we're going to set the tag as bot a okay this will represent them buying our first step cell and then what we want to do is set up another tag for the next step cell but in this one I'm just going to do hypothetically but right here we've connected the integration inside of Market hero so the next thing we're going to do is we're going to go and create what I like to call a product launch funnel okay guys so we're just going to build this from stretch and it's actually really easy to do now there's a ton of different ways we can create a card abandonment funnel and an UPS cell funnel in Market hero I'm going to use the easiest way and show you the simplest way to understand it so first thing that's going to happen right here is we're going to have Market hero use a start Action Now what a start action does is when an email is applied from JV zoo and it has a tag for example the tag we just set that's applied when someone buys this product what's going to happen is they're going to get shot through the system and get sent directly to this funnel whenever these tags are applied now what we're also going to do is we're going to have it remove people from every other fun funel or whatever funnel they are in at the current time pretty simple so what's going to happen is we're going to set it to wait 10 minutes so let's imagine they just bought the product and the first tag got applied and the start action has begun so we're going to have it wait 10 minutes right here now what's going to happen is after 10 minutes they obviously have not bought the product okay they haven't they haven't gone through they haven't picked up the upsell so we want to do is we want to sell send them an email saying hey you forgot the upsell you might want to go back and check this out so what's going to happen right here is we're going to send them an upsell email saying hey you didn't buy the upsell uh we're going to give you a discount on it right now you can go come back and check it out so what's going to happen at this point in time is we're going to go and create another start action so what's going to happen and this is pretty cool is we're going to set this to the tag that will be applied when the upsell was bot so we're going to put in bot B okay so this is the upsell right here so what happens during this delay period right here if they buy the upsell the first upsell what's going to happen is the tag bot B is going to be applied to them and they're going to be yanked out of this process right here and sent into this process now if they don't buy it what's going to happen is that bot B will not be applied therefore they're going to stay in this process and they're going to get the upsell email and we can keep firing these emails off to them we could have this one send a day after saying hey you know it's been a day we're going to offer you an even crazier discount on what you could have P before you can pick up the first upsell so we do that again easy now at anytime during this process if they buy the second upsell the tag bot B is going to be applied to them them so right here we see bot B applied right there and they're going to get sent to the start action and then we do the same exact thing let's say we have three upsells so what's going to happen immediately after they buy this the first upsell they're going to get offered the second upsell now what's going to happen right here is we're going to do the same exact sequence we're going to wait 10 minutes and see if they buy it or not if they do buy it what's going to happen if they do buy the second upso we'll have another tag right here that's apply to them and it will say bot C okay so what's going to happen is the same thing that happen before they're going to go through and if they buy in this time frame they'll be yanked out of here and sent to the next part of the funnel right here and so we can constantly keep doing that let's just imagine we send a welcome email right here or they're at the end of The Funnel and so we have a follow-up process for every single product in our funnel and this alone right here is something you're not able to do in get response something you're not able to do in anything else and just sending out these emails right here can recover so much lost income and increase your launch or your product selling by 10 to 20% just by adding this to your system and it's so easy to do so again what happens person buys the tag is applied saying they just bought the product then what happens is it waits 10 minutes to see if they buy the first product if they buy the first product they get yanked down here to the next part of the funnel because bot B the tag has been applied to them pretty cool right but if they don't buy we keep sending them emails encouraging them to buy the first upsell now the second they buy the first upsell what happens they're going to get offered the second upsell and it's going to do the same delay process now if they buy the second upsell what's going to happen happen is going to shoot them down here to the end of the funnel if they don't buy the second upsell we're going to keep sending them followup emails encouraging them to also buy the second upell this alone right here will make your JV so much more money increase the value every click sent to your launch now let's go and set up something very similar to this in Shopify so I'm going to clear this out right here just take a mental image right here and let's go build this in Shopify now also before we hop in JB zo there is a free trial for and now also before we hop into Shopify there is a free trial below so if you're launching products on JV zo or you're doing something like that right now go below start your free trial apply this to your next launch and make 10 to 20% more just by adding this simple process in there so we're going to hop over here and you can see here is my example Shopify store so what's going to happen is we're going to build an upsell funnel for this t-shirt right here so we're going to go down to the market Hero app in our store and you can see right here we have the market herero app all loaded up inside the store so here's a few things we're going to do after we cut connect our API key I'm going to set up a few options in here first off whenever they enter the store no matter what they're doing they're going to have this tag applied to them shop one to tell me what store they came from now I can also set up tags based on specific people that come into my store but we'll get into this in a later video when I explain the Shopify app even more I just want to show you the first way to easily increase your business but we can e easily sort segments by people that haven't bought yet people that have bought and are in Japan people that have bought and also bought this product and will automatically segment them by their tags inside of Market hero now what we're going to do right here is let's imagine we're looking at this shirt right here the dev black hole you can see here's the shirt that we're looking at so what's going to happen when a person comes to start the checkout process let's imagine we start the checkout process right now going to go in and I'm going to start the checkout process by hitting add the cart I'm going go to go to cart and I'm going to hit check out so as we're checking out right here the first step in any checkout process is to enter our email and our information so let's imagine the person begins checking out right here they enter their email and they enter their information so we just hit get shipping method so now we have to go and start paying for stuff and this is where you lose people a lot of people will abandon cart here's how you stop this so you see right here first thing we're going to do is we're going to set up a start action and what's going to be applied to them as we can see right here from the checkout options we've set it is they're going to have the tag start shirt appli to them so we're going to set the start action right here to fire off when the tag start shirt is applied cool right so then we're we're going to do right here is we're going to do the same weight sequence we did before and we're going to see if they buy the shirt or not so what's going to happen is we're going to have a sort action right here so what's going to happen I'm going to go and hit this by sort by tag now the tag that's going to be applied when they complete checkout will be bought shirt and then the value will actually be applied to them telling us how much that lead is worth and telling us how many shirts they actually bought but before we get to that what we're going to have is we're going to sort by tag we're going to make it bot shirt and you can see these types of tags right here this event right here is a purchase event so we're going to have a money tag applied to them this also carries a value that tells us how much the lead is worth in the long term so what's going to happen right here let's imagine they do not complete checkout so after 10 minutes of waiting it's going to go and sort by it and it's going to say hey this person in complete checkout so what we're going to do is we're going to send them to a follow-up process says hey you forgot to check out come back you can link them back to your cart and send them directly back to go and check out and finish the check out for the product if they did buy it what what you can immediately do is upsell them so let's say we want to sell them shirt number two okay we sell them a shirt like that and we can do another funnel just like this so we send them right here say Hey you like this shirt maybe you should go check out these products they're similar to it and so we can have is another sort by tag right here that allows them to sort let's just say we do um bot shirt B is a tag that's showing that they purchase that and boom what's going to happen is we do the same exact upsell funnel right here so what's going to happen after they bought that first shirt they're going to get upsold again if they don't buy it get an upself emo right there and if they do buy it let's just say we let them off the hook at this point in time but you can see just by doing this we're able to follow up with people that abandon our cart and if they do buy something we're able to upsell them immediately doing this alone will easily add another 10 to 20% from your store and you just canot afford to do this and the really cool thing right here is let's imagine a person comes and buys multiple shirts from you so let me just go find every person that has the tag bot shirt in my system these are examples of course but you can see right here I'm I'm able to go and track how many times they buy the shirt and other products they pick up so I can see you know every person that buys a $25 shirt is also buying a lot of this one product and they're buying quantities of this other product so what you could do in your funnel is go back on over to it and be like hey look we noticed you bought this shirt you should probably buy these products right here as well a lot of people that buy this product buy this product as well so this right here guys is how you can it's just in seconds really just took 10 seconds to really explain not 10 seconds but you get the drift to expl how to do this and this is how you can go and dramatically dramatically dramatically increase the amount of sales you're making in JB zoo and the amount of sales you're making on your Shopify store just by picking up Market hero and just adding these quick little things in here there's no other autoresponder you can do this stuff in and uh I'm pretty proud of that so if you enjoyed this be sure to leave a comment below if you have any questions and there's a free trial link below here so you can check out Market hero start doing this to your stores and launches as well so that being said this has been Becker this is an easy way to improve your launches in Shopify and uh that's all I got in this video so till then take it easy
