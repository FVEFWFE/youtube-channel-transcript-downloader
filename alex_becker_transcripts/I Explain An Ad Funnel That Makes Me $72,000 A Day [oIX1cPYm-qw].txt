hi you run ads on Facebook and Google and nobody buys your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or maybe they're not buying your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the rates that you like them to buy your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at and you don't know why maybe it's because what you're selling sucks just kidding that couldn't possibly be it not in a thousand years there's obviously something wrong with the people on the internet there's something wrong with Facebook and Google ads what you're selling is by far the best product to ever exist on Planet Earth it couldn't possibly be the issue and that issue is what we're going to clear up today because in this video I'm going to give you an ad funnel that you can use on your Facebook Google or if you interact with that filth known as gen Z on Tik Tock ads you can use this ad funnel to sell virtually more of anything and I know a lot of people that make ad content promise you that but I can tell you this as a fact because I have more subscribers to them and more subscribers equals better ad know how just kidding the reason I can tell you this is because I've been applying this to my businesses and it absolutely shs money compared to funnels I've ran in the past and if you don't know I've been running ads for almost a decade now I built multiple businesses past eight figures I've even built a nine figure business all fueled by ads and on top of that I am the CEO of one of the largest ad tracking companies on the entire internet which allows me to see what's working across billions of dollars in ad spend per month so if you're going to get your ad knowhow from somebody you could get it from worst sources so what I want to do is I want to break down this funnel to you because what it allows you to do is basically net in tons and tons of customers that are likely to buy your product very very cheap deeply and then once you have these people it then allows you to hit them right in the jugler and do the number one thing that's going to get them to come to your site and buy something and so what I've been doing is I've been running this one two punch combination recently cost per call goes down cost per sale goes down and the money we make the number that goes up which is very nice so if you enjoy making more money from your ads as opposed to less money listen to this it works very well let me show you so look this method I'm going to show you right here is turbocharged by the funnels that I've taught you on this channel and the test monial Gathering method that I've taught you on this channel as well everything that I mention as additional content in this video by the way it's all on this channel for free I'm already incredibly rich I don't need to sell you anything I just want to help you with your advertising so that you make more money and then when you make more money you might want to actually track your ads because if you track where your sales are coming from you can get more of them in an efficient way and make more money which I assume is your goal here so I figure if I help you make enough money here you'll eventually want to stop running your ads like a blind baboon and make more money from them and then you'll pick up hyros that's the strategy I hope it works so hey below this video go in the description get the additional content the funnels the testimonial method cuz I'm not going to cover those in this video because then this would be like an hour long video and I know you have the ADHD of a toddler so I'm going to try and rush through this snippit this bite-sized piece of content to get it to you super quick so the way this method works is you have to understand the Baseline of getting anybody to buy anything from you in there now there's a whole bunch of hoopla you can do you can make a pretty page and have some crazy Spiel texts on it you can have Jessica Alba come down from a parachute and say whatever you're selling doesn't suck but if you really want to get anybody to buy anything it comes down to these two things now this is a very big simplification but one you need their attention Okay need their attention you also need a way to Target them efficiently which it's it's I'm going to keep this at two things but it's technically three so you need their attention or why do you need their attention cuz they're not going to hear you or see you or pay attention to and then you can't sell them [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so that's wrapped up right there pretty obvious but two they need to believe that it's going to get the result that they're looking for now these these seem so simple but everybody F them up a lot of people the reason why their ads don't work is no one pays attention to them and then when people see the ad and click the page they don't believe it's going to get them the result they want in return for what they're paying it's really just that damn simple if you had a skincare product that everyone believ would make their wrinkles go away 100% you could charge $1,000 a bottle like G Peri does if you had a shoe that made people run faster people would pay thousands of dollars for it so they could win their races if you had a product that guaranteed delivered an Roi every single time and everybody believed when they saw your page they they actually truly believe that they gave you $1,000 they' make $3,000 $55,000 you wouldn't have any problem selling your product the problem is that's not the case and the way you're hitting your customers is not achieving these two things with a mix of this targeting Third Secret step right here this what I'm going to show you right here solves all of these so let's start from the beginning so I'm going to break down a funnel that I've been running at hyos but this applies to virtually anything so look this basically has two steps and what we're doing is we're building an ad funnel so what is an ad funnel an ad funnel is basically where you use a series of ads to get a person to a destination because in basic terms when you first interact with a customer and the last time you interact with a customer in completely different states of Minds the first time you interact with them they have no idea who you are or what you do or how you you have none of their attention whatsoever you don't even know what they're into okay and then by the end of it they do know who you are they've probably built some rapport with them and they're in a completely different state of mind and Report with you by the time they see your last ad so what we do is we use ads to build an initial relationship and then we use ads to close them and we go down this chain this is pretty common but the way we're doing it here is a little bit unique so how can we go and get their attention in the most maximal bigly way convince them that our product works this is how so what I've been doing at hyros and I will work anywhere else as you might notice we've been running some really goofy goofy ass ads if you've ever seen for example I'm not going to play all these ads right here CU they're really there's not much to them that I could break down quickly in a video I I copy wrote it and wrote all these ads but if you go and watch them which I'll link to one of them Below in the video it's very similar to The Squatty Potty famous ads you saw back in the day or the ads that purple used to run just goofy attention grabbing ads that really lay out the benefit of the product hey this is hyos here's a funny explanation of what we do we track ads in a way that maximizes revenue and on average businesses that come and use us make 15 to 20% more we guarantee it or you do not pay for it which we actually do if you want to track your eyes you come track us out but very simple that's the goal of this ad right here I want to catch their attention and introduce them to what we do and why we rock at it while setting up a good brand Rapport now this these ads right here are kind of expensive to make you got to have a crew and whatnot you can achieve the same effect of this for example if you've ever seen my my Pikachu ad on YouTube for hyos or you ever saw any of my ads for hcom or info products we used to sell if you can get a $70 green screen you can make funny ads you can if you don't want to be in the ad you can have someone come to your house I guess and read a script for you I don't know you might have to leave your comfort zone just a little bit to make millions of dollars in business I hate to break it too but these ads you don't need to have these high production value ads I've gotten the same effect in ctrs and whatever with just me in a green screen wearing a Pikachu suit or doing something creative and I'll link to a few of those uh lowbudget ads below here so why am I doing this all right so if you look at any AD platform you're able to retarget people that view your ads for a certain amount of time at least YouTube and Facebook I'm not super familiar with Tik Tok ads cuz if I go on that website I I get a case of AIDS almost immediately it takes me weeks to clear up I just don't go there anymore by all means you can do it but what these sites allow you to do is build audiences based on views so for example Facebook is going to allow you to send in everybody that viewed these funny ads now I'm going to go and target people that viewed these ads for more than 30 seconds why do I do this not 30% 30 seconds 45 seconds give or take the higher you increase this time right here the better the audience is going to be but it's going to be smaller so why do I do this I want to pull every single person that is interested in an ad about running ads more efficiently and so the ad is built for maximum attention okay and so I'm maximizing the amount of people that are interested in ads that will view this ad past 30 seconds I just want to build this giant audience nobody who's not interested in ads is going to be sitting around watching this ad video anybody that is is going to see this video and the fact that it's so weird and kind of unique is going to get them to view it for at least 3 seconds so then I have this big old audience right here that knows what we do and what we are essentially okay so all right hirers is that company that tracks ads guarantees an increase in ad spend Roi supposedly they they claim what they do is pretty special and I'll make more money if I use them so where is this person at right now they know who we are they know what we do we know what we promise but there's one thing missing right here so of course on these these ads right here I'm going to link to our website you know and if you go to our website I mean I think we have a pretty good website I've did all the copywriting and everything for these pages I think it's good but this isn't the the secret sauce right here I'm just send the website go find all your things maybe we can get into how this website is designed to convert later on but not right now what we're really missing in this situation is the fact that the customer does not believe in the result I mean why would they they just met me I'm I'm like Hey we're going to make you give us a, bucks we're going to make you like a billion dollars they're not going to believe me right away okay so that's fine because I have them in the Rapport state right now where they know who we are what we do and what we promise great so once they're on this big list right here what I'm going to do I found just works so much better than everything else is just go straight for the jugular with testimonials and then bash them over the head with what I like to call the testimonial page of Truth and Justice so what is this so I want to show you by far our best converting ad okay and this actually pisses me off because I like to do creative things I would love if I could make those big creative um high quality videos and those things converted but they don't really convert really well they just get attention they just get lots of attention and brand Rapport the thing that converts really well is this and it's so simple and it's so stupid that it makes me sad because I just have to do simple and stupid things all day it's simply add getting testimonials from as big and as many people as we can so if we go right here and you look at this ad right here we have testimon some some really big brands at hyros now are you going to have testimonials from famous celebrities and giant businesses when you start your business no you're probably not that's fine hrus is a business valued at hundreds of millions of dollars we've been around for like a decade we've built up tons of testimonials report and results over the years so of course don't expect to have those same results but if you want to see how to get testimonials and how to stack them up very very quickly at your business there's a video right below here that shows you how my exact process for getting testimonials results and famous people and Brands to use your company it's all right below this video so you build your way up to this and you use kind of a testimonial ladder to get to the bigger names and whatnot but I'm not going to talk about that right now cuz there's a whole entire video about it below so if we go to this ad right here you can see we just have endless testimonials from like giant Brands and really well-known people so obviously getting testimonals from really big Brands and well-known people is great obviously what do we want to put in these specific ads right here the most important and most impactful one is again what I just laid out right there but testimonies from your customers that are based around these specific results so for example when I see people running business ads B2B ads they put like customer support was great or wow such a warm great business I really feel successful with this no if you're a business or B2B ads business your only thing you want to have in the ads specifically if they're not from really well-known people if it's from a well-known pear just use whatever you're going to get but if you don't have that and you're giving it from customers it has to be based around the direct result AK we made money if it's B2B if it's skin care my skin is cleared up in this amount of time or what I feel works most of all or best in e-commerce if you can is some type of scientific proof so for example last last week I talked about how people are making a killing selling cotton gym clothes because everybody's getting plastic in their balls from their polyester shorts so our company I saw was doing really well put up a big old study on how everyone's balls are being savagely wrecked by microplastics that's a result right there the result is your balls don't get cancer or a really successful neut Tropic company that I saw back in the day what they did to make their ads appear way more legit is I got a bunch of independent studies and they showed all those results right there and eventually I think they got like a testimony from Joe Rogan so they combine these both together so those are the two things you're going to want to shoot for obviously testimonal from customers you should have those get them from as big as well-known people as you can and then use scientific case studies and backing and whatnot or for a really good example um from like the lower kind of B Toc you can see some school's advertisements where alosi is basically like um on average every single person that starts a school business makes at least $1,500 per month really great stats like that work really well now this is not the whole case of it what we're doing is we just hook them in with report so they know who we are and now we are undeniably proving that we get the result that they're looking for and is important to them now of course when they come to your site there's going to be games with price and how much the result is worth to them so for example if you're selling like a a guitar lessons course no one's going to be paying a 2K for that course unless there's something really special inside it or something whereas if you you're selling a business product that makes someone $220,000 per month you can easily charge them $1,000 per month no problem so again it's based on the products I think we all understand so I'm not going to talk about that but we're proving them undeniably that the result is there and so we have this huge audience of people that are target market have their attention now we're showing them a result and getting them interest what we have to do is we have to get them to click so preferably what you want to do in these ads I'm not doing this this one but we're running a new one starting this week that does is you want to remove all risk and give them a reason or an urgent reason to click the ad this is going to drive your CTR up and then also remove the friction so for example in our new ad when a person clicks it it points out at the beginning of the year people are going to be able to get our new AI Suite which is pretty sweet I'm not going to I'm done Shilling hos in this video let's just get you the content I think you're already sold anyways you'll be buying immediately after this video but what we do is we point out that if they click now they're going to get this upgrade or whatever for free so there's a reason to click now there's a reason to click now that's all that's really there it just has to be a reason to click now you can get even crazier with it like the price increases tomorrow what out but whenever you use massive crazy scarcity for example you see like internet marketers who have a new discounted onetime lifetime price every other week that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gets old with customers real quick so I I prefer really to be kind of lowkey and just have a very low subtle reason to click and then what I have right here is a guarantee like your ads grow you don't pay you want to have some bold crazy guarantee because you need to have a a big bed on the table moment so for example if I told you I can shoot a three-pointer from across the court uh 50 out of 50 times in a row you say well I don't believe you but I've said okay well here's $50,000 in the table if I go in the court right now and shoot 50 in a row you you have to pay me 50 Grand now what is that going to do because I just put 50 Grand down on the table you're a little bit more skeptical about judging me on there like if this guy's going to put 50 Grand behind us it he probably can do it that's the same thing with refund guarantees you want to use refund guarantees as a sales tactic in themselves so for example at hyros if your ads don't grow by 15% you don't have to pay for it if you don't want that's that sounds absurd so a person's like well if he's going to make this guarantee and they've been around for a long time this crap must obviously work especially since they have all these testimonials so now we're really laying into the person with these results results results and then what we're going to do is we're going to link them to what I like to call the results page of Truth and Justice what is this it is just a obnoxious page full of results so I think I told this story a few videos ago back when I used to sell uh little scuzzy scam products they weren't scams but they were this is about as lowlevel only fans internet marketing as you can get selling W so's on Warrior form woo that was some dark times back in 2012 is 2013 anyways so what are we doing on this page whenever I was on the forums people have these crazy long sales pages with like the the most wingding Dan Kennedy sales copyrighting you ever see you could you could tell they spent like a year writing this thing just oh just the chef's kiss what I would do that I found works much better is I would just make like a a post selling something I'd write like some short copy and then I would just Spam it with results I just Spam there just be pages and pages and pages and pages and videos and videos just like obscene amount you can't scroll past it you're not even going to attempt to scroll past the amount of results this converts so much better than everything else why cuz the only thing people really care about is if they give you money they get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] result if you had a skincare cream like I said that actually got rid of wrinkles and people believed it would do it they'd pay you $200 $500 a bottle for it all day Kim Kardash should be smearing on her butt and put it all over Instagram you'd be crapping money but the thing the reason why people don't buy your product is they don't believe it's going to get them the result that's really what it comes down to or in the rare cases you've completely priced it out of the market so you like have a skincare cream but it's 20,000 000 like no one's going to buy that but that's very rarely the case I'm going to assume most of you price your products at something relative to your industry so let's not Bame in on the price quite yet if anything you should probably be charging more which you can when you use this so you can say I have a sales video here and everything like that and um all you have to do is just go to H highs.com and hus results if you want to see this page just Google it but what do I do here I make the case in a very short video you can see this sales video right here by most standards is pretty Dam damn short it's like 6 minutes most people like 20 minute videos or whatnot and really the call to action in this video is within the first minute and a half what this really is because I don't expect people to watch seven minutes of ads I expect them to watch maybe the first minute so really what I want them to do and the whole entire pitch is made in the first minute you can go watch this video if you want or my video uh sales page scripts are all already on this channel then what do I do I just spend the entire page proving that it works because really people don't need to be sold too much on the features or what it does or all the things about it what they need to be convinced of it's it's going to get them the result they want and then we can figure out everything out out else out on the sales page or then they're going to go if you're not doing call funnels which not every bu business should do a call funnel they're going to go and investigate on the rest of the site now armed with the fact that you really get the result that they want and you have the person in the buying situation right now if they want this result and you do a good enough job explaining the rest of site they're going to buy they're going to book that call so you can see right here all I'm doing is one smothering them with well-known Brands and then showing them just Our Endless amount of customers that are getting results and then focusing when I use the customer results right here what I do is I highlight the money Parts okay all these videos right here what we focus on is money okay so you can see we've even gone and cut these ads down to the parts where the person's talking purely about money money money why because look as as great as our customer support is and as great as everything we do at high resist the only thing you care about is more money and so that's going to be the thing that gets people in the calls I don't talk about how our our highrisk exension tracks phone calls or shows them better which by the way I mean look at this one ad set right here 39 calls tracked by Harris 19 calls tracked by Facebook if I was running Facebook ads right here and only using Facebook tracking I'd have no idea where my calls are coming from I don't understand how you're going to buy ads effectively if you don't know where 50% of your sales are coming from but whatever just just keep running ads without tracking it's fine soft hyro shill I know but we're just going to smash them over the head with results and then what are we going to do after this we're going to complete the trifecta because I'm going to assume that when a person first clicks this result ad they're probably on their phone or something and I don't think people they don't they don't book calls as much as they do from phones and they they don't buy as much from phones as they should or maybe they were in a place where they didn't have their card ready they weren't ready to buy at that time so what we're finally going to do is when people come to this result page right here okay they come to the result page we're going to retarget them with more testimonials and video ads so when a person comes here what I'm going to start doing is hitting them with demo videos more results ads testimonials so what I do that's really effective is we take all of our customers testimonials are based around money and we cut out the 5-second 3 second Clips to where they're talking about money and then we just layer them on top of themselves for 60 seconds so it's just like I made money I made money I made money and you want to do the same thing for whatever your prodct the skincare is like I cured my acne I cured my acne if you have that gym short company I talk about like my balls are plastic free my balls are plastic free I don't have Aids in my balls anymore my balls fantastic wonderful experience I no longer piss blood um anyways you get the point and so this type of funnel strategy right here works like Gang Busters because it focus on the two things that people uh need to buy your product which is attention which We Gather and ability to Target them and then brutally absolutely harassing them with results you do these three things right here and then you make a pretty good do you just do a basically good job on the rest of your website the rest like the rest of your business by the way your product should work I if a lot of people are going to mess me like but Alex what if everybody uses their prodct and gets no results what do we do then [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you I don't have time for this we got to get those results all right so you got to build a business that actually works and so this is the strategy I've been using it's so simple it's so dumb it works like crazy I mean this is this is this builds everything you could just do this like don't do anything complicated just do this now if you want to see the funnels that I'm using here link below in this video or at the end of the video you want to see the ad copy and the ad script I'm using link below or at the end of this video you want to see how I get all those testimonials there's a link in the description at the end of this video everything I know about advertising I just give away for free on this channel because I don't have info courses or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to sell you I just want you to make more money from your ads and then think to yourself wow I like way more money maybe I should track my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ads and see where my sales are coming on from so I can get them more cheaply and effectively instead of wasting tons of money on ads guessing and then maybe you'll use hyro so that's my thesis but don't stress about that just browse around the channel get some over the good content and juicy goodness apply the stuff make more money from your ads and uh subscribe and then I'll I'll come back and see you next video and we'll talk about some more ad stuff also by the way like 90% of you viewing this channel you're interested in ads but 90% plus of you are not subscribed this channel absolutely F when it comes to ads seriously there's no one on YouTube that has more access to ad data or actively not just running ads but also actively building the businesses the ads go through there's no one that's going to give you better information than me when it comes to getting people to clicky clicky your ads on the internet and then get them to buy your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so why don't you subscribe because I release a video every week and they're pretty good and I don't sell you anything I don't have an info product or some course or Mastermind or coaching program I'll just tell you what I'm doing so uh subscribe it's a good place to be [Music]
