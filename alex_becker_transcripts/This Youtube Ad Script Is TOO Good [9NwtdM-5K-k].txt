================================================================================

hey what's up this is Alex Becker CEO of hi rose I'm just gonna cut straight with you right here I want to do business with you in the future and so I'm gonna do something kind of sneaky right here and just deliver massive value to look as a CEO of a big tracking company I have a pretty big advantage on knowing what's gonna work in ads I've also used that to scale multiple businesses that I own to seven and even past eight figures so I know a thing or two so I'm just gonna tell you what I know and I'm gonna give you some of my best tactics that I've used that I think are absolutely essential my ads the first thing I'm gonna give you right now is actually a YouTube ad script I've been forced to use for the past five years and the reason why I say forced to use is because I've tried every other type of script every type of filming scenario I've tried to do everything else under the Sun to get away from the script cuz it's so basic and so simple but nothing gets me customers as efficiently or cheaply as the script I'm forced to use it and if you can find something that beats it please let me know but this script right here this one ad is responsible for selling over 8200 high ticket courses I was able to sell over 18,000 subscriptions at my software company and I've used this consulting I've uses in services I've used this in everything this thing just absolutely crushes it and I think one of the best ways I can help you is just giving you this script and showing you how it works so you can use it on your YouTube ads and that's it now also if any point in this video you want to actually track your YouTube ads you should go below and hit the purple button we will go and show you exactly how to track this because AdWords tracking isn't isn't gonna be that accurate because of a lot of things that hold it back and you're gonna end up killing the ads that are making you money and investing in ads that are not making you money which is a double whammy and while you're watching this video if you think yourself I'm not Homer sent sure I need tracking right now but I'd love to see this funnel did you scale to eight figures I'd love to see how it works I realize I left you hang in there just click the green button below it's a complete train it shows you the exact ads the exact funnel even the copywriting targeting I use to scale one of my businesses to eight figures just using YouTube ads and the script that well I'm just gonna show you right now let's dive into it okay so we're first going to do is we're going to breakdown this script it's very simple and I'm actually going to show you myself executing this script and so there's a few things we need to understand the script has a few different parts and it all goes around one key aspect which is our promise now no matter what niche you're in there has to be a promise that hooks people there has to be something that gets people from point A to point B there has to be something they're seeking that is going to motivate them to click the ad opt in and do all the things that you're requesting to do which at the very end it requires me to take out a credit card or hop on a phone call even that's a lot there has to be something they really want in order to get them do that now your promise on your niche will be found in many different ways and usually you can find this with ads and the headlines of your opt-ins but at the basic level what people want is to avoid pain or avoid pain that they're already in or get excessive gain or get again without the things they hate so for example at high roast when I run add to that the entire promise is how to make significantly more and save significantly more from your business by pressing a button that's that's essentially what the promises without doing anything okay so if you go and see a lot of my ads that are running what we offer them is hey how you can go and save fifteen percent of your ad spend and scale twenty percent further just by activating this pixel AI training it's a very simple promise and that's a huge hook now I'm not going to get into how to design the opt-in this video but the thing I want to point out right there is you notice how I didn't mention sales attribution and say how you can use tracking to not waste money on ads and then make a bit more money from your ads because it also doesn't sound mysterious and so what you want to do is you want to think of what your promise is and then put it in a way to present it as a new opportunity this is absolutely essential to your ad so for example when I've run products for my old e-commerce training business what we do is we wouldn't say hey how to build a shop by store really quickly and start a business around that make money we'd say how we're taking advantage of a new opportunity in import exporting that allowed us to build a business that X in this amount of time without any tech skills without any experience you see how I wrapped the promise up which is essentially how you can build a business quickly without any tech skills without the things you hate but we presented as a new opportunity that's the absolute key to running good ads if you do not have a good promise that is easy and based around instant gains and removal of instant pains without the things they hate and it doesn't seem like a new opportunity it's not gonna hit as well okay so that's why when you're running your ads first off the number one thing you want to do is don't use the lingo that's an industry use the lingo that separates your offer because then people are gonna be curious about they're gonna want to click it then you need to nail down you need to understand that people in general this isn't this applies every person even even all the way up to Tony Robbins to a person that lives in a shack and 95% of things in our life we want the short path without effort I can look at my washing machine right now I have no idea how that thing works and if it required me to push 16 different buttons I probably have some really dirty dishes I look at my refrigerator I don't care how that thing works that is 100 years of engineering right there in my corner I don't give a damn and you need to understand you need to stop looking at your offers then in a special light or expecting people to take an extra effort if you have an offer for example Tyros I know people don't give a damn about tracking all people want to do is not lose money on their ads so I'm gonna swing at that I'm gonna try make it as push a button as possible it's the same thing with weight loss people don't want to learn discipline in a strong diet they want to press a button and lose weight without the things they hate okay for example attracting the things that people hate and the reason why people haven't gone and subtracting is they believe it's massive pain it takes coding skills it takes all sorts of crazy step-by-step it's just impossible to set up it's not worth the effort and even if you put in tons of time it's still not gonna be right that's the things they hate okay when people are thinking about starting a business the thing they hate is that they think they need tech skills they think they're gonna need to lose a lot of money they think they're gonna have to dedicate 20 hours a day when people want to lose weight they think they're gonna have to stop eating their favorite foods they think they're going to have to exercise three to four hours you're gonna notice all the best ads play to this hey get all the things you want without the things you hate and then they present as a new opportunity so very important so here's exactly how the ad script works there's multiple parts there's the first five seconds then there's the next 30 seconds and you're gonna watch me do this I'll have links to some of my best converting ads below as well then there's gonna be a five second part right here there's gonna be a thirty second part right here and there's gonna be another five second part right here and I want to walk you through what all these are so we're gonna start off an ad on YouTube you notice there's that five seconds then the person clicked through what I like to call this first so I have five seconds is your state your business okay so what a lot of people do on their ads it's a giant mistake as I try to get attention you really don't want the attention of people whose attention you don't want so I like this ID and it took them about ten seconds to actually state what that is about we're not running ads for coca-cola here usually when we're going to be running ads on YouTube we're trying to extract an audience we're not trying to sell to the biggest audience possible and for example one of my one of my proxies I scaled past eight figures cells to a huge audience but even that audience compared to the general amount of people that are on earth would only be about two out of a hundred people okay that's still a huge audience but you need to keep in mind that we want to get everybody everybody who's not interested in what we have to sell off the ad and we want to get everybody who is interested instantly hooked on the ad so what you need to do is you need to state your business and what we do is we make some type of curiosity peaking statement where a person wants the explanation it's based around our product or we even call out the person so for example the beginning of my hire us ads that you're gonna see I say do you run ads well if so this should terrify you you know who that doesn't terrify everybody doesn't run ants nobody doesn't want to add skips that ad okay because I know it's about I stated my business if I've served my Jairo sadness I started it off of like man this has been the key to everything for me this helped me build this big giant house this has been absolutely amazing I'd get so many people watching that have nothing to do with that I don't want to do that so you want to state your business at one of my consulting programs we help people grow their business with YouTube ads at the be end that ad I say this is you on Facebook ads or is your business stuck okay it's it's very clear what the ad is about and I believe I start another ad with this sold 18,000 SAS subscriptions for me an eighty two hundred high ticket procs anybody who's not selling anything online is gonna instantly be repulsed by that ad so I instantly get the people hook that I want and kick up all the other ones see what's gonna happen is if you start it with just attention seeking what's gonna happen is the people that you might actually want to watch that might not watch it because I don't think it's irrelevant they think it's not relevant to them so they're just gonna click that five second button and what you need to realize about YouTube traffic it's extremely broad it's extremely broad so it's more about extracting the audience so what's gonna happen is the people that you want to watch it might bounce off and the people that you don't want to watch it might watch then something you just got a disaster so that's the first thing then in the next 30 seconds you need to tell a story that shows this promise being fulfilled that ties into the first five seconds so what I'll do and my Huayra sad they'll say hey if you run ads this should terrify you because when I work with clients they're attribution is off by this much and here's exactly what happens this happens this happens this happens this happened in my business and I actually pressed this button or with proper attribution I solved all these problems so I show how my promise is being completed at my ecommerce training business I used to run we would start the ad by saying this is so-and-so he got these results in this time frame right here and he got these results by doing this weird thing with importing and exporting from China and so what he was able to do is do this did this and that and he was able to get this result lost off another ad saying this is how Instagram fluent sirs make money a sneaky way Instagram influencers make money hook and then I explained how it works which is through e-commerce marketing and how they did it and then I say if you want to learn ecommerce marketing click here so what I do is I show the promise being fulfilled you need to explain the situation went more so discuss your promise and all the things that they want without the things I hate so for example this is so-and-so they got this result they did this without XY and Z and they disobey taking advantage of this new opportunity and they did it in this timeframe they did it very quickly that applies to almost every every ad out there b2b b2c it doesn't really matter people want to result quickly and they want without the things they hate then in this five seconds right here what we're going to do is we're going to do the call to action say click here that I can't explain it all in this ad there's no way I could give you all the information needed for this ad so what you need to do is click this ad it's going to take you to a page where you'll be able to opt in will you'll be able to get more information yada-yada this is where we go for the click then what we can do in this next 30 seconds since we basically want to show then in the next 30 seconds what we want to do is we want to really hammer on benefits without the things they hate if you cool this out you're gonna see this you're gonna see how to save a ton of money on your ads instantly I'm gonna show you how to scale your ads and more importantly in just a few seconds you'll be able to optimize your pixely I had to find customers faster just like this person just like this person just like this person so use benefits without and then show the results of your customers and then we're gonna call for the click again this ad script right here I've use on YouTube for almost three years now I've spent millions and millions and millions of dollars of the script nothing defeats it nothing the feats it so what I want to do right now this let's actually watch one of my ads and all you'll see me doing this exact script from absolute scratch let's do this one this is one of my best converting ads at high rose right now okay so we're gonna go over one of my most successful ads at high rose and we're gonna kind of break down the script as we go through it together the thing I want to stress right now is that the template of the script always remains the same what's being said what's being angled to what's being promised will change there's no one-size-fits-all for what to say in this in this time frame the main thing is you state your business you show your promise being a cheat via story via results you express the result the person's looking for your big promise that you're using to lure them through the funnel you express that and show that being completed you show that result being there you present the problem and provide a solution in that next 30 seconds then we go for the call-to-action then we basically repeat the process that works over and over and over again now what's gonna be promised and that way it's gonna be presented is going to change over time so let's go through the ad real quick and I'll break this down so first thing I want to do is remember state your business if your business buys ads I can almost guarantee that your sales tracking is off by 30 to 40 percent ok cool I've stated my business who's this ad for people that buy ads who's this ad not for people don't buy ads okay if you're looking if you're looking to buy poodle's online this ad is not going to get your attention this this is repulsed everybody who's not my target market at this point in time I've stated my business now I need to illustrate the problem and the promise that I'm offering the person whether it's a way out of pain or a way to gain and I need any illustrate that being solved or I need to illustrate that problem being fixed if they click this ad and I mean guarantee and frankly should terrify you because I work with businesses at high rows every single day they were spending one thousand five thousand even thirty thousand dollars per day across the board the default is their sales tracking is off by thirty to forty percent this isn't rocket science when this happens one you're gonna turn off ads that are actually profitable this happens all the time and this is like giving yourself an inner case so what am i doing right here I'm presenting a big problem the whole promise of this ad is if you click here we'll be able to fix this problem so what I'm doing in this point right here in the story is I'm telling a story that causes a madam a large amount of pain illustrates the pain that they're probably in and then I offer solution out of that if we're doing a gain focused ad we'd make an ad where we're presenting the massive amount of gain through results or success that other people are having or you've had and we say hey look if you want to see how this works go here so we're presenting either massive gain and the promises if I click this ad they'll be able to see how this massive gain works or we're presenting massive pain telling a story that illustrates this and then going from there motion every single month to you're gonna spend money on ads that aren't actually making you money thus losing ten to fifteen percent of your ad spend and then when the ad platforms can't see the correct data they optimize around the wrong data this results in their targeting being less efficient and you having to spend way more to get a customer the result of this is hamstringing your business by 20% and then also wasting ten to fifteen percent of your ad spend that's five to six figures lost every year that you don't have to because you can click this ad and see that's how it is we present we present the promise through a story after doing our stating our business we present two promise as a story basically this is what's either happening to you this is what other was happened to other people or this is how this is the explanation for the big statement I just made in the state your business section do a basic story illustrating the results or lack of results or pain and then what we do is we do a call to action training that will show you step-by-step how to fix this in literal minutes and I've done this for nearly a hundred businesses I've done this for large businesses like Dean grows always mastermind calm I've done this for huge brands like groove life I've done this for e-commerce business okay so then what we do is we tell again in the next thirty seconds as we tell more stories these could be results these could be additional benefits but we want to go and tell additional things that back up that if they click this ad this is what they're gonna get okay whether it's hey I've done I've done this for other businesses hey here's more results hey in this training you're gonna see exactly this this and this and you want to hyper dig into the things you want to double down maybe on the gain or the pain and the in that they're gonna be able to escape out of it but abouts how it's going to work her info businesses I've done this for businesses where it's based around sales calls look if you're running ads on a good day your data is gonna be off by thirty to forty percent if you're not actively trying to find ways to solve this problem I will show you how to fix this problem in the little minutes if you cook this ad and I'm not exaggerating when I say taking a few minutes to just watch the hyper quick training I'm trying to get you to watch right here will save you five to six figures this year because think about it take the ad spin you spend every single month okay now take ten okay again I'm just making them count the money at this point that they're losing in this ad it's very simple it's very simple that's the same exact way that I'm gonna run every single script I'm going to start off state your business thirty seconds story that illustrates your state your business statement whether and you want to achieve massive potential gain are you are err you want to show massive potential gain for little effort or massive pain in a way out of pain with little effort as well so telling a story about how other people have done that telling a story about how you've done that going over to numbers and stats that you see that back up what you see these are great ways to achieve this these are great ways to push the person through that that's a great way to tell a story and so that's what you want to achieve you want to either show massive gain without the things they hate massive pain are escape from pain without the things they hate which you in that instance what you want to do is cause pain and then show a way out of the pain by clicking the add you want to make your call to action and then you want to double down on the benefits showing more results that your users or customers of Godin I an explaining or doubling down on the pain or gain that they can get into so this is an example right here I talked about results and then I talked about how much money to losing adding pain and I talked about again how easy would be to fix that it click this ad so basically state your business tell a story that illustrates the big promise that you're pruning people through that brings people through your funnel call to action illustrate the benefits the pains the results over again do another call to action okay that's all I'm doing right here and you can see again at the end of that 15 percent of the paycheck and just give it back just throw it away and then take the other 30 percent and blow it on pokemon cards it's disturbing I don't like watching it so I'm begging you just click to sad watch the hyper cook training and we'll fix your tracking just like all the businesses you're about to see it okay and so then what we're gonna do at the end of that I did a final call to action and then what I do is I show what I like to do at the end of a YouTube ad is you want to just have a screen that shows results or testimonies you don't want the ad to just end you want the ad to have a clear ending where you can see for this minute right here it just shows these results okay so the user clearly knows that the ad is done I clearly know what the ad is done and then it's time to click and you want to have this because a lot of people just watch the ad to the end and and we'll end and start that video then they can't get back to the ad so have a good 30 seconds where the person needs to click and if you follow this template right here not every ad is gonna be a homerun but this consistently works for me when I've gone off this script that gets really nasty really quick and the CP LS when I follow this type of script works like crazy and so usually my ads are never really ever gonna perform super poorly but maybe one of the five - what if five is gonna perform really really well what I eventually want to do is I want to have about 15 ads that I've created and I want to select my top I don't know three to five that have performed really well and then make those my main ad so I'll run all over the place so it takes time to build up all those ads but that's how you want to run this so that being said this is my ad script this is the script I use for all my ads again if you want help tracking your ads again
