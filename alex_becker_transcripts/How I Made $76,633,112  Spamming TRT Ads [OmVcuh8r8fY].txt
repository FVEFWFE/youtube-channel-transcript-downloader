so do you run ads but you're a degenerate lazy piece of you don't want to put any effort into it you want your ads to just convert despite you using the same ad images the same text and copy heck you can just throw it in AI pop it out just throw that diarrhea all over Facebook and you use the world's ugliest landing pages and you still convert at crazy amounts does that sound good to you of course it does because you know why you're a degenerate piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but I like you like putting absolutely no effort into my ad so what I'm going to show you in this video is actually something that allowed me to put almost no effort into my ads and take my business from zero to over $30 million per while keeping my ad cost very low that is on about $3,000 A Day In AD spend the returns I get on my ads are absolutely alarming they make everybody else's ad spend look small beta and very non- Giga Chad and I'm going to give this technique to you and then you can just use it forever and and forget everything you know about sales copywriting landing pages and just do this cuz it works so much better it makes your ads convert so so so much higher in fact when I've given this to people with with their ads even if they're semi beginners it's allowed them to just stop doing everything else just focus on this and their business grows and their ads are instantly almost guaranteed profitable because this is just that damn effective and this is what I like to call the testimonial letter now like other videos I like to try and keep these short if you want to see the ad targeting for this the way I actually make money and monetize this there'll be links to those at the end of this video also in the description you should check those out cuz that's the entire part of the system and as a added benefit I have no course to sell you because I've actually made a ton of money already doing this I'm just Sly adding you to a remarketing list for hyos right now so I just give away everything on this channel so you can grow your ads and then when you're like hey I'd like to make more money for my ad I'll just add hyros in and then you'll make 15 20% more like that which will be proven to you in this video as well but hyos isn't required for this in fact being an intelligent individual not required for this at all you can be a baboon level ad Runner and you'll beat everybody and it's using what I like to call the testimonial ladder using this simple pattern allowed us to take hyros from 0 to $30 million per year it allow to take info businesses from0 to $10 million per year I've seen this work and actually just works everywhere because it's the base of how to get people to do what you want so what exactly is this let me explain the testimonial louder process is simply a process of getting testimonials from people and then using those testimonials get larger testimonies for more repal people and then advertising it and then repeating that process over and over again till the world ends now this sounds really simple it's advertise your testamental yeah but you have to understand how to do this in a specific way and if you do this in a spef specific way your business will start from absolute scratch to working its way up to getting the largest testimonials in the industry from the biggest names and then once you have that you really don't need much else you can mess up everything else but if you have the biggest names in an industry saying hey this works and then hundreds of testamental is also saying this works you don't need to do anything else let me explain so how does this work it essentially involves getting early testimonials for your product and then using that to stack other testimonials let me explain so very early on my career when I was a stage 10 scumbag I would be launching procs on the warrior Forum now you have to be about 60 years old to uh remember what the warrior form is this is back when you actually had to learn how to do internet marketing on your own it was the Wild Wild West cowboy days of it and uh so what I would do is I go in these forums and everybody had these really long form copy Pages they have all this stuff convincing you to buy their little scammy scuzzy project and I was like hm I I think the better way to do this would actually be to a make a product at works first this is one of the first requirements is but two what I would instead do instead of making these long copies and trying to persuade people to do it I would just go and get testimonies from 20 30 people I would give them the product the product would work they'd leave a testimoni and I just make pages with hundreds and hundreds of testimonal on and then people would buy that was that was literally the only copy on the page it' be a little Snippets headlines and typical stuff then hundreds of testimonials and so what I started doing for all of my businesses is I would go and launch the business I get testimonials and I would advertise those testimonials and I would stack the testones up to a large obnoxious amount and then just advertise that and this allowed me to absolutely crush it in info marketing making tens of millions of dollars per year but when this really took off is when I started sniper focusing this to get larger testimonals and larger testimonals and piggyback it and then use that to take over an entire industry so let me explain to you how I did this in info marketing and hyos and you can kind of see how to do this in your industry so when I launched hyos for example a the product works if you put hyos onto your ads with a combination of print tracking and a optimization you simply make 15 to 20% more from your ads this is proven this is factual we have a 90-day guarantee on it that if a person comes on and their ads do not scale they don't make more money from it they don't pay for it because it just simply works so that's the first Barone thing you got to do the next thing you want to do is when you launch your product you need to find your first Core 10 power customers these are people that really want to use your product and you just give it to them for free now if nobody wants to use your product even though you give it away for free you probably don't have the right product Market fit and I'll talk about that in an entire other video Let's imagine you have a lot of people that actually want to use your product and they get results from it you get these 10 people on board and then you get them to leave 10 testimonials okay specifically you want to get these people in the same industry so if I'm doing info marketing or marketing my product at hyos to agencies that run ads for info businesses what I did is I went and got 10 info agencies and I let them use it for free and I should I showed them hey you plug this into your ads it makes more money they plugged into their ads they made more money so then what I use that for is to then run ads to pages that had all their testimonials on this and I use this to start getting more agencies and businesses similar to them in the info space in but here's where it gets very very interesting once you have this amount of testimonials what this allows you to do if your product is unique in a market space for example if you have a product that everybody else has you're going to have a hard time getting really big well-known people to use it but if you have a product that is unique you can basically reach out to businesses large well-known businesses and offer it to them for free free get them results and then simply ask for a testimonial so what we did at our business is I took these testimonials we initially had to start getting my initial customers from ads that's that's literally all I did I got 10 testimonials and I ran a simple sales page with a video and these 10 testimonials and book a call but where this really turned in the fire is when I took these 10 testimonials and I reached out to specific agencies so for example I reached out to Tony Robins Ad Agency I reached out to clickfunnels I reached out to Big names like Sam ovens in our Grant card in fact if you just go look at hris we have testimonals from basically everyone in the infom marketing space why because what I did is I reached out to these businesses starting from maybe a smaller tier so I'd find a really big well-known person in the infom marketing space let's say Dan Henry okay Dan is a little bit more private back in the day but this person was pretty big in the industry okay so then what I do is I get results for Dan Henry for example and then I use that to reach out to someone who was at a little bit higher level and say hey we just got him results right here do you want to try this out out I can pretty much guarantee it work you come on for free if it does work for you you just leave a testimonial and so we use this to go higher and higher up to the point where we were working with the biggest names in the industry and then we'd use one testimonial from a big name in Industry to lure around another person so for example we got Grant Cardone results with hyros you got his ad team results with hyros and then we reached out to Tony Robbins ad team and we slowly started getting all these big names on hyros simply by doing that and then collecting a testimonial then what do you think I did once I had those testimonials all we did is we started running ads to our website focusing on these testimonials so for example check out this page right here okay you can see it's just an obnoxious level of results across the entire industy now hus does so much more outside of info now so we have testimon from everybody SAS companies like click phonos Playboy and e-commerce influencers and e-commerce I don't want you to focus on that right now because this applies to the same thing if I'm doing it in e-commerce I'm doing it in SAS right now I'm going to repeat this process in any business that I'm doing but then what I would do is I'd run ads with these testimonials and then send people to Pages like this it is just an endless page of results that our business has gotten because the only thing that people really care about and the only thing that people really believe is results and convincing results from people that they know in an industry you don't just want to grab random testimonials you want to grab targeted testimonials from Big names and well-known people and then you show them the endless congol line of results you've gotten for more normal or less well-known businesses and you just keep it coming you keep stacking you keep stacking and keep stacking it then you start to pitch and you can see at the bottom of this page we just have a simple booking form that's it this page has almost no copywriting on it it is just endless results I've ran this page in a format on clickfunnels that's very very very ugly much worse looking than this and it actually worked better than this good-looking page now of course we want to have other parts of our site we want to you know have other features and things that are going on in our business but this is really what it takes and then once you have the big names in your industry well here's how you expand the business even more you use those big names in your industry to springboard in other Industries so for example we're working like with a big brand like Playboy we go and show them all the testimonies we got from Big names and infom marketing say hey this will work in e-commerce for you use it repeat the process then use that to get more testimonials in e-commerce what about SAS same thing we're doing right now at hus right now for SAS working with clickfunnels got click funnel results show other SAS companies start building a Rolodex of SAS companies same thing with a agencies find big well-known agencies in their agency space repeat that process and you use this process to keep expanding the business endlessly because again all we're doing is we're getting testimonials we're using those testimonials to get bigger testimonials then we advertise the bigger testimonials with all the smaller testimonials underneath them and this can be essentially all your ads boil down to this is such a simple stupid concept that allows you to run ugly landing pages basic advertising and get Superior results to pretty much everyone else in your industry you can stop focusing on making really high all the ads and having the world's best meta Tik Tok YouTube targeting advertising management you can just focus on this and then the final snippet to why this really works really well is eventually everyone in your industry or in the niche you're targeting just starts to see these testimonials all the all over the place all the time and they're going to think of your business whenever they do actually want to become a customer now with this if you want to see how to actually run the ads the scripts for this I have my YouTube ad script my exact ad scripts right here I have how I monetize it right here and I have the type of products I like like to sell best with this type of funnel right here this is all the information you need I have nothing else to say to you go browse around the channel learn some more young Padawan I'll see you in the next video
