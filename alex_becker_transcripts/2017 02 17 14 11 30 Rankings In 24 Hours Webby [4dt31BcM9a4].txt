live this is totally live because I'm gonna like burp like five times but guys I like to start every webinar by telling every single person in the webinar and I don't know why this slide is right here Greg is not on this webinar but I have to tell everybody here look if you follow one of these categories you might have to just leave the webinar because you're taking someone else's seat if you're a skeptical don't do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tire kicker if everything I tell you in this webinar you're not going to go out there and apply this webinar is not going to benefit you and you're just basically wasting my time and your time being here so just leave if your mind is locked in some unchangeable SEO Theory and you're going to question every live ranking and all the proof I showing this webinar you're a dick just get out like don't be one of those people I don't have time for you you don't even have time for this go do something that benefits your life and if you're on Facebook right now

to rank sites for terms in as little as 30 minutes now what we're also going to show you to do is how to make and monetize these terms with super high payout methods we're basically going to show you to make a network of these types of terms that generates a full-time income passively now before we get into this guys I don't like using using the word p the word passive income it's a real Buzz word for me because a lot of people get into internet marketing seeking a way not to work if you're trying to start a business and your goal is not to work it's kind of an oxymoron it doesn't work out I'm going to show you guys a way to kill it if you bust your butt in this webinar it's extremely easy to do that can bring you in passive income that being said I don't support that type of mindset you need to be going after and when you see this webinar you shouldn't be thinking I can sit around and play World of Warcraft all day should be thinking I'm going to go kill the world this helps me a very quick into to Theo webinar we're going to be in and out about 30 minutes because you have stuff to do I have stuff to do so and what you're going to see in this webinar is going to be very cool and in fact what you're going to see is and what you're going to know how to do is you're going to know how to rank sites in the next two days you're going to know to rank about 30 sites first page in the next two days and exactly how to monetize them you're going to know how to make 60,000 a deer off of the easiest terms on planet Earth through anybody in this inire Bernar regardless of where you are and your SEO skills can go out there and rank for these terms on top of that you're going to see and know to be you're going to know how to go out there and rank for hundreds of terms in any day you choose okay and that that sentence right there doesn't you'll be able to rank for hundreds of these terms a day okay let me back up we're actually going to show you in this webinar how you can go out there and rank for hundreds of these terms in a day if you choose and I'm actually going to show you a way to blow clients Minds with this and make it much more likely that they sign on and work with you you're also going to know how to sell the traffic from these terms for as much as $400 per lead and I'm going to show you a tactic that almost guarantees clients join you and allows you to get them really fast results and actually get them business and more people coming in to justify the amount you charge your clients every single month and I'm also going to show you to automate the entire process now how many people here I have a question for you if you simply had ano tactic that worked and was rinse and repeat and you could just do over and over and over again give me one if you think you could probably scale that the fulltime if every time you did this tactic it added $60 a month to your income give me one if you think you could probably scale that to $5,000 a month just Brute Force just sit at your computer for five hours straight there you go everybody should be hitting one that's actually most people people's dream a lot of people get into internet marketing it's not that they're afraid to work it's just stuff they're doing isn't rinse or repeat it's not something you can scale it's not something you can grow it's just wishy-washy and all over the place but guys we just agreed right here like let's say you really had a tactic that every day you do this it adds around $60 a month to your income could you patiently do this and scale this to $6,000 a month that would take you about a 100 days at this pace the scale to that level and I think everybody here could do that and the goal of this webinar is to give you just that it's going to show you exactly how to go out there and give you a rinse and repeat tactic that is easy to monetize and you can go out there and use over and over and over again now guys what I like to do in every single SEO webinar there's a lot of people I'm sure have been into events watch some Blog watch some guy actually just watched some video this was not Ty Lopez I like Ty a lot but there some I watched some video of some guy on YouTube he's waking up in some giant mansion talking about how great his SEO rankings are he didn't show a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ranking he didn't show a single ranking they can't be that great but give me next if you've ever experienced that and it's just like that that drives me nuts that drives me bonkers guys I'm going to go through all these rankings I just talked about in the email but what I want to show you and you guys have seen give me one if you've already seen all the rankings Greg has you know we ranked number one for New York SEO you know we rank number one for all these competitive terms we show them every single webinar look if you've never been to one of our webinars before go attend one next week or what we saw in the replay before uh because it breaks down like 20 different competitive terms you rank for and if you want me to I'll even go over those at the end of the webinar we don't have any problems showing them live just what I'm going to show you is about 45 first page rankings so we don't necessarily have time for that so what I decide to do guys or what we talked about in the actual warmup for this webinar let me go look at this right here as I told you we were going to go out there and rank 30 sites for 30 different terms first page and we're going to do it in 24 hours so let's just do that I I told you guys we would do that live and I'm going to actually break this down for you step by step now a lot of these terms you're going to see you're going to be scratching your head how do we monetize these and in this webinar I'm going to show you not only how we rank these for in 20 hours actually about 30 minutes time every single one and how you can do this by the end of this webinar I'm also going to show you how to generate about $60,000 a year from these terms or more if you stick with it so let's just go through it what we're going to look on every single one of these pages is you're going to be looking for these little red boxes right here and so we did this by going and using a tool that I created called Source machine and I actually used my best outsourcer his named Superstar SEO I'll actually link to you to his gig on conquer I'm also going to show you guys a free way to do this but what we're going to show you right now is just these rankings and so yesterday I hit him up and said dude let's load up Source machine let's go get 30 of these rankings he said cool about an hour later he's like all right we're done we're all ranking first page so let's just go through it so here's one right here myle Beach fire damage repair that's about like 10,000 5,000 or more dollars per job you can see right there ranked number one or not not ranked first page 20 hours you can see here Plano marketing Plano video marketing Services ranked number one in 19 hours you can see Taber City Gardener ranked number one in 18 hours you can see bennettville Mobile Mechanic rank number one 18 hours most of these videos actually took 30 minutes to rank you can just see that's is when they were uploaded you got little river fence company 18 hours you got Li River home security specialist 17 hours you got btown Tyle and Gro number three 17 hours you got pool care right here 17 hours uh I'm not even going to say 178 hours more got Cherry Grove mowing company solar panel installation uh calage podiatrist ranked on the first page right there one day Timmonsville dry cleaner right there Pageland SEO number one this will at least get him probably another client this year uh you can see neology position right there actually I think that's just a random term I threw in you can see Clarin and B bonds first page right there you can see Loris email marketing you can see boom jumped up right there you can see mer inal mold removal you can see boom right here on the first page if we keep on going this is getting a lot you're going to see ply eyes water damage repair you can see this right here first number one actually uh uploaded yesterday and I'm actually show you make a killing with terms like this an absolute [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] killing now that also means said guys you're El going to are that what am I even saying just too many terms it confuses me I'm a simple guy anyways right here we got Lumberton life insurance company R first page right there vinyl floor installation drug counc in Whiteville I'm actually show you to make a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of money with terms like that too you can see drywall repair same exact first page right there you can see motorcycle repair boom right there uh light fixture repair number one right there uh root canal number one right there rhinoplasty right there A's Credit Union right there it just keeps going uh upholstery auto upholstery right there number two and practical ADC guide going on Safari and there is 30 rankings now the next thing I want to do right here is I want to answer to two questions you probably have the first off is do these rankings actually stick here's from the last time we do that me and Chris will just sit down we've done this multiple times for examples and you can see right here here's one we uploaded last time we were doing this ranked in 24 hours this is a divorce attorney term right here you can see this person right here we ranked it in November it is now number one in this giant box right here you can see kenology we ranked in November still number one drug addiction counselor right here still on the first page and you can see water damage right here on the first page now guys how many people give me an X if you're already aaz you think that's pretty damn cool yeah that's pretty damn cool so guys give me a why right now if you're going to scratch your head you think this is a neat trick but how the hell do we monetize this okay that's a reasonable question and guys I'm not like that guy who woke up in the house and just leaves you like with a bunch of questions I'm going to answer all your questions here's how we monetize this look at this n right here water damage repair now guys let's imagine we went out one day and we did exactly what we just did right here but for only water damage repair if we went out there and got 20 rankings for terms like this can we assume that would probably get us two phone calls over a month just two phone calls just two phone calls asking for water damage repair give me one if it probably would that's very reasonable very easy so guys here's exactly how we would go out there and monetize this we go over to offer Vault right here and we type in water damage we got flood fire and water damage and you can see right here they're paying $32 per phone call boom just like that guys we just added $60 a month to our income give me a big fat X if you just see that no we don't even have to rent the video we just put in a a a phone number that we'll call them we'll redirect to these people boom we're making $32 a phone call now guys that what I just showed you took Chris about 30 minutes to do imagine if Chris had sto there for three hours now many you give me a big fat one if you want to see exactly how we did that and go deeper into this you're excited now you got a big fat SEO boner okay cool awesome so let's get into how exactly we did this that was a general game plan that I just broke down we rank these for very easy terms and then we go after and we sell the phone calls we sell the leads to local businesses or to CPA offers now how do we do this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's actually really easy we just press a few buttons so the things we need to do this job okay and I'm using a lot of pictures in webinar okay this this is actually Link from Zelda and this is this is him discovering a source wave I like to think or it's or it's or it's a child in a skirt whatever you want to put it into um so anyways what we need to do this is we need a YouTube video that's easy we also need a video that looks a little bit something like this except in this video we want to make it maybe a little bit more PR uh professional and we might want to leave like a review or maybe like an actor or someone like saying hey man this if you want the best services this is actually where I went it's really good it's super simple and guys only way to do that it's so easy is you just go on over to conquer and all you're going to go over is you're going to go to the video section on conquer right here and you're simply just going to pay some going to make you a video see done for you animated local lead gen videos there you go easy as pie so that's done video is done now we're also going to need is we're going to need a few other dummy videos and so what we could basically do is make a bunch of videos that look like this so let me go back over here they look like this one okay and we just upload a bunch of them to YouTube you just change the time stamps on them and you just upload them across a bunch of channels on YouTube give me an X if you can do that that's pretty damn easy awesome all right so the next thing we're going to need is we're going to need a to tracking service and a website if we want we don't necessarily need a website for this um but let's just get in so call tracking all we're going to do to do that is we're going to go to Google and we're going to type in call tracking service and we're going to go get a troll tracking service for I think it's it's they're super cheap all right let me just look at the pricing right here okay so there's there's cheaper ones than this you could probably get this for much cheaper you can probably actually get a few phone numbers for free if you're starting out um but there's much much cheaper Services than car but you just get a simple called tracking service and what this does is when someone calls the phone number in your video it redirects that phone number to whoever you direct it to and you can track it give me one if you can do that I might even start a call tracking service that seems like a next good thing for Source wave I don't know uh that actually seems like a really good idea uh anyways so the next thing we're going to need guys is we're going to need an embeddable high Authority Network this is basically a network of web 2.0's and YouTube videos we can bet on to really quick so I'm going to show you to do that so the first thing we're going to do guys is we're going to pick a bunch of suburbs in our Niche now guys I could explain the what's the the Gen this this the right stuff the good stuff behind picking the right Niche but it's actually really easy you just pick a suburb and a longtail term okay you just pick a very small suburb and that's it you can go from there and we're going to give you a big list of suburbs um at the end of this webinar and a bunch of nich you can do this in specifically ones you can just sell the CPA offers so we're just going to pick our Target let's say our Target right here is water damage so let's go look at um let's see is this the one right here let's say let's say our yeah I want to I'm going to do water damage in this one because people don't believe me when I talk about how much money you can make in drug addiction guys if you go and look right here the normal pay per lead for drug addiction is like $300 I'm not going to talk about this webinar because the the numbers like get so stupidly High I'm like dude you just rank 50 videos you can make like 10K a month people like get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of here I'm like but you really can but so we're gonna narrow it down we're going to talk about water damage that's going to be the example I'm going to use in this webinar because I actually have a friend who sells so many water damage leads so I kind of know it pretty well so what we do guys is we go and pick a term like water damage repair and fire damage repair those are really good ones right there and so we're going to go find a bunch of suburbs like poly Island all sorts of stuff like that just go to any state print out a list of every single suburb in the state okay so then we're going to do is we're going to upload our video to YouTube and it's going to be watched by a bunch of people uh who work at the Yavin 4 base uh this is kind of this is where they actually review the videos that they're put on YouTube I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you not okay i' I've been there this is what it looks like um this is actually they actually uploaded the Death Star plans in Rogue one to YouTube spoiler alert uh but anyways you upload your video to YouTube and then what we do guys is we either go out there and we link to our video from other videos or we simply just go out there and embed our videos all over the internet using a tool that I have called Source machine so I'm going to show you the freeway first because I'm a nice guy and I'm not going to be a dick and show you how to go and do this without showing you and saying y you just had to buy so guys if you want to do this for free here's all you do after you put up a video you you go to all your dummy videos that you just made and you paste your link in the YouTube video it's a little bit timec consuming and it's very tedious okay give me a give me an X if you can do that okay now you know the free method let me show you the turbocharge method so what you do right here is after we upload the video and we put the title the keyword in the title and we put the key the keyword in the description you can see The Talented SEO that we're doing right here all we do is we simply go on over to Source machine so you can see literally what we just ranked right here we went up and I had Chris go and do this for me so what source machine does is it goes out there and then basically we just load up the machine and we go out there and we just pump up all these videos right here we just go and basically we do one or two things what I prefer to do is you go out there and this is going to get you to the first spot okay if you're just linking from other YouTube videos it's going to be a little bit slower you might not see the instant results and you might get to the half like the middle of the page most of the time you can see we hit the number one spot a lot of the times so what we would do here is I'd have Chris load this up and we basically go and look at all the spots right here that got posted out to so if you can see right here when we click right here we're going to go on over down to let's look at um this one right here okay so you can see what's going on right here and so you can see Chris loaded this up and he basically posted it to all these sources right here that we put into this Source machine account um there you can go out there and have a variety we just posted a ton to these sites right here and you see basically every single the video get gets put up instantly when it gets put up it gets embedded on like a hundred different websites you can see like what are we looking at right here literally the videos we just ranked give me a one if you just see like the videos we just ranked right here you're looking at here exactly you can see the links to the YouTube videos and everything sitting right there and so we go and post on all these websites Tumblr uh stumble Pon a lot of social media spots and if you really want to finish it up and guys this was a rush job you go out there and you then post it on social media sources you then go out there and you also want to go and post it to a bunch of YouTube videos you can see right here for this example that we did right here you can see we went out there and we posted to a bunch of YouTube videos back right here I think this is an old account right here but if you go back right about here there we go what you're going to see I think this is an old account right there anyways what you're going to do is you basically want to go and post your YouTube videos on here and then you want to post to it so let me walk you through the overall process that we use to go out there and get all these Rankings today so essentially what you do is you're going to go right here and you're going to go first off to your accounts and you're going to add these accounts to your Source machine account so you can see we have a bunch of accounts already loaded up in here from these various sources that's it now you also want to go out there and you also want to go and one of my favorite things to do is go and upload a ton of YouTube accounts that works really well too I like to use a combination of YouTube and Web 2.0 when I'm ranking YouTube videos so after we've gone and create these accounts in there it's really easy to do you just go in and you're just going to add the simple stuff right here and boom you're connected it takes 10 10 seconds to do you can also pay someone five bucks to do it and then you're done so the next thing you're going to do right here is you're going to go and you're basically going to go and put in a camping name you don't even have to spin anything I could just put in let's just do water damage we're gonna go water damage is awesome and we're going to go put in whatever our domain URL is the YouTube video that we're linking out to let's just say I'm going to link to this post right here we're going to put our YouTube video right there we're going to embed our YouTube embed code right here let me actually show you that's done in case you don't know how to do that you should but some people don't and it's all right so you're going to go right here you're going to grab the embed code and you're going to go you're going to post it right here and then we're just going to go and basically put a few more details in here I'm just going to put in water damage water damage and C the keyword is water damage and then what happens right here guys is we simply choose the date we want to post and then we hit submit that's actually it that that's all there is to it give me an X like that's it it yeah that's all there is to it and so that's how we went out there literally and you saw it took me about 30 seconds to do like if I want to actually go out there let me let me just do this the right way this right here will actually get you ranked you don't need to be putting out quality content you can put out garbage let's just go out there I'm going to show you exactly how long it would take me to go and get this ranking right here we did it yesterday okay this is how long it would take all right best service poly okay if you are looking for water damage in poly you should I can't type should totally [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] check this out I mean it's like OMG Fab and like they clean so so good man okay so that's exactly how you should you shouldn't submit that it probably won't come out like that but that that person's going to be very impressed with that review so what you're going to do then is we just paste in bed code like we talked about and I'm an idiot because I wasn't able to grab it over here I'm doing this all from my point of view guys you can see exactly how even a complete idiot could do this go in right here gonna grab my embed code jump over throw that in there boom and we're going to go no water no article spinning that's for that's for nerds and we're going to put the title water damage poly and preview description is the greatest decision I ever made in my life and done even messing that up multiple times and manually typing that all out it took me about 45 seconds to do that I I think I didn't time it out right there guys how many people could do that 30 times in a day give me a one if you could do that 30 times in a day with a different suburb and guys if I wanted to speed this up here's how I would do in a different suburb I'd change out Plano boom copy copy copy copy submit then I would go right here and type in Allen copy copy copy submit and that's it someone said someone said we could do it 100 times you should be able to do that 100 times I'm saying 30 times a day because I'm trying to cater to people that are kind of new to this okay that's it that's all we freaking do and I'm going to show you a bunch of other things Source machine does we automate traffic and that's how we go out there and rank a lot of YouTube videos we can go out there and post YouTube we can actually get competitive rankings with this but I'm just showing you the true potential because this is what I would do okay this is what this is like literally how I go out there like someone's like how do I make money with SE I'm like this is the easiest thing ever now basically once we do that guys we just do that that's it we do that over and over and over again how many people give me an X if you could do that someone said okay Obi-Wan thank you he's actually my favorite Star Wars character uh actually I think I'd be more of an Anakin fan from the Clone Wars like the the animated series The Clone Wars animated series is pretty good but guys how do we make money from this how do we make money from this give me a one if that's the big thing like this is a cool trick already but how do we make money from all these rankings right there all right look we go after high payout low search volume local and affiliate niches now here are my favorite ones lawyers rehab any kind of damage repair whenever a house gets messed up you can charge so much money to fix it plumbers any type of mechanic repairment anything like that surgery is amazing the only downside with surgery is you have to go out there and usually sell the phone calls directly you have to go out there and actually talk to somebody and anything where the job cost per customer is like $2,000 or more because the search FS usually aren't that high and when you go out to the little tall little small suburbs and stuff like that usually people in other seos don't go for those terms so it's so easy to rank for so let's put out a situation right here let's imagine guys our Niche right here is water restoration so we go out there and we're going to go and we're going to we're going to hook it up with let's say we're where is it right here which which side is this on there um I have to hop back over to W did I go and remove Offa let me hop over Okay so let's imagine right here our Niche is water damage we're going to hook it up with these guys right here who are going to pay us $32 per phone call now guys if I were to do this I would do rehab or drug addiction or lawsuits because guys they are paying $550 freaking dollars per lead okay Nationwide it doesn't matter what town you're in so that means if one of these people right here where's um let me go where's the term we were looking at here a second ago that means right here the person looking for drug addiction Counseling in Whiteville if they call this number right here and turn into a lead that means we get $550 no matter where they are give me an estimation Mark that's kind of exciting like isn't that like kind of like well I don't I don't almost believe that that's almost two damn easy yeah I thought you too I had a friend who went out there and made like a giant drug rehab site and got to like a thousand visitors a day and was making like 30,000 a month from the website within three weeks of ranking it so like I was like the rehab Niche is hilarious um so anyways let's get back to the webinar before I I get too too excited so let's imagine guys we go out there and where nich's uh is water restoration so I go out there and I rank one video okay one video just like we have done right here what's the result if we do that not too much Guys these are really ply small keywords that that video right there might get us two phone calls over the entire year which is actually pretty cool because it only took us 30 seconds to rank that video but the result we're going to get there when expressu means is skeptical cat okay that's not too impressive but let's imagine guys we sit down for 20 minutes can everybody here agree that we could go out there and we could probably do this about 30 times and probably following the pattern I just showed you get about 20 rankings Maybe 10 of them would fall off give me one if we could do that from 30 minutes of work totally reasonable okay so let's imagine we do that we sit down for 20 to 30 minutes and we go out there when we rank 20 videos for different water restoration terms give me next if we can all agree that 20 ranked terms on the first page would result in about two phone calls a month totally reasonable okay so what happens right here guys is those two phone calls $32 per call just right right I just showed you right here on our rev Vault not those ones $1,000 for doing that would be pretty cool but $32 a call awesome right there boom all right we just added $60 a month to our income now let's imagine guys for the next 20 days we did that every single day we ranked 20 rankings now guys you should be able to actually do like 200 rankings in a day don't don't judge me all right don't don't get your panties in a bundle with Source machine you can easily do hundreds of rankings a day anyways what goes on right here let's imagine we do that for 20 days straight we have 400 rankings by what we agreed on before guys give me one if it's completely reasonable those 400 rankings with the same exact conversion rates as the other ones will get us about 40 phone calls awesome we just grew our income but to $1,200 a month passively that's 12,000 that's over $112,000 a year by working 20 to 30 minutes a day now the result of that guys is a little bit nicer we got Mr Bean very nice okay that that we we're going up in the the meme world right here now let's imagine we just do this for 90 days straight 90 days straight we get 1,800 rankings that gets us a guys by our same metrics give me an next if from those 1,00 rankings we could expect about 180 phone calls a month totally reasonable not doing any not using any big numbers or anything that's that's ridiculous right there guys that would get us about 180 phone calls a month 180 phone calls times 30 equals $5,400 a month that's $60,000 a year passively by working 20 to 30 minutes a day is it give me give me an ex if that just blew your mind it's that simple we're not even we're not even having to talk to anybody we just send the phone calls to those people now here's the big kicker guys we can easily put up a 100 rankings a day and and this will take about a week or two to get to this point I'm not saying two weeks after this webinar you're going to be making 60k a year you might need to exper I don't I don't know what would stop you I really can't I can't imagine I'm not allowed to leave say man you're going to be making 60k a year right after this webinar but I don't know what can stop you because literally today I just showed you we logged in we can just log in strain The Source machine right here I just showed you we actually just went out there and did that like you can see right here the same exact rankings we just went through like literally here they all are drug addiction counselor or here's the one for drug addiction right here boom right there like I don't see what's stopping you because this took about this took Chris about 30 minutes to do so I don't know what's stopping you from doing this but we could go out there give me an ex give me a y if you would go out there and get 100 rankings away 100 rankings a day yeah everybody in this freaking webinar so guys here's the bigger kicker let me get a drink of my blueberry banana smoothie water damage is an example of a lower end Niche let's imagine we get in the rhinoplasty okay and you can sell this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for $100 a call no problem no problem why because a rhino surge rhal plastic surgery or surgeon makes about $5,000 from every single person that he does surgery on so give me a why if it's completely reasonable that they pay $100 per phone call they actually pay a lot more but I just want to be reasonable with everyone right here okay so guys if we go out there and we do the 20-day process and get 20 rankings a day 400 rankings 40 phone calls a month that's $44,000 a month passively in our first month now here's the funny kicker and this is what I would do you're not going to believe me because the numbers are too big but I don't see why you can't so look let's look at this Niche right here rehab let's imagine you go out there and they're paying $400 per phone call I'm not telling you this I'm not pulling this number out my butt they are literally paying you don't even have to like go out there and do anything they're paying like 400 bucks a phone call right here $400 per lead $400 per lead CU they make like so much money off every single person that comes in so it's totally worth it and it's really competitive Niche actually if you're selling that because people have to choose where they're going to go to anyways right here let's imagine we go out there and we get 20 rankings a day we get 400 rankings now guys I'm going to say I'm just going to lower the conversions just to lower the numbers a little bit let's say we only get 20 phone calls a month from those 400 rankings those 20 phone calls turn into 20 leads that is $88,000 a month passively from 20 phone calls I know it's seems [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy but the numbers all add up we've all looked at the numbers and we agree on this give me a one if that's just absolutely huge I know so many people they're in niches like this and this is how they make so much money from SEO this is how the richest seos I know actually make money they're not going out there ranking for these like car insurance and stuff they're going out there and finding niches like this and just sending tons of lawyers and tons of phone calls like that guys give me a why if you are not entertained like holy moly guacamole so guys this is all from Simply posting every day in Source machine that is it that's it and guys here's some bonus tactics we're going to get a few bonus tactics you can sell this on how many people here would pay 20 bucks to have someone do this on conquer for them give me one if that's you I don't know if you're a conquer seller or not but if you looked at this right now there's about 500 ones going off for now bonus tactic number one go out there and sell these types of rankings this type of SEO all these posting on conquer it's very in demand it's absolutely huge okay now back to the webinar number two you're talking to a client on the phone he goes you know I I I've been working with seos before but I I I haven't had a good experience give me an X if you've ever heard that people that had bad experience with former seos that they worked with yep well guess what how cool would it be if you said all right cool what I'm going to do is I'm going to rank you for term uh and I'm going to call you back in an hour and you call them back I'm say oh boom you're you're ranked or even cooler guys if you can go out there and say you know what you just came on as a client I'm Gonna Get You 10 rankings actually I'm Gonna Get You 20 rankings all over the state of Texas today so we can start getting you phone calls right now yeah that's a weapon right there give me a one if you think you could probably get a client to come around if you could do that type of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in front of him bonus tactic number two guys I'm going to show you exactly one of the key tactics between let me load up my channel real quick one of the key tactics behind how I grew my channel to over 5 million views and 94,000 subscribers last year so you're going to see on my channel I have these really quirky videos that go up there so I make a clickbait title okay I then go out there and I'll load up Source machine and I will go out there and I will post to about 200 Web 2.0 I'll embedded all over the place so then what I'm going to do guys is once the video gets a little bit of traction on YouTube what I'm going to do is I'm going to go on over to Source machine I have to go back over here now and what I do after posting it I'm going to go over here to traffic now what YouTube really looks at is interaction and time spent watching the videos and traffic clicking on the videos they look at clickthrough rates and so what I'm going to do right here is I'm going to go add this campaign this is like the highend stuff right here basically I'm just going to put this in click on the YouTube video and I'm just going to fill this out with just I'm just going to put in random stuff right here because we're running out of time on the webinar let me just load up a YouTube video real quick and we're GNA use uh does being a millionaire help you get laid okay uh so there we go so we're going to put this video on here and we're going put in campaign name example put in the URL there you go and we're going to do via search engine I'm going to do um Alex Becker just as the keyword and I'm going to select search in I'm going to YouTube and I'm just hit next step and what I can do here is I can set it to be about I can set it to about I don't know 50 people a day searching for it and I can have them go on there and spend a certain amount of time looking at the video and I can go on here and I can do geolocation tracking and have them coming through certain locations and so I put this order in and then once I set it off right there guys those people are going to go search for my keyword through that term every single day and increase the click through rate increase the watch time increase the people going out there and liking and watching my video and that is huge when it comes to ranking YouTube videos that's a really Advanced Tech and that's like one of the coolest things machine does but I just want to get into that give me a three if that's pretty damn cool yeah so really my question right here is is how many people here give me an X if you'd like a copy of source machine so you can just do all the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you just saw in this webinar all right that's a lot of x's guys what you can do today is get complete access to Source machine and what you're going to get inside Source machines you're going to get the full link building uh Suite that I just showed you the authority link building suite you're going to get the embeddable link building video system where you can go and embed videos all over the place you're going to get the YouTube link building that is inside there you're going to get the traffic automation is inside that shows YouTube and Google that traffic is going to your website and you're going to go out there and you're also going to be able to get the click-through rate manipulation that Source machine does we didn't even have time to really tap on those things because I was talking about my favorite strategy with this now how many people here give me one if you think this is pretty cool but you don't think you know enough about SEO you don't think you know quite enough yet to get the most out of this software it's fine guys because what we're going to give you when you get inside is three things we're going to give you a complete SEO beginners course we're also going to take you through basic posting how many people here give me a three if you would [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your pants and you actually sat behind and watch Chris over his shoulder post and do these rankings be in front of you and we actually gave you a list of all the the niches and everything you know out the go when you get inside source machine not only do we give you a beginner's course we also have Chris sit down and show him posting the niches he's picking and do it over the should and you literally rank videos in 30 minutes in front of you we also show you how to

you need now on top of that guys we're also going to give you Advanced client getting webinars and these are going to be five webinars where I sit down and I break down exactly how I got clients in the past I'm going to show you myself actually closing clients live on a webinar this is going to be five the webinars are about an hour and so you're going to see exactly how to get clients as well so you don't have to rely on those CPA offers either you can actually sell this directly to dentists flower shops rhinoplasty surgeons it doesn't matter I always deal in the medical Niche because that's what I always dealt in because it's the easiest niche in the world but whatever you want to sell to you can sell to now on top of that guys we're also going to give you a blueprint of all the keywords you should be targeting so you don't even have to worry about this we're just going to give you a list of the keywords and you just go out there and start targeting these suburbs and there's so many creative ways you can apply this but if you're just starting off we're going to give you everything you need to do to go through the tactic we just talked about step by step by step so what you're going to be getting guys is you're going to get Source machine you're going to get the SEO ranking course you're gonna get the five client getting webinar uh system we're going to show you that and we're going to walk you through all that we're going to give you all the keywords to go after and guys that's easily a $2,000 value here's my question for you guys if in the next 30 days you are ranking for 400 different terms would that be worth $2,000 give me a one if that's true if you were if you were generating an extra $1,500 a month for the rest of this year yeah it would if that's all it did if all this if all this software did take away everything else if all it did was exactly what I showed you it did in this webinar if all it did was the stuff that we just showed you how to Simply do in this webinar in about 30 minutes would it be worth it yeah so guys what I'm going to give you today is we're going to give you up to $500 or up to $2,000 off of source machine give me an X if that sounds pretty to cool we have a special deal lineup and we're also throwing in all those bonuses as well so if you guys want to get in this all you need to do right now we've set the prices

automate tons of traffic to your clients and actually get into the advanced rankings you want to get the proy package okay so that's the package you want to get right here guys 10K post per month is how much you can go out there and post to your places if you're selling this for example if you're wanting to sell this on conquer you want the proy level because you're going to be posting so many times you're going to be posting thousands and thousands of times a day if you're going right here if you're actually just going to be doing this for your clients you want the engineer because you'll probably posting maybe 500 times a day on there if you're just starting out you want to go and use this tactic that I just showed you right here you want to jump on the base level and just go do that

50% the bonuses all go off the table and the bonuses for the engineer and proy package go off the table as well so I'm going to field some questions right now before we get in someone said I'm an SEO beginner can I do that I I'm not GNA answer that question by saying yes or no I'm gonna ask you if you can do this can you you tell me if you can do this or not okay I don't know you I don't know what you're G to do let me go load this let me hop in can you do this step one we're going to go add an account can you go in and create an account on bitly and then go out and fill out your account email and then put in your access token everybody here give me a one if you can do that if you can create a bitly count and put in your access token give me a one if you can do that okay can you then go to post and fill out a quick form following the basic training we have right here we have basic tutorials that show you the basic things to put in here the basic things to post the basic way to use every part of it if you can follow basic directions what you're going to learn is all you need to do is come in here and type in the keyword keyword you put in the video embed you put in the domain and then you hit submit that is literally all we did today to go out there and rank these exact videos that we're showing you in here I showed you the motorcycle repair one right there here's the post we put today that's exactly what we did that's it so don't ask me if I'm a beginner can I do this or not I don't know but can you do that as any person on planet Earth I think so somebody said how many videos can be posted per Channel as many as you want there's no limit on [Music] YouTube again guys as soon as we're going to be closing this down in five minutes I'm going to set a little timer right here um I'm going to go right here over to Google and put in a countdown come on man get it type today and I'm going to set this for five minutes right here you can see we're at five minutes on there I'm going to hop off um someone said how do you make sure the keywords you're picking are right guys we have training inside that show you the keywords to pick we also give you a list of keywords to go after and a list of ways to use them so you don't even have to pick the keywords or do any research just use the keywords we give you uh someone said will it take 30 minutes per ranking with Source machine here's what's going to happen if you don't use Source machine and every webinar guys give me an X if you understand that I always show you free methods to do what I'm talking about and I show you a faster way to do that I'm never up here trying to sh say the only way you can do this is for you buy this if you don't use Source machine it's going to take you a lot longer and posting getting 100 rankings a day is going to be pretty much uh that's unreasonable also your rankings are not going to be as high because you're not posting yet on 50 or so web 2.0's the more web 2.0's you have the higher you're going to rank for these terms and the easier you're going to rank the end so if you use the free method your results are not going to be as good and they're going to be very very slow that being said if you want to get serious about this there's no risk to do this guys when you hop in look even if you're a beginner and you're afraid guys if you hop in and this isn't for you just get a refund 30 days from now there's zero risk and guys you're not going to see go to any of my groups we have over 10 we have almost 20,000 members in our groups we're giving the refunds guys we don't mind giving refunds on stuff okay that's fine so someone said you're super dude we we give refunds there's no re like if you put the $99 in for the base package give it a try follow the basic training in there that's it man if it's not for you just refund in 30 days and guys we're also all the training we're throwing in right here you also get to keep so even if you come in we're going to
