[Music] okay guys this is Becker again welcome to the fourth video the end of this video the T-shirt button will unlock you able to enter your address and we'll be transplanting that funnel into your account but let's talk about how to send emails to all those people that are opting in now and all the people that you imported earlier on so before we send an email what you're going to want to do is you're want to go to settings and you want to fill out this information right here you want to give your business address when signing up if you don't want to use your actual address that's fine and you also want to put in your send name your default reply to email all this information right here so that market Hero has your information when you send it out it won't actually let you send an email until you put the stuff in because it's illegal to go out there and send emails without a return address so now that you've done that what you want to do is we want to go over here to broadcast you want to go to add new broadcast now very simple I'm just going to go put in my address I'm going to be sending from and when you get inside there's actually going to be a guide called the SPF guide it's going to be above this right here it's going to be the first thing you also see when you come in it's a quick little thing you can add to your websites to make sure your emails get almost double the deliverability that they probably do at other places you're probably using a random email or like a support email that you don't have connected to your site because of that your deliverability is probably hurting a lot from that so be sure to watch that now I'm going to put in my from name right here and this is where stuff starts to get fun so I'm going to go right here and I'm going to put in who's going to receive this email let's so let's say I want everybody who has the Alex Becker tag on them anybody who's joined my Alex Becker brand list I I want to send an email to them okay but let's imagine I'm sending this out to them and I'm trying to romote a product I just sent them so I don't want to send the same email that people have already bought something so what I can do right here is I can go down to Advanced setting and I want to have add a negative tag or a negative segment to this and so I go right here and I can put in the dollar sign and I can go and pick offers someone might have bought or I can pick another tag any combination of anything so I have this right here and you're going to see this is going to subtract 11 people from that total segment right there so what we have now is a segment of people who have not bought a certain product but are on a certain list pretty cool right we can easily go and do all sorts of stuff with this and all sorts of other combinations that we'll get into and then more advanced tutorials inside the system now what we can do right here is we can go and send an email we can use a template by just clicking here and loading up templates we've used in the past you can see really simple uh template that I have used in the past there or we can just go create a new email now the way the email Builder works really simple we just go here we can add text we can add an image if we want and um that's it we can go out here you can start writing your email out we can format it we can go and change uh the styles of the font you know really easy to use we can change the width of the email you can change the color uh everything in here is customizable to whatever extent you want we can go change you know the image Dimensions right here we can do anything we want inside of this uh it's extremely flexible extremely simple and really good at sending really simple plain sexy emails to just look great you can also go out there add images add your own HTML and stuff like that that makes it you know look super unique but one emailing tip right here the more plain your email is the less HTML you have going on the better chance you have delivering and getting in the inbox especially that Gmail promotions tag if you have a lot of images it's going to be really hard to inbox in the promotions tag like that so I'm just going to hit save right here and let's just imagine I'm going to send this ugly email out don't do this to your list you goof and then I go over here and hit send now and boom it goes out now let's say I want to see the stats for this email we're going to click back the broadcast so what we can now do is we can go back through our emails that we' sent out and we can click see stats we can actually see everyone who's opened it we can create a segment based on that which I'll show you in a second we can see how much money that email generated based on the tracking codes we talked about even down right to to the earning per email that we sent out now say we want to mail to everybody that didn't open it we can go right here click on opened and boom it will show us a list of everybody didn't open and we can just go up here and send it to them so that's the broadcast system in a nutshell that's all there is to it you can do a lot of advanced things with it or you can keep it really simple and that's the Pinnacle of what we want to do at Mark hero allow you to do super Advanced Marketing in a very simple easy to understand way so this has been Becker I'll see you on the next page
