================================================================================

well hello there you sleazy internet marketer would you like an ad template that is so manipulative and evil that you can get anybody to buy virtually any form of dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you sell on the internet without any effort whatsoever of course you do you don't care how the money comes in just as long as it does so I too am a shameful piece of sh and what I'm going to show you in this video is an ad that I'm frankly embarrassed of I I I'm ashamed that I put this on the internet but I'm not ashamed of the amount of money it generated this stupid terrible iPhone shot ad generated millions of dollars generated crazy leads and sales and was core to a business that generated tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars from me just running it from my garage and this ad was so damn convincing and the blueprint for this ad so effective that was able to Spur an entire huge multi-million dollar business and the craziest thing about this is this blueprint for this ad I have used for almost a decade now because nothing beats it you can whip out an iPhone you can shoot this on a Geral I don't know how you do that but you could shoot it on a Geral doesn't matter the quality of the video you can have skitchy ass audio it beats everything out there every high quality ad anything you could imagine and I've been using this template for forever and the reason why you should pay attention to this is a I know what the I'm talking about I've used ads on the internet which this channel is about to build 28 figureure businesses and build a nine figureure business I'm also the CEO of one of the largest ad tracking companies in the entire world hyros so I know it's working across ads across billions and billions of dollars of AD spend and I'm also extremely good-looking and have a six-pack and have a lot of followers that means I'm right about everything so you should definitely listen to me and then coolest of all I don't even have aing course to sell you cuz I'm already extremely rich I'm just going to tell you everything I know on this channel and hope that eventually decide you want to track your ads on hyros because it will make you more money so that's why you should listen but the big crazy reason you should listen here is because this ad is selling the hardest thing to sell on the internet which is info now I know you might roll your eyes and think oh info marketing I'm sure you've seen the people slinging courses and telling you they're going to get rich online but in truth you should really pay attention to those because that's the hardest form of marketing to sell ever you're basically selling thin air you're basically saying hey I got a really good secret it's really good if you if you pay me a lot of money I'll tell you my secret that's a really hard pitch selling skin cream that heals acne selling hyros to software that improves people's ad results that's not hard I can prove that works all day but convincing someone that you have a secret that's so damn fing good that they give you thousands of dollars that is the cream the creme that is the hardest form of marketing there is and you take the templates and the strategies that are used in that marketing to make your marketing for your actual easy to sell products B tilion times better so what I want to do now is I want to break down this ad to you because um it works and then I'm going to curl away and shame that I ever that I ever operated or made ads this terrible on the internet but they work they work I'm I hate that they do but here you go let's let's get into this okay guys so this you might have seen this ad in the past because this has been studied by Scholars and institutions alike actually this is this is semi one of my most famous ads so this is a wolf Muk ad and we were selling a product called hcom back in the day which taught people how to build e-commerce stores the product itself isn't too important what we would do is I got and partnered up with two guys who were making like I don't know $10 million a year on e-commerce and we basically made a course on how to make e-commerce stores this is back when e-commerce was really hot it was easy business for people to get into and build I don't really know if it's too easy for beginners to into today but this worked very well in the past allowing us to create a product that had tons of results and allowed us to use a lot of marketing techniques you see I use today at hyros that said that none of that matters none that just just throw that out out the window all that matters is this damn ad and the persuasion techniques and the flow of this ad and how it works because this got people to come on opt in for leads for a webinar sit through a two-hour webinar and then get sold a product that I believe that its peak was about $5,000 now I'm aware courses and everything are kind of a gray area in the internet and frankly I don't I don't care but that's not the point of that the thing you need to be focusing on is that it was able to sell such a hard-to sell product which is literally just thin air getting people to come and sign up and pay thousands of dollars for a course uh just based on talking just talking it's incredible just a collection of information and so I want to show you the first step in this and how I made these ads so profitable now these work on Facebook this works especially well on YouTube ads let's get into it in the next 45 seconds I'm going to show you how we took a brand new e-commerce Shopify store from zero to okay so let's focus on the first 5 Seconds of this ad the first thing I'm trying to do here is do a lot of weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now why do I do a lot of weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to start of these ads specifically ads where you have to go really hard um you really have to grab the person's attention everybody's seen a thousand make money online ads how do I get a person's attention here so first off 45 seconds big title this is everything they're going to get in this but then what I start throwing down here is this Game of Thrones mug at the time Game of Thrones was really popular narrated by Alex Becker karaoke world champion there's too much weird stuff going on here to not catch the person's attention this weird mug generated us this huge result so what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to get some result that they're obviously interested in promise it will be done very quickly and create this story or hook that they want to hear people want to see how this crazy little mug right here is generating $200 a day that's the big hook and so what you can do with your main product is let's imagine you were selling a skin cream or something like that I'm always going to just used to sking cream on these Channels cuz I like goo if you watch every video I'm like this is how you sell pus to skin cream if I just ever could open a skin cream company I'd be a billionaire but that's not for me that's for you that's why you're watching this channel so if I had a skin cream company what I would do is I wouldn't put like my product down here in a nice presentable way I'd put like a freaking fruit that's in the product or some one of the weirdest ingredients like I do like this weird amphibious frog cured my acne and I'm going to tell you how I did it in in 45 seconds you want to find some way to attach an interesting object story unique something to the result that they want because that's going to get it if I show you how this skin cream fix my acne in 45 days no one's going to listen to it if I say give me 45 seconds I'm going to show you how this Turtles butt skin made my skin glisten like pamel Anderson's tits I don't know it made my skin look fantastic all right that that's that's what we want to do right there and that's going to hook people and this is very very very important you if you ever watch me breaking down my hyros ads which are also on this channel for free below this video again you're going to see me use a very similar tactic In Those ads by like flashing a little Iron Man thing uh in front of it or again creating this this story so this first 5 seconds is incredibly important with any AD you run took a brand new e-commerce Shopify store from0 to $200 per day in less than 5 days selling only this wolf mug now look I know this wolf mug is pretty dang impressive but the real key here is how my buddy is doing about $400,000 per month from his shop by store okay so one thing I would actually add to this ad at this point is I would have backed it up immediately with testimonials now this was back in my infancy in internet marketing this is almost six years ago okay um this is back when YouTube ads were also very kind of newish as well as you know I'm quite the Pioneer but um what I would have done immediately after that is I would have backed it up with testimonals which we do in other ads um if you ever notice whenever I use that type of pitch or opening in my my H it's immediately backed up with uh testimonies from famous people so that's one thing I would have thrown under right there but what I'm doing now is I'm telling the story of how this person got results now I start talking about Matt Smith the guy who was the the the course creator in this situation right here but what you want to do is if I was in this situation I didn't have testimonials or even if I did have testimonials I'd break immediately into a story about a certain person or the focus of the ad that relates to the customer so in this situation I talk about M because it was was like skincare I'm going to show you how this 15-year-old girl and this 40 40-year-old man named Bob and this 25-year-old office lady all fix their acne using this frog so look it was actually invented by this guy Frederick who was going around the Amazon and would actually start rubbing this on his face to heel Burns but after 30 days what he started noticing is that all of his skin and wrinkles started going away you see how I create this kind of like weird story right there the back of of up so here's this thing weird thing here's a bunch of testimonal and stuff that proves it works here's the story behind that gets you in interested in what's going on here so you can see I start telling the story to hook people in and get people into uh the the Curiosity phase where they want to click the story isn't here to pitch the product or make the person want to buy it's to get it's to create these feedback loops the person has to figure out has to click on to dive into if the person doesn't complete this story in their head they're not going to be satisfied on top of that the story itself gives Credence or some justification on why this is very unique and it has to work if I just told people it's this skin cream they use it for 30 days they're not going to be interested if I told him it's this breakthrough that happened because some guy in Amazon was rolling through mud and rubbing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on his face they're much more interested at this point in time in the story and the loop and they think that there's something unique that they haven't seen before here so this is important wolf mug is pretty dang impressive but the real key here is how my buddy is doing about $400,000 per month from his shop by stores picks these product and then it's very very specific targeting on Facebook and the proof his system works we literally went and picked up this wolf mug and build so this is the other part of this ad that I think is extremely effective in certain niches so what we do in this example right here as I say my buddy he's making 400,000 a month from his Shopify stores and what we did to prove that this worked is we went and grabbed this stupid mug and we turn it into a $200 a day store if you click this ad we will break down and show you how we did this step by step this is why this ad was so damn effective is because what we did is you we're not linking a person to a product right here we're linking a person to a challenge which is essentially a sales pitch for the product what we do is we say hey my buddy's making this much money this shop by process we're using is obviously working the skin cream we're using is obviously working this this uh sewing tool we're using is actually working this blah blah whatever the you're selling is obviously working it's working so damn well look at these crazy results but people don't Rel light to Crazy results it's not like hey look at this supermodel has Perfect Skin she uses our skin cream what you do once you have these incredible results is you tie it down to a challenge to prove it what people like is proof but what they really like to see is challenges you ever seen like Mr Beast um when he ever does anything he does it's like a challenge like how many foone books can this gun shoot through all right people want to see this this type of event or challenge be completed in front of them that then will in turn back up your product so what we do here is we say my buddy's doing so well but again don't focus on what my buddy's doing we're going to prove this works by just grabbing this stupid ass thing and making a $200 a day thing and then leaving the entire blueprint down for you so you can come and actually watch us do this if you're skeptical all that's fine we get it we're going to do it right in front of you with this damn mug and because we're so damn cocky and arrogant this works we can prove it so easily we can take any piece of garbage on the internet and turn into a profitable product that's the message right there so if we were doing in skin cream we could go and tell a little story about the Amazon or my buddy or whatever um I have this let's let's make another story about that I know I'm kind of spitballing here I'm just trying to give you a brain dump of everything I know so if it comes in Inc incoherent waves at you well that's just your problem not not mine um so what I'm trying to do here if I was doing skin care say we have a a Doctor Who's healed over 400,000 other people's skins they look amazing now and look that's a far touch that's a big tale you're probably skeptical so what we actually did is we filmed live 23 people people over two weeks and we started applying this weird frog ointment to their face okay and every single one you show before and after pictures of the people was able to see better lines and wrinkles right here and what we're going to actually do is if you click this ad what we're going to do is we're going to show you a video of stepbystep how they applied this cream and how they did it and you can actually find this cream very very easily and we'll give you the resources and everything for that too that's going to hook the people to the ad they come see a sales video they store from scratch and got it to $200 per day in less than 5 days and what we're so another thing right here obviously people want results fast we got this this shop by store to $200 a day in 5 days that was the whole story if you can find some way to tie results fast into what you're doing people are going to be even more interested today is we're having a special web class where we're going to be breaking down this entire process and if you're interested in attending this 100% free web class all you need to do is click in the top right hand corner if you're on mobile and click in the bottom leftand corner if you're on desktop it's going to take you to a page that looks just like this ENT your email this is pretty much the conclusion of the ad this 45 seconds is all that really matters we can go into all the stuff that's happening after this but it's really just me repeating what the class is okay so the 45 seconds right here this is when we like I said I actually did what I was going to do on my ads there's been ads where I'm like give me 45 seconds and then I spend like 5 minutes explaining nonsense so this is one of the ads where I actually am honest and and do what I say I'm going to do because I'm a turd but you can see right here we got this everything in and message to the person within 45 seconds now with this funnel right here one thing I'm just going to add when when you're running ads like this you should be using hyos to track them look I'm not going to pitch you any info prod this channel because I just want to give you straight up information that's going to get you results with ads the end if you get results with ads you need to be tracking them I have the best tracking company on the internet if you go and look at the leads that hos was able to track compared to the calls and leads that came in from Facebook same thing with Google Adwords iris is catching and summonses three times more leads and calls coming in you cannot run these type of funnels where you're trying to get sales calls or people to attend webinars or long sales pitches and not be using the right data if I was using Facebook data right here I'd be turning off half of these ads and this would completely kill my ability to scale and make more money from the ads you should be tracking your ads as soon as you start making any kind of money from them on top of that what was very important was me actually seeing what sales were coming through if you're using Facebook or Google to actually track the sales coming from long form sales pitches if you're doing something like this you're not able to attach the re Revenue back consistently thus you're not able to see which audiences are draining you the actual right customers that are buying long-term subscriptions long-term Revenue long-term closes you're not going to see that thus you should again be using hyros for this if you pick up hyros and it doesn't help your ad skill you don't even have to pay for it we have you an ad scale guarantee that's why Alex rosi Tony Robbins Playboy Pier One bodybuilding.com hell even Dan bazan just recently signed up for hos everybody uses it you should use it too it'll make you way more money if it doesn't you don't pay for it so that's the hrus Shi for the day which I'm going to shamelessly tell you because it will just straight up make you more money I would be a jerk if if I was telling you to run ads without tracking that being said you can see what's going on at the end of this ad right here I I went and told that story or that hook for the event and then go and show them the page they're about to land on this is very important because you don't want the person to get to the sales page and just be shocked by what they see you want to show people the page they're going to land on and exactly what they need to do on that page so if you're interested in seeing this thing you can come to this web class it's going to show you this page you're going to go to a page that looks just like this and you click register now and opt in this is going to drop your cost per lead so much very simple process and if you watch any AD I've ever made it's very similar to this so let's recap first 5 Seconds the thing that they're interested in which is making money quickly all right the thing they're also interested in not wasting a lot of time attached in a weird presentation or wrapper okay so we're giving them what they want but we're making it an interesting story so how I cleared up all my acne with this weird wart that we got off the back of a frog okay and so we then do is we create a unique story or some type of authority now what we should do immediately a after actually is show testimonials and proof then we should go into the story but I was an idiot and didn't put this in this ad still works super well what we then do is we create some type of Authority or story that shows extreme results so for example we have this doct tberry and he's cured over 400,000 people's acne using frog warts isn't that weird crazy story and and this ad I'm going to tell you how he did it so what we've done at that point in time is we've created this really unique story that they want to hear the rest of but they're skeptical at this point and so what we're then going to do is do this but instead of telling you how this story Works we're just going to prove it to you we've gotten 23 people and we shot them live every single day and showed the results they gotten from these frog wart thing this frog wart secret ingredient that nobody's using so what we do is we create this event or this challenge that they want to see completed well I'm going to you these shoes will make you run 5 Seconds faster in a 40 m 400 meter dash or something like that and to prove it we had 50 athletes come and put the shoes on and then run with other shoes here are the results you can come see us doing it right here something like that and this example right here I said look my friend's making 400,000 a month because his Shopify process is so amazing but to prove it to you we're literally going to build a store right in front of you and get it to $200 a day live right in front of you and all you have to do is click this ad to see us do this live okay so we create some type of event or challenge to get the person to click the ad because the ultimate thing we're trying to do here is get them to watch a sales video and if you run sales video style ads which are extremely effective for calls webinars um selling any type of any type of e-commerce product ever I think selling sending people to a a sales video is 10 times more effective than just linking them straight to a page especially for products like acting or something like that we didn't do that then we're going to do is we link them or we tell them what to do and what to do next and we show them where they're going to go and then we instruct them what they're going to do on the page okay so that simple little process right there made just a ton of money it's a very simple ad you can see how simply it's shot it's just shot in my living room with a with a phone and a little audio voice over and that made me tens of millions of dollars and so you should apply this logic whether you're selling really good traditional products or you're selling complete nonsense on the internet which I know a lot of you are you can apply this to it and it just straight up works because it's a core persuading someone and hooking them and getting them to do what you want so if you like videos like this I have other videos where I review my hyros ads and more kind of traditional ads right below this video I have my full YouTube ad scripts broken down in a script template right below this video I have literally the funnels that I was using right here and the funnels I use right below this video on this channel everything I do is just on this channel for free and hopes that you make more money from your ads and eventually decide not to be a drunken baboon and actually track your ads with hos so that being said this is the video I hope you enjoyed and um you know good luck and selling whatever you're selling okay bye
