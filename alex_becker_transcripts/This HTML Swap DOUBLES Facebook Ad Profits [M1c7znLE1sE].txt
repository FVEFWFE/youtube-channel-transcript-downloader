================================================================================

in this video i'm going to show you three simple things that will reduce your ad cost on facebook even youtube ads actually any ads where you're running something and you need people to convert higher these three little micro adjustments will make your opt-ins your conversion rate your sales rate much higher without you actually changing anything on your funnel because what i've seen constantly from working with clients at hi-ros and looking at all the information coming in there and just my own funnels is that there's usually these small hang-ups that people just don't know about in their funnels like for example the type of html that's page or how you're loading up your scripts or just simply how you're linking to your pages from facebook they can go and easily increase your conversion rate by another five ten in fact i'm going to show you a little switch in this that i made that makes almost virtually no difference to the funnel functionally took me absolutely no effort and improved my opt-in rate by almost 30 that increases my profit my roi my revenue by 30 as well so it's definitely worth it and that's what we're gonna get into in today's highways training it's that damn simple if you're wondering why i'm teaching all these things it's simple when your ad accounts grow you're probably going to need to track them and if i help you grow your ad accounts you're probably going to think maybe i should track them with hiros it's going to help you save so much money on your ads and help you scale much further once you get to some type of scale so i'm going to help you scale as much as i possibly can so that being said we're going to hop into my computer right now and i want to show you these three things this just saved me a whopping butt ton of money and maybe a lot more revenue so let's skip to intros and fancy talk just get these and surprise surprise i'm gonna do way more than three i was doing this list and there's so many little things that have improved my roi immensely without effort so i'm just gonna share them all with you and then i'll stop when i get bored so first one right here this one is huge this is a case study i shared inside my uh consulting mastermind we basically go over our funnels and our ads and basically everything i'm doing and everything i've done the scalia figure businesses more importantly i share all my tests and everything i'm doing there and this test was huge so i knew this was going to happen because i did this with one of my first info businesses a lot of people host all their opt-ins on landing page softwares you might be using click funnels or other landing page softwares now convert tree out here is actually pretty good but most landing page softwares they're very slow and you wouldn't notice this because when you check your landing pages you're probably checking from your computer or your phone and you're using a place has a good connection but you have to understand most people browsing around facebook and watching youtube ads they're you a lot of the time not at their home they're not in a stable internet connection so they're going to be working with pretty small or slow download speeds and so these can take ages to download seven seconds 10 seconds this page for example right here when we converted it from click funnels to pure html the opt-in rate jumped from 18 uh to 32 you can see that in this test right here this one the first test that came in and after about 250 visitors the final results were what was on click funnels was 18 and what was on html was i believe 31 percent that's massive that's 30 percent more customers opting in that means if i have a funnel that's sharing 100k a month from that 18 opt-in rate i go and increase that that thing is going to generate an extra thirty thousand forty thousand a month just for making that change that's all i did that's all i did drastically improved opt-in rates now do i suggest you take all your funnels off of click funnels or landing page software no what i see when people go to the next page is they're a little bit more lenient with the load time so there's a lot of advantages to be on a landing page software so just letting you know that but you want your first landing pages to be in total hyper fast html you can upload this directly to your site no wordpress no anything and that's going to give you the maximum oomph and this is the most important page of your funnel because how people interact with it determines the whole entire rest of the interaction okay so if you can get past my ugly face right here i'm about to share two other huge things this this applies to youtube supplies of facebook first off biggest one at the end of your videos let the person know when it's done i can't stress this enough when you're doing this on youtube especially what happens is a lot of people end their ad and it just ends so the person a lot of people are going to watch the ad and it just boom ends on them and then they're watching their video and then they're watching cats and you've lost them so what you want to do is at the end of your videos just have a simple message saying hey it's time to click the ad click to get the script and the free training on how to use it that's it that's it's the most immensely important thing you can do and you should also do this on facebook as well if you don't do this people watch the ad then it stops then they don't know what to do next they do know what to do next but they have to be prodded okay next thing i'd really suggest is that the top of your ads in in facebook and youtube ads have a extremely curiosity peaking headline you don't want to tell them what the person is going to see in the video what you want to do is you want to create curiosity to get them to click the video and turn on sound on facebook or to get them to watch that five seconds on youtube this right here and what you say right here is incredibly important on youtube because those first five seconds you don't want to tell them what they're going to see because then they know what they're going to see and they're going to click away you want to say something that's extremely interesting to your target market for example if i said something like you know watch this cat eat a pizza in 10 seconds it's going to get the entire internet watching it that's not good that's going to drive up my view rate on my ads and drive up the cost i want to have something that says something like the biggest edge in digital ads right now and it only means something to for example you if you're watching this video you're interested in ads i'm going to track you on that video and repulse everybody else that's how you keep the ad costs a lot lower especially on youtube again just because a video has really high interaction and views doesn't mean it's getting the right people in fact on youtube we'll make your costs a lot higher if you're attracting everybody because then they're going to show up to everybody and we don't want everyone who wants to watch a cat eat a pizza want everybody who wants to create digital ads or whatever your target market is okay so the next one guys this is again so simple because you just have to do it you don't have to add anything to it track your ads you can see right here the funny thing that's going on is you can see that if i'm going off of what google is telling me this example right here one i'm using call funnel so google's not going to track my sales i constantly see people optimizing their ads for opt-ins and calls specifically if you're doing this it's going to get you calls but that doesn't mean all calls are created equal it also doesn't mean all opt-ins are created equal the only thing you want to be optimizing in your funnels for is sales okay and so this is using the high-risk extension right here i don't know how else you can do this i'm not trying to push hiros onto you right now but the only way i could actually track my sales and optimize around actual numbers is by doing this and more importantly just be hyper aware of this the facebook pixel is not going to go and consistently deliver accurate results you can see right here if i go and look at let's say these audiences right here and i go look at these results of the calls coming in i guarantee this audience right here that says eight calls right here you can see it only generate three calls now i'm perfectly happy with this 400 per column my niche is absolutely excellent for me but a lot of times what you're going to see with view through conversions and how facebook loads up its pixels it's going to report more calls than it's actually bringing in and on top of that it's not going to be again reporting off of actual sales coming in as well and so my biggest advice for you too is don't take what's being reported to you at face value in there first off always optimize around money because if you do that you're going to get the best roi most people don't and so they have these call funnels or webinar funnels or even e-commerce funnels where they're going off all these metrics are relevant to the cash that's coming in and if you incentivize google and facebook to deliver calls and opt-ins it's going to deliver those as much as it possibly can ignore the roi because it's not being targeted towards roi and then finally the next thing is understand that view through conversions and double firing of pixels and everything that goes on that's a thing it's a it's a big real thing i can go in and verify every single one of these calls and where they came from i can go inside of hiros and i can see every single call that came in and attribute where it came from you can see i have not missed attribution on a call out of 20 calls that came in there's only one that didn't get attributed okay 2 out of 30 at this point right here i see where every single one came from there's no calls coming in my system that aren't attributed and so what a lot of people are doing is they're working off this number right here and that's just causing all sorts of chaos in their business they don't even know okay this cost per call is fine for me but i see people paying a thousand dollars per call when they think they're getting a hundred dollars per call don't do that it takes seconds to set that up and actually track your ads which i suggest using hiris or you can use whatever solution you want just just do it okay so the next one i want to show you i see this all the time on facebook you see this fold right here the seymour you need to understand that most people coming from facebook most people in general these days are on their phone so this is all people are going to see on their phone and what a lot of people do is they go and write their ads thinking that people are going to click see more i don't know about you i don't click see more on a lot of ads so while people will go and click see more and while you will see slightly better conversions when people read your entire script and it's well written it's great copy what i've found is extremely important is you need to make your message wrap up or at least be very clear before this see more link right here when you're writing out your message you can see i have about this line right here to make a point ai tracking drops add cpa by 30 to 50 it allows optimization other businesses cannot replicate and it takes two seconds to set up you want to create curiosity and you want to create the big benefit they're going to get if they click see more more importantly click see this ad next thing you want to do that i think is also super important is you want to create almost tmz like headlines you want to create something that tells a story you never want to tell people exactly what they're going to get come here and get this blueprint nobody wants a blueprint they want to hear the end of a story these two things right here on facebook ads work like gangbusters and you should really check out my last video on how to design thumbnails because i have a little bit more insight when it comes to designing thumbnails because i have 500 000 subscribers on my youtube channel i know the algorithm works because i know how people click images and if you understand how to do that with your facebook images your youtube ad images you're going to do so much better when it comes to ctr and so i'm not going to talk about images right now but those are two things right there i see people just mess up all the time they tell people exactly what they're going to get there's no story to be completed and they they write the whole entire thing like this they just keep writing and they like write their entire message and then the message gets cut off by seymour and people on their mobile phones are not seeing the message they're not getting curiosity and their cpl goes up and it's just bonkers and they're sending people to landing pages created on landing page platforms that are slow they're driving their opt-ins through the roof next thing i want to show you on here and this only really applies to webinars and opt-in type funnels it's so easy if you simply go on your funnels and offer an extra bonus on this one i offer a copy and paste tracking script to accomplish this right here but one thing that really increased our opt-in rates at hcom which was my info business i took the eight figures last year is what i also offered was a cheat list of the best products if you go in there and you make your big headline and then you offer just a small bonus you don't want to have a bonus that completely replaces the need to opt in but if you offer something on top of it so for example in our age commands i said we're going to show you exactly how we built the shopify store and got to this level and also if you come and check this out we're going to give you a list of the most high converting products online right now that you can be selling doing that right there just dramatically increased our opt-ins we didn't change anything just instantly the opt-in rates increased by 10 so we went from 30 to closer to 40 percent and that doesn't seem huge 10 seems small but that's actually a 25 ish it's a very large increase it's a 30 increase almost on the amount of people coming to the funnel that's huge that's huge it's almost one-third more customers coming in that increases the entire business just doing something simple like that can just change everything another little tip that i'm going to show you that really helped our opt-ins whenever you put in an image right here don't put an image of yourself looking professional in a suit that's what everybody does looking like everybody else never works for anybody at least when you want to get to higher levels that's just some general advice right there but what i find works really quickly is you create an image that looks like a video is about to be played that creates curiosity people love charts and graphs this is not a large lee applicable piece of advice but if you can go and get charts and graphs in your content people always want to know what's going on in charts and graphs i can watch wistia videos and the attention goes up whenever a graph comes up or a chart you ad runners love graphs and charts anyways having this right here with the play button right here people click that like crazy and then once a person has clicked it and became began the action chain they're usually going to go and type in their email all right so it's really just about getting this click on this page and so this is a really kind of kind of coy way tongue-in-cheek way to get the click and it works it works final thing i'm going to give you try ugly pages or at least split test them this page right here is terrible so ugly but when i go look at most people's opt-ins it looks like we're going and signing up to go to an elon musk tesla convention okay it's it's ridiculous and i'm not saying ridiculous to be rude or saying that it's stupid i'm saying it's ridiculous because i know it doesn't convert as well because i've tested almost every single type of opt-in and landing page there is these ugly white background blank text pages just convert higher i would use a different page if something else convert higher because frankly i don't like these pages i want my pages to look nice and hot and sexy but this always converts higher because really the most important thing when it comes to ads is readability and that the person understands what they're looking at that's really it that's truly really it and so what i suggest you do with your opt-in pages or your ads is try using really simple pages if you look at amazon it looks terrible but there's no way it's not the most optimized form of a page okay no one really comes and looks at a page that says oh man this doesn't look good or not when they're making those knee-jerk decisions maybe when it comes to like researching something you go to apple's website they have beautiful pages go to you know any other cool website of their beautiful pages purple.com is an example however when people are making knee-jerk decisions you need to just give them the information so they can make the knee-jerk decision as fast as possible because knee-jerk decisions aren't done through thought they're done like that you're walking through the the line at let's say target you see a candy bar you pick it up you go okay this always converts significantly that being said guys that's the train for today those are a couple things that have just dramatically improved my roi it take almost no effort to do real quickly if you want to see how to track your ads like i talked about before how to make sure that you're working with the right data just go schedule a hi-ros call with us below we will actually analyze your ad account and make sure that one you actually have the ability to do this and it's a good fit for you and that you will actually see an roi if you start tracking like this and we'll even show you

i've showed you right here because at high risk we have a 90 day refund guarantee that means if you don't see these results and you don't make more money we don't make any more money on top that i mentioned my consulting mastermind where i basically walk people through all my ads and funnels and everything i've done to scale my if you're interested in applying for that or you want to hear more
