hey there you scuzzball internet marketer you sleazy snake oil selling Shiller of garbage on the internet welcome back to my ads Channel where we talk about ads do you want to know the number one thing to make your ads super profitable and make them sh money if you nail this one thing your ads will make infinite amounts of money you could actually become quite rich just doing this one thing well and messing up everything else do you want to know what it is it's making the place you send them AKA your sales pages and landing pages it's making those convert highly and I know this might come as a shocking revelation that in order to get people to buy stuff from you online after they click an that you have toing convince them you you have to convince them well getting a person to click and add is the easy part getting someone to actually believe the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're saying on your website take out their credit card or put in their information or give you their phone number and do what you want them to do that's the hard part because people don't trust you online and they are very very busy and have the attention span of a gerbal so truly the actual most important thing if you want to make a lot of money on the internet via ads you could mess up pretty much everything else in fact running ads is pretty easy right now with the targeting it doesn't take a space age scientist like it used to the number one thing by far is being able to create pages and websites to convince people to do what you want and in this video I'm going to break down a skill set and strategy that has been forgotten to time since genz and Millennials have taken over the internet and no one has the ability to read anymore this is a skill set that absolutely no one has internet marketing and that's being able to write written sales Pages no one can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do this anymore except for me I'm the only source of information on the entire internet you have just kidding but not really the only information that I can really think up on coming to writing wrden sales pages is back in Old Dan Kennedy books and classic copywriting books no one does this anymore yet if you go to Every website every SAS website every e-commerce website any website online what is going on there people aren't watching videos they are interacting with visuals images text text links the website design and that's what's convincing them to buy and nobody understands how to go and make this actually convince people to do this if you can do this everything will work cuz people aren't watching videos on your websites they are reading and so if you understand how to get people who are reading to do what you want you're going and I can tell you how to do this because I built multiple eight figureure businesses fueled by ads I've built a ninef figureure business fueled by ads I'm going to show you a sales page today that generates 50,000 to 100,000 plus per day in sales and on top of that I'm the CEO of one of the largest ad tracking companies in the world right now hros you should use it if you don't you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] which allows me to see what is working across all of paid advertising to the tune of billions of dollars I see everything that's going on I can tell you what's working what I'm about to show you right here is actually pretty uncommon in ads and I'm going to show you this page that I've created for my business and I'm going to walk you through everything I'm doing that has allowed me to create my website for my business that I guarantee you converts much much higher than all my competitors or similar websites there's only like two websites out there online that I think have really good written copywriting on them for example one of them is clickfunnels because Russell Brunson is a copywriting freak the other one is Alex Hero's website really other good copywritten website that we'll probably review later on we're going to start with my website if you just apply this strategy and mindset that I give you you're going to see your conversion Skyrocket because you're probably just not doing this by default it's like if you were trying to learn how to play soccer and you stop hitting the ball with your hand and getting penalties like kick it with your foot you stupid son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's how simple this is and that's how little people do this so let's hop over let me break down this page for you all right so nor on my business hos.com and this business was recently about last valuation we got was valued over $150 million I think it's worth much more because we've grown a lot from then but regardless of that this is a business page that has generated a lot of money for me it's created a very successful business so you can pretty much assume that this works so what I'm going to do right here is I'm going to break down this page now look I would I try not to Shield hyros too much in this Channel and that might be what this comes across but I put more effort into this page and this website than anything else I have online at the moment so I have no better use case or example to show you so you're also going to have to deal with me subtly Shilling hyrus as we walk through this I want to break down the mythology behind this first so so what we're going to do is we're going to go through these notes that I've left right here in this very badly organized area right here so let's start from the very beginning of everything we need to do with the sales page and we'll go through the actual steps and what the person is thinking so all copywriting is and all selling through written text or video is achieving these goals right here okay so you have to make sure that someone believes or you have to Market to the person what they're looking for these are all going to sound really obvious but people don't do these things so please if you think you're smart and you think oh well obviously you want to sell to People based on what they want okay great why aren't you doing it correctly so there's three things you really have to get done one you have to make sure that the person uh on the page AG is there for what they want and you're selling them what they want and you have to know what they want to sell them so what is the big thing to them you didn't have to convince them that what you're selling is actually for them and is going to work and then you have to convince them to take action those are the three things you have to do that's all there really is but doing those things is a little bit harder than just breaking it down the three things and what you're really trying to do is predict once you have those things allocated okay you have the right person on the page and you're selling what they want you have to predict what they're going to think it's like you're having a conversation with someone and you're trying to lay out a game of chess 20 moves and predict every move they're going to make and everything they're going to think you're not just writing and throwing something out into the void it'd be like if you're talking to a girl or something like that I don't know if you've ever seen pickup artists or people who have these whole scriptive routines to talk to women but what you're trying to again do is predict everything the person's going to say in response to what you're saying so you're going to say for example if I'm selling hyos hey I have this tracking solution it's going to make you more money from ads what's the first thing the person going to say how does it do that how do I know it works then I'm going to give them a response okay well here's a customer that got this result right here and here's how it works well yeah but I don't really believe it yet well here's more testimonials well how would this actually work for me blah blah blah blah blah blah all right and so if you ever look at any sales video or heck when I'm making even videos on YouTube what I'm trying to do is I communicate something to people and about every 15 seconds I think what is the person going to think what are they going to respond what's going to be going on in this person head what's the objection or skepticism they're going to have and then I address that and so I'm constantly having a conversation with someone that isn't actually there that I'm imagining that's the key to copyrighting people just talk to themselves and then they lose track of the conversation they having with the person so think about that as you go through this so we have to think about these things before the person comes on the page what is the big thing and what is the main big thing what you see a lot of times when people come on pages is they try and pitch different things you have to understand people are very short attention spendy imagine you're having a conversation with someone who is using their phone and texting someone else and their wife is screaming at them uh if he their text message so they're very distracted right now what is the number one way we can convince them what is the thing that's going to hook them through because you don't have to hook a person on 15 different things you just have to hook them on their main thing people usually only buy something for one or two reasons for example if you're selling a skin cream uh you could have a skin cream that tightens your skin removes wrinkles gets rid of AC me whatever but what you want to do when you send people to a page is you need to understand what is the biggest fing reason they're on the page right now so if you ran an ad and your skin product does 10 different things but you're in an ad focusing on acne just go 100% on acne scars that's the only thing you have on the page just nail it nail it nail it because you're sending people interested in acne scar treatment and that's the only thing you need to nail you can also bring other things into it but they all must relate back to the main thing so if we go look at this page at hyos what are we focusing on right here scale scale scale and if you go through this entire page you're just going to see the word scales over and over again all the testimonials result to scaling and so at highis I understand the number one thing that people buy it for is because they want to scale their ads they want to make more money yes we cut cost yes we cut waste yes we help the targeting improve on Facebook yes we help people attribute their sales more correctly those are not the number one thing that's going on in someone's said the number one reason why people buy hus or look at hus is cuz want their ads to scale further so what I focus on is how hyos does that and guarantees that result if you see everything right here I tie every feature that hyros has on the page back to scaling so before we even get into the words we're saying what is the main thing the customers came for and then we're going to attach everything back on the page the customer Journey the attribution the AI optimization high it's all going to tie back to that so whatever your product does whatever your features do tie it back to the main big thing and only focus on the main big thing on the page okay next what are their biggest objections you got to collect these beforeand why are people not buying your product so for example at highes people's biggest objection is it's hard to plug in I don't have time to do it I don't believe it works yada yada what you're always going to see 90% of the time is people are going to require more proof they're not going to believe you okay there's the pain or time of setup or use okay and there's the friction to join now friction and joy mean how hard is it to check out how hard is it to get into what you're doing so for example at hyos we we charge upfront you know a lot of times you can remove friction by making it free or making it easy to join or there's all sorts of other things we can talk about as we get into that but most of the time what are their biggest objections proof pain and time of use so have all the reasons why people don't buy and don't complete check out don't make the next step don't believe you and you must attack those okay so why would people not believe that hires can scale their ads why do people believe they can't set it up why are they not joining maybe they don't understand it so moving on to the understand part I just put into can a fourth grader understand it what you must do is you must not just only focus on the big thing you must explain to the person and explain away their objections and convince them of the big thing in a way that is easy for them to understand I see so many pages for example I look at other attribution companies and it looks like a PhD scientist wrote their page I don't know what the f the company actually does or how it tracks or how it makes them more money I go to so many other service websites and like that that's not explain the big thing and it's not making it simple can they understand it can someone look at your page and understand what's happening next we have to focus on what type of customer are they and how do we get sniper info to them so for example at hyos what I do and what I understand is that first everybody that comes to this website wants to scale their ads but I have many different types of customers as do you I have e-commerce customers I have SAS customers I have people that run info businesses I have people that track phone calls okay and so hus has very specific functionality for each of those type of businesses that makes our tracking Superior for them but what a lot of people try and do with their products is they try to Market them all at once so they have e-commerce features they have infom marketing features they have testimonials that are for all different types of business models this is not what we want to do here once we convince people that it can scale what we want to do is we want to send people to specific information so what you want to do on your site is once you have let's say we have a skin cream okay what we want to do is we want to convince people that the skin cream works and then what we might want to do if we don't go for the sale right away is we want to send people to relevant information that applies them so maybe they're interested in skin tightening maybe they're interested in acne scarring um a better example with this would be on a B2B website where you're trying to make the business more money okay so on that on that skincare example right there I would just go straight in and the acne scarring like we talked about or whatever the main thing is and then maybe maybe narrow it down to more specific things like blackhead scarring or um I don't I don't know the specifics of skin care scarring to be honest uh potholes sunburn damage something like that and you could narrow it down to that if the person needs more information okay so an example of that just thinking off the top of my head is if you have the sales page for your skin cream you could actually have it like what is your biggest problem Sun scarring acne scarring you got hit by a baseball bat I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know you then link them to deeper parts of the site to get the more information or you provide information based on that so as I go down here after I convince the person yes it will scale you the first thing I'm trying to do is get them information based on their specific needs okay so for example if they're like in e-commerce I'm going to show them big e-commerce brands that are getting results I'm going to show them how our cogs and the way that we attribute the entire hard cost of goods all in one place while attributing higher for scaling is going to help them more if we're doing call tracking I'm going to focus on how it's able to connect the call to the close months later and connect all the backup sales and all the attribution from the sales reps to one place you can attribute that back to your ads that's what I'm going to focus on based on the customer and I don't want to just Chun it all in one page I want to Route them there so if you can see when I go and click on features at the top of the page how we split up by features now you might have noticed I'm not talking about any written sales copy yet I haven't gone to like called Dan Kennedy how to write a sales page I'm you what I'm talking about right here is how to structure your website there has to be a logical flow to how people are going to behave on your website if you go to any other website let's just go like look at MailChimp or something something like that and the reason why I'm using MailChimp is the more corporate and large a business is the more aloof and stupid their websites are so like look at these look at the website and just TR an email and SMS in the revenue get more op clicks to your email marketing this is all fine but like look how many different directions is going right here like on the page itself just all over the place Solutions and services like it just like there's it's just so much information now this is a terrible example cuz I'm terrible at making content you can probably MailChimp is like this big Enterprise giant service and when you get to the size of this you're probably going to need all these these crazy winging extra features right here I'm just saying that a lot of smaller businesses more like hyusis size or B2B businesses or other businesses that are are not quite the level of MailChimp they're all over the place with all sorts of information if you can look at the hyro website there's really nowhere for you to get lost you're going to find exactly what you're looking for and there's nowhere else you can get jug into other sites have like their whole entire site listed up here 10 different places you can go there is very little places for you to end up based on your business model on here okay so are you looking for the features are you looking for results I'll I'll bring this down so you can see the taskbar right here and there's really no other place for you to get lost okay so we want to direct them to the sniper information that's related to them on the page and then finally what are the key concerns specific to this customer that's very basic if I go right here and I click on e-commerce you're going to see a page that has only things that are related to e-commerce you're going to see we're using e-commerce Brands like Playboy uh we're using e-commerce influencers like Matt Smith and we're showing the results of e-commerce stores and focusing all the features on here with their specific business models like we connected to Amazon you're not going to see this on the info marketing page so that's what we're going to be looking at the sales videos everything right here like the biggest day in in e-commerce is Black Friday so I focus on videos that show we increased profits by Black Friday or on Black Friday by 60% for a lot of users so this is what I'm going to focus on but if I go right here on the SAS page completely other different stuff we're focusing on Mr and how this ties in the ARR and how we actually track LTV back to ad so different problems for different customers but the main focus of the entire everything is always scaling this is going to be about how to scale your e-commerce ads and so you have to look at the train of thought what's going on right here so if we go back and look at this let's go back and do this from the very top and then let's look at how we do the copywriting on the page so what's the topic or problem what's the big thing it's scaling okay everything on the hrus website or anything on your website should focus on the main thing again this isn't a pitch for hyros I'm explaining how I sell hyros so you understand how to sell your product this is Apples the apples you can copy and paste this method over to your product so what's the topic or problem what's the big problem for the customer scaling that's the number one thing that's important to people that will potentially use hus they want to make more money what is the number one thing to your customer okay so the first thing a person is going to think then is this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't believe you this is the number one thing and then what's going to happen is you sell to anybody on the internet every 30 seconds they're going to think this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't believe you until you've smashed any form of skepticism out of their mind so you're going to see on the page here's the big giant result and there's a video very quickly breaking down like how we get it with hrus and so I love these little gif animated videos at the top of websites because people don't watch videos cuz they have the ADHD of a crazy chimpan on qu ludes right now it's they don't they don't watch five minute videos they just can't do it okay they also don't read long forms of text they read chunky chunky text just like the way they read Twitter and Instagram and so what I do is I make gifts they very quickly show them exactly what they're going to get and focus on the most important part which is scaling all this ties back in the scaling shows the most important features so I love using these at the top of websites because they're perfect for ADHD people now the first thing a person's going to think is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm like well here's Tony Robbins using it it's obviously probably not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here's like a billion other brands okay moving on so that's the first thing I'm going to do you want to get endless proof and so what I do also is I put trust pilot on here um and then also there's people that their number one thing to buy is just going to be proof which is why you should always just have a results page so what we have at hyros literally if the person is just wants to call [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on me all day I just have an entire page being like no here's like a billion results testimonials people making more money here's endless videos here's famous people here's normal Brands here's whatever this is why it's also really important you build something that actually works so you can do this if your product doesn't consistently work you have tons of bad reviews online you should really address that first um a lot of people are be like what if I don't have a lot of testimonials and no one gets results with my product fix that first okay you you'd be shocked how many people that's like their main problem I know it's crazy but building a business that actually works and gets results and makes more money than they pay you like that that is actually one of the big Keys the business and behold um but anyways just endless results and I give people results in every type of format that they're looking for this is essential for copyrighting because people take in results in different ways so I have videos showing them how it works plus endless results I have more traditional here's a review site oh you don't believe review sites here's normal people oh you don't believe normal people you think we copy paste it here's famous people uh that we could get in trouble for posting on here if they didn't say these things they they mess us up like Dan Henry message me and be like hey I didn't say that well you know that this is true well here's also like thousands of people also use our brand here's a bunch of other famous people you know here's people just like you so I'm thinking about the person watching the page like maybe it's an e-commerce person well here's e-commerce [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all right maybe you're an infom marketer or maybe you take calls well here's the person getting calls this is why you always want a results page you should just always have a giant results page for your products or anything on your site okay cuz there's all people the number one reason why they won't buy is just proof of results then after We've Ended endlessly proven that it's real they're going to think okay it's real but what the how does it actually you know get me these results what we then want to do is we want to explain in fourth grade format how it does it so you can see I don't like write a long biography like a lot of sites do and like all the scientific things hus is the highest level of AD tracking it's just big simple chunky text now it requires zero changes to your business you paste our code data accuracy Skyrock your ad scale you can see how I just explained the product in three bite-sized chunks okay so this right here I love this type of format on a page because it just this is how a person reads this is what it does it doesn't have any of the things you hate it's simple to use we guarantee it that's the entire pitch on this page and I repeat that over and over again and you can see how I'm communicating with the person so let's let's go through the conversation we're having scale your business I don't believe you well here's trust pilot and here's how it works okay but I still don't believe it well here's Tony Robins okay maybe it's kind of real how does it actually work well what it does is this is how it gets you the result and by the way it doesn't require any of those things that you hate and your ads will get this result if you do this here's the result you'll get again this is all you have to do it's very simple it's push button and we guarantee it well that sounds really cool but I still don't believe you okay well here's more here's more results H okay so this is the conversation we're going back and forth with the person you can see how I confirm results every couple seconds as the person Scrolls down so the person might still need a little bit convincing on how the product actually works so what I do is I always break things in the threes because the human mind works in threes one thing there's no Trend two thing there's not a trend three things there's a trend five things it's over combobulated so I try to keep things in threes and fours threes preferably so at this point the person probably needs more details so what I do is I repeat the same exact process over again here is how it works okay here's the result you're going to get boom click here continue more testimonials now again three ways where we'll increase your Adar why again the person's more interested in scaling another set of Threes so what I'm doing at this point right here is I've gone through what's the big problem we've addressed it how do they know it's real all right I know it's real but how does it get me this we've broken it down right here all right and then what the person is going to think next is okay I've heard thought about this in the past but I've never done it so the reason why people never use ad tracking is they think it's complicated it's going to be hard to set up you can see that's why I focus on it being simple Now hrus isn't incredibly simple to set up but the amount of customer support and how simple we've made a system it's by far the best support and simplest there is online which is the main reason why people never set up tracking so think about why don't people use skin care products why don't people use your gym products why don't people use your courses why don't they why don't they use your service why Haven they done in the past what is the thing that stopped them other than the money or the the financials of it you want to address that as you go through the page in these patterns you can constantly see I'm constantly addressing that it's way easier to set up than anything else once we've accomplished these things you can accomplish this on your page pretty quickly you can see I accomplish all these things within a few Scrolls what we then want to do on our pages is get people the specific information immediately immediately so what I didn't do the rest of the page is really focus on repeating this process I go and give people information specific to them and then I I focus on a few more features that are based around scale and then I show them more proof and then I try to get them the features that are specific to them because really what happens with hris is they come to this page and they get finally convinced that we'll make them more money but how will it make them specifically more money this acne product will um stop your acne but how it will specifically stop your forms of acne because you have specific problems so what are your three most common types of customers if you have an acne product or something like that B2B I don't know so I get them to the information that's related to them so these are all of our most common types of customers there's also again just at the top hey do you just straight up not believe us here's results so we get them to for example e-commerce and then I walk them through all the results we got for e-commerce stores all the specific procs how we're the only ones that track Amazon Tik Tok shop all that and we're able to track the LTV and subscriptions and all their cost in one place and we dig into that kind of stuff right there and so we get them and I repeat the same exact process that we did before what's the main problem to an e-commerce store they want to scale but they also have these very specific little tiny problems in their business as well this is where we get into the minute now that we actually know who our Target customer is and we got a very specific customer to a specific page now we can start drilling down on their specific needs finally what the person is going to think last as of all is okay but where's the catch what's what's the risk to me here I have to give you my credit card and I'm going to have to take a big risk what I like to do here is I always like to offer a crazy guarantee to get people um across the board and and when it comes to purchasing so on any of my businesses I just offer crazy refund guarantees because if your business let's imagine you have a lifetime refund guarantee of your of your business if 20% of people are refunding your product you really have something there's there's a problem with your product you should have really re low refund rates regardless and refund rates shouldn't tank your business okay so what I like to do is I just like to offer crazy guarantees risk-free guarantees of their business that's the easiest way to remove the catch if you can't do that find some way to remove the risk for the customer on your page then finally the person's going to think okay I'll come back later cuz no one wants to reach into their pocket and take out their credit card give them some reason to act now the price increasing some limited scarcity or just double triple down on pain I don't really like to use too much scarcity or specials or promos at because then they stop having effect in the future I do do specials and promos there a lot of you internet marketers have like tons of false scarcity on your websites and whatnot that works by all means if you want to treat your customer like an idiot and your customers are idiots then do it okay I used to do that stuff in the past I stopped doing it because what happens is people can't Coy to that or your specials lose their effect in the future you only want to use specials or go for the crazy right hooks every now and then that's my two sents that what I like to do to get someone to take action now is I like to just really double down on the pain for example at hris they're just losing more money they're losing more money on ads there's absolutely no risk you can have this set up tomorrow and if you set up tomorrow you'll be making more money today you're choosing to make less money and lose money if you don't set up right now something like that just remember this is the process of the flow of the conversation so I'm going to post this in the description below this is the process and flow I follow with every sales page sales video everything in fact if you watch my YouTube videos or even these videos especially in the first five minutes I'm constantly assuming the person wants to click away so for example on my crypto videos what people are really reallying into and come into the channels they want little micro coin picks they want me to pick coins for them throw coins at them and then they uh then they buy them and a lot of people come to the channel supposedly because they want to catch the coins early get into the coins and then dump on people who buy the coins from the channel I'm fully aware of this in the crypto channel so what I constantly do is I use that promise that I'm going to pick coins the string them along to the actual important content that I want to pick out and I constantly knock out their objections at the beginning of the videos by showing the proof of the results of the coins I got so the people get hooked and they stay through the video and actually watch the content the good quality content I want them to watch for the promise of these coins that I constantly use in the hook so really if you watch the Youtube video the sales pitch is to get them to watch the end of the video okay so you can use this in any form of persuasion whether it's getting people to watch videos to opt in to buy products from you this conversation happens over and over and over again so you can use this process and virtually anything this is how you do it in the form of a website which is by far the most important thing because the thing that sells everything you have the thing that people return to organically the thing that people browse around from when they're thinking about buying decisions and they didn't buy from your ad initially and your initial ads page is your website most people don't focus on their website that much they focus on the ad or the initial page they land in and they don't think about how people are interacting with their websites or how they view their brand and it shows so use this I beg of you if you like content like this subscribe and you should use hrus also because of all the things I talked about it's if you run ads it's so stupid not to be using it we guarantee the result and uh I'll see you in the next video
