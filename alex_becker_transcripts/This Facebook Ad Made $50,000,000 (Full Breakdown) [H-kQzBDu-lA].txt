================================================================================

all right guys today on this channel where we talk about ads i'm going to show you the most profitable ad funnel i've ever seen on facebook i'm pretty sure i'm not going to give the exact number but this funnel did anywhere between 50 and 100 million dollars worth of sales and it is extremely simple the reason why i want to show you this funnel is because i see people trying to do all sorts of crazy things on facebook they have like these crazy book funnels and there's a wizard widget there's like surveys it blows my mind because that doesn't work what works is what i'm about to show you right here and i copy this exact process with hieros and that's one of the reasons why we're the fastest growing ad analytics sas company in the entire world that sounds like a doozy to say and i'm blown away by it too but it's true that being said let me just show you this funnel and break down why it works so well so you can take the reasons why it works because most people don't understand this is a pretty famous funnel actually and then you can take why it works and apply it to your funnel and hopefully get good results too because good results are pretty cool right all right let's get into it oh let's look at this and so today i'm going to be reviewing uh actually a good friend of mine alex from rosie's funnel and i'm sure it'd be fine with me looking at this because it's a pretty famous funnel but the reason why i love this right here is because it reflects that your strategy and offer are so much more important than your funnel okay so for example if you've ever seen the hi-ros funnel that we have it's literally a one-page call funnel okay and it does six to 10x rois like clockwork this is another example one of those funnels so let's just start from the ad there's nothing really special about this ad right here okay you can just simply see basic ad um really basic things that they've gotten right with this this funnel right here um the most important thing is going and posting uh results of your customers in the comments section this does pretty well it helps increase the ad uh basically just going over the results of a client right here now the text and everything i'm not really going to read through the picture all right it's mostly a retargeting ad the main thing i want to get at right here is the funnel because this funnel right here has done i i think maybe there's one other funnel on all of click funnels that's done more sales okay and it's like a i think a solar panel company if we're looking at just good old-fashioned info marketing funnels this thing has beaten every single person on planet earth and it's kind of weird because if you look at it it's a super basic funnel okay now personally i'm going to tell you straight up i'm going to tell you straight up i think if you look at my landing page and funnel design videos with how this page is designed how the headline works and everything i think mine are much better okay but that being said what i want to emphasize right here is how simple the funnel is okay if you look at most funnels you have a picture of someone you know riding a unicorn in a suit on stage talking with batman okay what all right you can see right here this is i want to get this through your head as you watch this video that funnels that work are simple for example if you look at my funnel right the hi-res funnel i i very much uh replicated the the gym launch funnel i made it as simple as possible there's a video where the call to action is two minutes in and it goes down to the bottom right here where they can book a call okay and there's no opt-in there's no anything so what i'm gonna stress right here is as you're making your funnels the first lesson i can show you as we look at this funnel is keep your funnel simple try to do less try to remove steps try not to add things i see people try to add like a book and in a survey and in an upsell down cell funnel number one take away first and foremost run simple funnels why because simple things are easy to optimize and simple things generate simple results and when you have a simple result and your your math problem is 2 plus 2 instead of 2 divided by 5 to the power of 16 times 11 it's a lot easier just to play with the the knot the the the toggles and the nozzles and the the widgets you need to do that for example if you're working with a computer that only has two buttons it's gonna be a lot easier to work with those two buttons and it's gonna be 50 buttons i explain that terribly but you get what i'm saying so we go in you can see this is all very basic stuff there where should we send your case study all right you can see i'm just going to go in and put in a basic email just nice basic opt-in right here so the thing i love most about this is it goes straight for the kill okay and this is what you really need to take away from this a lot of the pre-selling for this is actually done in the ad itself and it's so targeted that really there's no reason for alex in this ad really to make a big sales video because what people are signing up for and if you understand your customer coming in and you understand the context of their click this is the next big lesson context matters far more than marketing tactics i see a lot of people they put up a sales video or they have a webinar or they have some presentation regardless of the context of who's clicking so for example let me explain this a little bit clear away and um alex says it really well right here but in my funnel i know that i'm advertising the people that run ads and if you run ads you know every single type of popular funnel there is and you also know all the the marketing tactics and know that they're a little bit bs okay uh you you probably aren't gonna fall for them okay if i put up a webinar a pre-recorded webinar you're gonna know it's a pre-recorded webinar if i put up a sales video with all sorts of scale scarcity tactics you're going to know i'm using scarcity taxes you're going to recognize them if i put up an opt-in you know if you put in your email i'm probably going to start blasting you with an email follow-up chain as a marketer you know this as a person that runs ads you know this so i don't attempt to do that because i know you know that and i'm going to think what is the best way to convince you to do something the best way to convince you to do something is first off don't talk to you like you're an idiot okay so if i'm running like a health funnel all right and these are people looking to i don't know lose weight they're probably not familiar with marketing tactics so a our scarcity tactics could be well placed in that event using marketing tactics on marketers is just a great way of saying it's lying to someone's face so if i were to go up to you and for example the the sam ovens clothes is a very popular phone clothes everybody knows what that clothes is and when people start doing it the people that know what the clothes is it gets super awkward okay it's this clothes where people uh you basically are silent a lot of the time now this works on people that don't know what the clothes is but people that do know what the clothes is it's just weird okay it's like it's like going up to a girl at a bar uh that's heard the same pickup line 50 times and using the same pickup it's just disrespectful of the person's iq that's not me telling you how to market that's me telling you the context and understanding of my customers i know a person is coming right here is a marketer probably runs ads probably makes a good amount of money they're not going to watch this entire sales video because they're busy and they make a lot of money i haven't watched a sales video in half a decade i'm not imagining anybody else's so i make the call to action super and in this video and i also make what's happening on the page super clear so they can just scroll down and see everything super quickly see all the massive brands that use high roast the results that people get doubling their rois on ads tripling uh at least growing it by fifteen twenty percent you should use high rose by your ads by the way we guarantee it will increase your ad revenue by 15 and 20 percent or you don't pay it's insane if you run ads without it just letting you know again but i really know this person isn't going to fall for marketing tactics and they just want to get to the point so i get to the point on the page and i also give them ways to figure out uh exactly how they need to be sold to so i show them different points of software and i don't use any long drawn out pitch i don't use marketing tactics i don't use scarcity and i really shoot straight with them take that monologue aside you can see alex is doing literally just that right there okay with his funnel right here he just goes straight for the application because the person coming right here what's there to talk about he's gonna make their gym more money what's there to say they clicked here to make more money from their gym why does it need a sales video it doesn't if you go to any other funnel out there you got you got this crazy sales venue a guy in a suit walk around hd alex lilly just sticks an epin form right here this thing nukes it why because what's there to talk about what's where's there to get distracted just fill out the application we'll make you more money what he does right here is something you see me do a lot right here endless amounts of results okay he shows tons and tons and tons of results and so here's my little piece third piece of advice right here when you're not going for a sale you're mainly going to collect a lead or get a phone call you really don't need to sell too much you just have to you have to create intrigue or curiosity so what's going on yeah we got an application but why would this person not fill out this application what are they going to do what's the number one reason why they won't fill this out this is again why you need to know your customer in context because context matters they're not going to fill it out what's the first thing going to do they're going to keep scrolling well he's going to show them tons of results and then here's alex literally going to like a billion results into bonuses there's no debate that this product works then he shows himself with authoritative figures in the gym space you've got arnold schwarzenegger and all these people right here yaya so what do i do all right you come down here you're not going to book a call with me i'm going to think i'm going to in context i know you're going to think two things what is print tracking so i explain that first and i show the endless results and then i show authoritative figures using our software this is enough to get people to go you know what they guarantee it i sort of get what it is there's so many results everyone i know is using this okay i'm going to book a call i guarantee that's what most people do i can look at the watch time in this video only 30 percent of people watch this video so another thing you need to take away from this sales videos aren't that effective in calls funnels they are effective to an extent okay but they're not not 100 of people are watching your videos so it's another takeaway from this funnel and and the thing i like about this funnel again is it emphasizes all these points by being so bare bone okay people have been trying to replicate this thing and replicate alex's results they can't figure out why why i'm doing all these things i'm doing i have a magic book fun on all these things and this guy's whomping me with this here's the last secret when alex originally launched this there was no one else selling gym growth like this okay there's and the reason why it works really well right now is alex just has more results than anybody on planet earth but there's no one selling it like he made a unique offer that worked literally every single time and i'm going to tell you here's the most important thing about hiros and the most important thing about the reason why this offer grew and why this ad works like gangbusters is because when they bring a person on to their business their their clients always get results now this is going to sound so stupid your the best way your proc is going to grow is from word of mouth ads are meant to be the start of a snowball okay your business should pick up momentum the more people buy from ads and then you should be able to turn off your ads at some point it will still make money for example about fifty percent of the sales at hiros are organic i can turn off my ads for two weeks and we will still do phenomenal numbers why is that well it's because we've been running ads for almost a year and a half we've got tons of people in and we have thousands of customers in and for every customer you get we get two more customers referred by them usually same thing with alex's gym launch people would come in and they would consistently get incredible results so there's two things you need to understand about this you need to have a unique offer that is something that people desperately want okay there's nothing really like this in a gym area okay high risk for example there's nothing that really solves the problem that hyrus solved initially i'm sure there'll be copycats and there's a few other businesses but they're not really marketing well okay and that's not a dig at those businesses if you're one of our competitors i'm not going to grow my business by talking smack about you i'm going to grow my business by focusing on my customer i'm not here to trash your business that being said the reason why harris is growing is because originally it was just a very unique offer there's nothing else out there that can fix the problems that hiros can and the ways that we do it as consistently and we started running ads with high-risk ads weren't that effective but as hiros became a more recognized brand and the results became more well-known ads work like crazy now i i could it's impossible for me not to make money on these ads okay so on top of that too focus on your product if you want your ads to work better when we're marketing especially in these industries you see all these people that come in they have really good ad campaigns and they go up and they go down why because you run out of you run out of buyers the bad word of mouth gets out there eventually your business has to grow through word of mouth okay apple doesn't run that many ads compared to how many people come in their store your business has to eventually grow through word of mouth now here's the final tip i can give you two final tips alex's products is expensive hiros is expensive if you want to make your ads work well on facebook with your funnels sell expensive products i've talked about this in every video so far the numbers just simply work out the numbers work much better if you're selling a ten thousand dollar product versus a eighty dollar product why because if let's say you send a thousand people in at five dollars per click and you get one of those people to buy a ten thousand dollar product you're profitable if you get a hundred if you get a seven percent conversion rate on a twenty dollar product something around the number numbers barely even work out and that's an insane conversion rate sell expensive products final thing the reason why harris works so well is because it's reoccurring okay if if we run our ads and it break in people we break even on our ads we're still going to make tons of money on the back end so much money in the back end okay if i spend ten thousand dollars to get a uh a customer that pays five thousand dollars up front i'm still probably going to make about four to five thousand dollars profit i don't pay anywhere near that to get that type of customer okay so i can pay you know five thousand dollars get a five thousand dollar customer make ten thousand dollars profit no problem easy i can pay so much to get a customer if you look at this funnel right here one of the things that gym launch does exceptionally well is they have a very very deep back and i'm not going to explain that to you um but jim launch has so many things that they also help gym owners with that are also high ticket as well so even if they break even on this initial sale right here they make so much money in their back end so they can spend they can just be very reckless with these ads and this funnel doesn't even have to be that tight up front all right it can be kind of a reckless funnel that just builds the brand because it's all in the back end okay so that's this funnel review and the reason why i want to do this i wanted to share with you that the most profitable funnels you're going to see usually the most simple ones they're usually the easiest ones and what they all share in common is they're usually pretty simple there's a excessive results the product is a unique offer and the product has a phenomenal back end that's it it's not something that's going to go on on your facebook ad it's not something that's going to go on magically in your funnel you're not going to change the headline like find some secret survey you can add in there that's going to blow it up every person i know that's made 50 plus million dollars the funnels aren't that complicated they're very simple to get the difference is the offer the product the results the testimonials of course that come with the results and understanding the context of the customer that's extremely important too that's it guys this is the training i have for you today this is probably
