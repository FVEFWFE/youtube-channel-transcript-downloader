Dude, the feminist, they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] won. Looking at these stats right here, if you're a man in America who wants to be successful, which I assume you are because you're watching these videos, it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're screwed, man. And I'm sure you're somewhat aware of this. It's why you're probably pessimistic and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all the time, which is why you see the title of this video, how to beat 99% of men, and you're super skeptical that in the next 13 minutes, I can show you how to do that. And frankly, I get why you think like that when we go through these stats and these metrics right here that's happened. It's bad. And I know what you're thinking. And this douchebag in front of Lamborghini probably just wants to sell me some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No, I'm already [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm not going to sell you anything. And by all metrics, I've beat a 99% of men. I'm very rich. I bet the nine figure net worth in my early 30s. I've had a six-pack for a decade now. And I'm also happily married to an attractive woman who is nice to me. So, by all tangible metrics, I've beaten 99% of men. So, you better trust me. Six ways to your mom's chocolate milk cookies that Yeah, I can tell you how to do it. And it really comes down to one thing I'm going to show you in this video. And it's the one thing all these dudes that are suffering from these stats I'm about to go through are lacking. So [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pay attention for 10 minutes, please. Because what's happening to these guys, what's going to happen to you is dark. Look at these stats. This is ridiculous. I just went to chat GBT and said, "Chat GBT, how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are men in America?" I didn't actually ask that. It gave me a completely different picture. Got some really interesting links on that. I'm not going to say I didn't explore them, but that's off topic. So, we're not going to That's a totally other video. That's a very sexy video that we're gonna have in the future when I have more followers and you can unsubscribe. But looking at this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like right now, what is going on with you guys? And again, I have to solution to this, but let me let's judge and and laugh at men in America right now. One in three men under 30 haven't had sex in a year or ever. In 2008, 8% of men 18 to 24 were virgins. By 2018, the number has doubled to 27%. I guarantee now it's in like the 35% 40%. And among men 18 to 30, over 25% say they've never been in a serious relationship. But wait, wait, it gets dark, man. You guys just aren't not getting laid. Men under 40 are two to three times more likely to be addicted to porn, gaming, and substances. So, for the many of my followers, look guys, I love you all the same. I know you're 5'2 neck beards. I know hentai catg girls and sitting in your room smoking pot while rubbing butter on your belly is really your favorite thing to do. But come on, guys. We got to get it together. Heck, just looking at this right here, one in three men aged 25 to 34 live with their parents. And over four out of 10 men in the US is morbidly obese. One in three men, one in three men 18 to 39 are obese. And of all you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on dating apps, women are swiping right, which is accepting you 5% of the time. Look, I get why it's dark, man. After reading all that, I get why you guys are a little bit pessimistic these days. I get why you're a little bit edgy and why you're upset all the time because it clearly looks like the world is against you. And when you look at everything on the news, they hate men. When you look at women right now, they've changed and they hate men. Everywhere I go on my newsfeed right now, I'm just going to put a little newsfeed of mine on here. It is the war against men. The loneliness epidemic of men. Men are making less money than ever. It's harder to make money and make your way in the world than ever. the entire Democratic party has made it their mission to either me to you, make sure you're poor or make you feel bad for using the wrong pronouns or punish you for not being by. And so when you look at this total summary of everything that's happening to dudes right now and the effects of it, man, the world is is really bad for dudes right now. There is literally a war against men and uh they they're winning. And in this video, I'm going to fix all that. I'm going to fix it all actually in the next 10 seconds. But then I'm going to fix it, give you the thing to focus on. Just one thing. It's just one thing. It's one little thing and then I'm going to show you a few paths that you can do, things you need to do now if you're in your 30s or definitely extremely like immediately if you're in your 20s that will fix all of it. It will fix it all. You'll be fine. So, here's number one. Here's the big one. All right. Get get out your notebook over here. Write out your notebook. Get a Sharpie. It's going to be very big. You're only going to need to write one thing. Here it is. Who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Point number one. I'm going to give you a few simple things you will do that if you do, I promise you, you will beat 99% of men. Hands down. Easy. it won't be a problem. I'll even link you to videos right after this that are going to enable you to get rich. And I won't even sell you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] course or some mastermind or some Discord group where I try to teach you how to be a man. I'm not going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do that. I'm just going to fix it all in one video. And I'll show you to make money without selling a course either. I'll fix it all in couple videos. If your short Gen Z millennial brain can avoid the Tik Tok syndrome of clicking away here for a couple minutes, here's the thing you need to keep in mind. Who gives a point one as a man? It is. There's never been a time in society where your job was to sit around and care and take care of other men. Maybe when you get to some point of giant wealth or something like that like I'm doing now and helping you, but who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cares what the world is doing? There is an endless amount of men making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tons of money right now. I made [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tons of money already this year and there's absolutely nothing stopping you from doing that. Yeah, the whole entire world is throwing men down a bus and a lot of men are succumbing to the negativity that's being thrown at them. Does that mean you have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it? And does it mean the negativity is even that hard to deal with? Let me let me break one thing down for you right here. If you compare this time of being a man compared to any other time in society's history, it's technically easier than ever. Look, I know the 70s to the 2005s or whatever, it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome to be a man. Cuz not only were women out of the workforce, so you made all the money. There was no internet so you couldn't get metoed. There was no social media so you weren't having to compete against good-looking guys with six-pack women. They really only know the the immediate 150 200 dudes within their vicinity. Okay? So, if you were like the one dude that was like a seven or something, you were doing pretty well. Now, a seven is basically a two. If you go on Instagram, every girl is like, "Why don't why don't Zack Efron looks like this? Why don't you? Zack Efron has a million dollars. Why don't you?" So, yeah, it's it's the comparison and everything. It's it is pretty hard right now compared to like the ' 80s or 70s, but you go back maybe like 40 in the 40s or something like that. They were literally grabbing you and putting you on ships and sending you off to war. Like in the 50s or 70s, literally the average experience for a 20-year-old was you get kidnapped by the government and have to go to the jungle to fight in a mortal combat fight to the death against a bunch of angry Vietnamese people climbing in tunnels whose life goal was to light you on fire. Like, it's not that bad, first off, but secondly, just cuz 99% of other dudes are having a bad time, it doesn't mean you have to have a bad time. Look, I'm going to tell you something straight up. I made a ton of money this year. Since the age of 30, I've had a six-pack. When I was 20 years old, I was very, very bad at talking to women. I was an incredibly awkward [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] As you can see, I've totally become well adjusted in this day and age. If you look at Yeah, this is this is peak emotional maturity and stability right here. But ignore the fact I was bad at talking to women. I managed to fix that. I was in fact just a basket case. I was depressed all the time, drinking, watching the tits on the inner tube, smoking pot, doing all the things. And now I I don't. And I'm going to tell you what, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Joe Biden, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the woke the the woke cult, a bunch of purple-haired women, the the women from the view, they they didn't show up on my doorstep and stop me. Nothing. No one showed up to stop me. And so, the bigger point I have to I have to get into right now before all this as I scroll through my YouTube newsfeed constantly. constantly reading Charlie Kirk or whatever his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] name is telling me how hard it is to be a man and seeing Andrew Tate and all the other people and everybody in their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dog out there and all the ma fitness influencers and male uh alpha male influence telling me, "Oh, it's so hard being in war on men so dark right now. Women suck right now." Blah blah blah. Women have always sucked. When was when was there a time when there wasn't a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dudes who were not doing well in life that were mad that they weren't getting laid? Like women have never been nice to dudes first off. There was never like a time where you were in a bar like I I went up and I I lived back in the day where you'd have to approach women at bars. Trust me, they weren't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nice. If you were a short little 5'2 neck beard and you went approaching women at the bars with your little funky haircut, want to show them your Pokemon cards and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that, they weren't nice then either. Okay, there's a point where frumpy little dudes had a good time. So, get get that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of your mind. I'm sorry that women are going on Only Fans now and showing their butts for millions of dollars. The thing that you need to come back to as I as I before I get on any of these rants right here is it doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter if it's hard. There is nothing stopping you from being that 1% of man that gets all the things that everybody's talking about that they can't get anymore. There's nothing stopping you. Yes, 99 other dudes are having a bad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time. Why do you? There is nothing stopping you from making good amounts of money. There's nothing stopping you from getting a six-pack and being good-looking and taking care of yourself. I know the average view on this channel has a height of about 411, but other than that, I mean, you you there are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] girls out there for you. You'll be fine. You go into your little Hobbit gym, my little 4 foot1 followers, you can lift some weights, get jacked, you'll be fine. You still won't be able to reach the top shelf at the grocery store, but that's fine. You just don't just don't go to the grocery store with women. You got Whole Foods people to go shopping for you right now. They'll grab the top shelf for you. Just go hire some tall 6'7 Amazonian woman to go do your shopping. Heck, you could just go marry a tall Amazonian woman. She'll get all the top stuff. You won't even need to use those stools or ladders. Okay, I'm done with this rant. There's nothing stopping you from taking care of yourself when you're looking. There's nothing stopping you from being incredibly remarkably strong and not playing video games or smoking pot or drinking or watching pornography 24. There's nothing stopping you. And so what I see all these men doing out there is they watch all these videos and they're just like, "Well, I guess I'll just be an insult now. Like the world's so mean to me. It's so tough out there. All the women on the view keep saying I'm bad. I guess they'll justing ruin my life." Like that's what I'm seeing guys doing. And you just have to simply not submit. I don't care if it's hard. I don't care if most people are failing. Just don't be the one that fails. All it takes is it's not easy. It's not easy. But you just have to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] consistent. Pick where you want to go in life. Pick the things that you don't want to have problems with or you don't want to suffer from and then fix them. I'm going to give you some really good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] starting points right here. So look, as a man right here, there are things that are going to control your results in life more than anything else. It's your ability to make money. It's ability to control your health. It's your ability to be mentally strong and it's going to be your ability to probably interact with women. So, here's lesson number one on all these four things is you need to take the mind if you're a man right now. Every single one of these four things is adjustable. For some reason, I almost everyone I knew growing up, everyone I know now still believes this. Everybody, most men seem to believe that all these things are just set in stone. Like you either are born with the ability to make money, talk to women, be in shape, be decent looking, and handle your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Okay? They feel like your personality, everything's just ingrained into it. So, when I was growing up and I was in my 20s or whatever, no one I knew was trying to figure out how to make more money. No one I knew was trying to improve at talking to women. No one I knew that was trying to really improve their body shape or whatever. They're just like, "Oh, 22, this is basically what I look like." If you look at me in my 20s versus how I look now, no, you're not. It's not just basically what you look like. Every aspect of yourself outside your atrociously, atrocious shortness is completely augmentable. You can change all of it. And so the first thing you need to realize is you can just change all this just like a character in a video game. There's almost nothing you can't change, especially if you're still young. And so you have no excuse for just being like, hm, all right, so all I have to do is move these meters over here and then I'll be above the 99% of men and all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that they're dealing with that looks like a bad time. I mean, sitting in my house smoking pot, jerking off to dudes, pretending to be girls on only fans, that seems dark. I don't want to be there. So I'm going to adjust these meters right here. And then all you have to do is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it. So, here's where you start with any of these things. Let's talk about money. Are you going to be as rich as me? Well, look, I'm 37. It took me like 15 years, a long ass time to get to the large net worth I have now. That's really slow. I see so many 20-year-olds doing it so much faster. I I'm I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot. I'm really not that good compared to most 20-year-olds I seeing today. I'm seeing so many 20-year-olds building better, smarter, faster businesses than I did when I was 20. I mean, my first businesses, Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Batman. That was some dark [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] But I'm seeing kids putting together SAS businesses and getting to an $80 million valuation in their second week now. All right. So, are you going to get as rich as me? Maybe. I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You should give it a shot. I did it. But the thing you need to realize is even if you're not trying to get worth multiple nine figures or hundreds of millions of dollars. You can still learn valuable skills. You learn those valuable skills and then you sell them to businesses or you do them for businesses as a job. You can make tons of money as an employee. By the way, by the way, I have employees at my company who joined Hyros who started off as like the COO, for example. They worked their way up originally to CEO, then they got equity in my company. Uh there's people at my company right now that have almost an eight figureure net worth just from working for me. So, you can do it as an employee. You just have to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good at what you do. So, the first thing you need to think about when it comes to money is a I can get rich or make a lot of money at least compared to most people. And then realize the way to do that is you take your trade [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] seriously. I know this sounds like such basic advice, but there's so many people out there that don't look at their trade and say, "hm, what are the skill sets that go into being able to charge a lot for my job?" For example, Facebook just went and offered someone $100 million to come program their AI. What did that person do? He's an employee. He's getting paid hundreds of million dollars because he went and learned a valuable skill set that a business needs. So, what you want to learn if you're an employee or a person selling to businesses is what do businesses need? What do people who are making money need? And how can I create something that gives them value that makes them more money or saves them money? and then learn how to do that really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well. That's it. Like even if you're employee or you make a business, they're both the same thing. What do I do at high-risisk my software company? I looked at what businesses were doing running ads and I thought, how can we make them more money? How can we give them value? And then how can I build teams, build software, and do all those things? So, I figured out a bunch of things to do that, but it's all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] augmentable. And it started literally when I first got in the business, I said, what do businesses need? They need more customers. What's one way I could do that? SEO. There's a plethora of different ways. I followed that path. I use that to also land jobs doing SEOs for companies that I worked at. Just realize that you can poke the matrix back. That's the most important thing I got to say because when I was 20 years old, I thought, hm, I don't where the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] does money come from? Why do people make money? Why do people get paid a lot of their jobs? I didn't know. And I didn't think it was augment. I wasn't going to college or anything like that. So, I was like, ah, cuz I just can't make money. Nothing's further than the truth. You are completely in control of how much money you make. You just have to learn skills that make people money or give value to people and then master those. and work very very hard them just like playing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] World of Warcraft for 40 hours a day. If you approach it like that, you're going to win. Next, your health. How you look, everything that goes in that. And yes, your health applies to how you look. I'm not going to be talking so much about like personal health in terms of like your organs and how long you live. That's extremely important, but that's probably not bogging you down right now. I'm talking about your actual physical health. Look, if you're a dude outside of how short you are, there is nothing stopping you from understanding how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] food works, getting a basic skincare routine, making some money to fix your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] teeth. If you got jacked up, jaggled tooth, get some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] braces. Trust me, I know it sucks. My parents literally waited till the last year of high school to put me in braces. That was a fun last year. Fix your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] teeth. Learn some basic grooming. And then learn how to get a six-pack and put on muscles on your body. Learn how to eat protein and do these things. I wasn't necessarily good at any of these things when I first got started. I looked like a foot when I was in my 20s because I chronically drank and smoked pot and ate pizza for every single meal. There's nothing stopping you from learning these things. So, sit down and make a goal to absolutely learn how food works, what goes in your body and learn how to work out with aggression. I'm not saying you have to be some bodybuilder taking steroids or anything like that, but there is no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] reason you shouldn't have a six-pack. I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] What are you doing with your time? Why do you have to eat cupcakes or whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're doing that's stopping you from getting it? Why don't you Why don't you have some semblance of muscles? Why are you not lean? It's all controllable factors. These are all by your choice. Are the hot pockets and Chipotle burritos more important than what's going to control your results in life, which is your appearance. People are going to treat you differently. Women are going to treat you differently and you're going to feel better and feel more confident and you're not going to suck like 99% of men if you just go and handle this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right here. Finally, your mental well-being and fortitude. Stop trying to avoid hard things in life. That's the only thing you have to do. What you need to do at 20, you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who are living with your parents, like, what are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doing? The reason why so many men are suffering right now is because they're allowed to be little baby ass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] When I was 18 and I was barely past high school, my dad was like, "Well, I'll see you later." And I joined the military and I learned how to be a man after that. I learned how to handle my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and get together, which is what most men don't get the chance to do. They either go to college and their parents pay for it. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Or they stay in their parents house and like work from there and like don't go out and move out and like go see the world and stuff. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Or they sit around and they find some other reason tooodle around and not take on life's challenges. When you are 18 years old, you better have your suitcase [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] packed. Move out of your parents house, but it's expensive. Go bunk up with four other dudes who feel the same exact way. But I need to go to like college and have experience. No, you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] don't. Just go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] find go move to college town. I guarantee there's three, four dudes. They're all broke, too. And you could just go split a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] apartment or a few bedroom apartment. When I was in my 20s and I got out of the military, I just went and lived with buddies who were in college. And I had just a tiny little one-bedroom in this house, like this tiny little closet bedroom. And it was very, very cheap. Any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] can afford that. I was working as a bartender/barback and then eventually doing little side gigs online for SEO. I wasn't making a lot of money. So, what you need to do immediately if you're young, get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of your parents house and just go out there and just throw yourself in the world and live broke. It's fine. It's fine. And what's going to teach you is how to handle your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and grow. That's going to make you mentally strong. I'd also encourage you to go and start learning how to fight. One of my biggest regrets is not going and doing more Muay Thai or jiu-jitsu when I was younger. In fact, I did none of it cuz I was a giant baby back [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I only started doing tons of it when I got older. But that's just going to help you another layer of confidence and mental fortitude. and then go actively pursue learning and not putting up with your stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] emotions. Those emotions in your head and the things that's telling you to cry or think or feel an ego or some emotional response to all these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] videos telling you your life's over as a dude on internet. Just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ignore them and learn how to ignore them. Just get really good at ignoring those things. It doesn't matter. It's irrelevant. Those thoughts are not you. They have nothing to do with you. Like you can literally just sit here and watch your thoughts and all these stupiding things your brain produces. You can watch it like a television show. So that's obviously not you cuz you're watching it. So, not getting into that deep part right there, but master your damn mind and throw yourself into challenges. The reason why so many men are suffering is because they need to be challenged. You need to go and challenge yourself. When it comes to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] porn, video games, smoking, doing all stuff, just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop doing it. I don't know what to tell you. Like, you know this is going to make your life so much worse, yet you keep doing it. I know it's tough. I've had to get off marijuana at 1.2. Marijuana. I think that's how the the grown-ups say it now. I sound old, but I had to stop doing that stuff at one point, too. Yeah, you can't sleep for a little bit. It's annoying. And yeah, not drinking every weekend while your boys are at the bar getting drunk and you're at home working. Yeah, it's kind of hard. And not playing video games. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's kind of depressing not being able to play Fortnite with your boys. But guess what? You get to be rich and have everything else you ever wanted in life. So, it kind of pays off. Just don't do these things. I'm not going to make a whole video on stopping these things right now. I have a video on not drinking that I'll give you later in this video that applies all those things in video games and whatnot. Then finally, women. So many guys are down and out cuz women suck now. I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] care if every girl is becoming a porn star right now and is mean and wants to date a tall millionaire. Why don't you just go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be a tall Well, most of you guys can't do it. Why don't you just go be a jacked millionaire? I see all these videos like, "Oh, all the men think they want to all the women want to date just Chads now and they they see all these movie stars on Instagram and social media is a thing. bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chess who are mad that they have to compete in the genetic arena of dating and sex. I'm sorry that women's expectations are too high these days. And I'm sorry women are crazy. They've always been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. Like, thank you, internet, for discovering that women say all sorts of crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and do crazy things. And now dudes are like, "Well, girls are just either [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] these days or they want they want too high status of men, so I'm just going to sit in my house and be an incel." Okay, great. your competition if you're a dude is even lower than it was before when I had to go do it. Like back in the day, I had to go to bars and actually walk up to women and talk to them. But guess what? Guess what? Out of when I would go to bars or I go out to meet women, there'd be 100 other dudes at the bar. I was the only one walking up and approaching girls and like trying to get good at talking to them. So, the first thing I'm going to tell you is that one, your ability to interact with women is just like everything else I talked about. You could just improve that. Now, I don't think I'm the world's best game player out there, the best spitter of game. I'm no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Ryan Gosling, but you can get to the point where your interactions with most women are going to go pretty well. And then I see everybody complaining, oh, they want they want some millionaire with a six-pack. Why don't you just go be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] millionaire with a six-pack? Then all you have to do is just not eat potato chips, do crunches every single day, and then pick a craft and work on it and avoid video games, porn, and drinking, whatever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] other weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're doing. Like, you can do it. If if if that's your concern that women's bars are too high, yes, that sucks for the other 99% of dudes out there. It really does. You can't be some fat chad and expect to trick girls into dating you anymore. It sucks. I know. But for you, you don't have to be in that. You could just be the one the one that people pursue. Now, I'm not saying I'm the master of game or women or anything like that. I am telling you that if you focus on yourself and improving yourself, if you become mentally strong, you get yourself in shape, you make some money, you're going to be a top-of-the-line guy. And while I'm not saying every girl and their pack of sority sisters is going to want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you, you're going to probably have a pretty decent ratio. an experience with women and you're probably not going to hate all of them because the experience will usually be positive because you're actually providing value which is what everyone's looking for in a relationship. The women's seeking value, you're seeking value, too. Instead of saying, "Well, I suck ass. Why does no one want to date me? Cuz you suck ass." And the solution all this too and all this this Gooner stuff and incel stuff, just go work on yourself. And then when you've reached the point where you're a top tier dude, if you're still awkward around women, everything cuz God forbid I was just terrible at it, just go practice. Just go practice. Go out, walk up to a girl, talk to her. Going to go terrible. She's going to think you're there to collect her hair and sniff her or something, which you probably are. I know you guys watching this channel, but it's fine. She'll reject you. Then just go do it again. And just just go do it again. Just go do it again. And then go on dates.
