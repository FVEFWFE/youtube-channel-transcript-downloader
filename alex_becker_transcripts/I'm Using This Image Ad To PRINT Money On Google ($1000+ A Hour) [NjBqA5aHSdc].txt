================================================================================

all right you dorks I'm just joking you're not dorks you're really cool edgy guys look at you so look I got a lesson for you today bite size that is going to print money and by print money I mean this is something we recently started doing at my businesses and the ROI on these ads is higher than anything I've ever seen and combined with it here's the here's the fun point it's super duper cheap to run even if you're a complete beginner in business I think this is probably one of the first ad methods you should use because what it does is it allows you to gather a ton of people and build rapport with them so they already know you okay so it's not like they're some stranger and they're just getting hit with your face on the internet you get a big collection of people that know you and then you're able to advertise them super cheaply and in a way that no one else is doing this reaches people in much more Target way results in super cheap clicks and the ads are super cheap to run and they convert like absolute crazy so that's what I'm going to show you how to do in this video and if you're skeptical of all don't worry I'm already extremely rich I have no info courses or education or masterminds to sell you because using ad techniques i showing this channel I've built multiple eight figure businesses I built one nine figure business and I'm also the CEO of one of the largest ad tracking companies in the entire world which allows me to see what's working and paid advertising across billions and billions of dollars of AD spend so in short you could go to a lot worse places to getting your your ad info from I know the presentation on this channel is dumpster quality but trust me the info it's it's good it's going to work and talking about info let's talk about what we're going to talk about today so if you've seen my video on retargeting people that watch your YouTube videos I broke down how posting YouTube videos on the internet and then retargeting people that view those videos with YouTube ads is insanely effective and that is still true you should still watch that video and if you want to get tons of people to actually watch your YouTube videos and at high clickthrough rates I actually released last week my entire video that breaks down how I do my thumbnails which has got me massive success in other niches and if you look at this channel as far as paid advertising views go we get some of the highest views on YouTube and this channel like a month old so this really allows you to just that's looks like fisting it allows you to do inappropriate things it allows you to smack around your Niche very uh very well awkward but what I've recently D stumbled upon puts this on steroids so look there's a giant problem with YouTube ads right now and it really is specifically focused around B2B and in higher quality type of customers which most of you want I assume so the problem is everybody has YouTube Red that has any amount of money no one no one is not paying that 12 bucks a month to not skip YouTube ads I pay it everybody has it so you really get kind of cut off at the hip like 90% 70% I don't know the exact percentage of people you want to Market to are going to not be seeing ads on YouTube which is a big problem if you want to retarget people to watch your YouTube videos but I found a really nasty workaround that I have been using to just drain money from you guys watching the I'm just kidding but not really to just absolutely Bank off off these videos I'm making here on YouTube and don't worry I'm not going to be selling you something you're going to see an ad for me here pretty soon but it's going to be something that's going to make you more money because if you just apply the lessons and AD tactics I give you on this channel and then track your ads with hyos you are literally guaranteed or you do not pay for it going to see a huge increase in your ads because lo and behold tracking your ads and not running them like a drunk pirate allows you to run your ads more efficiently and get more of your customers so that's what I'll be selling you in the future but I'm just going to help you right now there's no catch but this has been working for crazy like me on this channel the few other businesses I've shared this with no one's really doing this I don't know why it worked like crazy for them and what it involves is using the ad Network that nobody ever uses which is the Google Display Network no one ever uses this thing so last video I talked about how to create really high converting image ads and that video is linked below here I have no paid content it's all for free on YouTube and that's going to show you the same exact techniques I use to create images for gdm what we're going to focus on here is just simply the application and understanding this method so let me show you how this works first in my terrible whiteboard of Justice all right so here's how this works it's really simple one you want to use my techniques that I shared with you last video to get tons of views on YouTube okay I've broken down an entire video talking about how I make my videos how I make people watch them how I get really high watch time that is linked below and then also how I get really high click-through rates and make my thumbnails get lots of clicks that's linked below so if you want to get views on YouTube that is all there and trust me you don't have to be entertaining you just have to speak in patterns and sales patterns like I do in these videos to make you watch dogit quality content for lots of times to boost I'm just kidding the content here is good but the way I speak in these videos and the way I do all my videos even my videos in crypto and everything it's all following sales patterns and hooking patterns to get people's watch time as high as possible so watch those you could just not run ads at all and just be a degenerate who only tries to sell through free traffic um and that works totally fine and you could just use that method but this right here is much better so you're going to use those methods to get a lot of views on YouTube again link below in the description totally free on YouTube now what we want to do is again I told you the big issue I'm seeing is specifically when I'm targeting you guys on YouTube um when you watch these videos is most of you guys at least the ones that aren't poor which is the ones I need to get on the hyos nobody's spending $10,000 a month on ads uh that is that is out of money but everybody has YouTube Red so no one's seeing your ads that has any bit of money to their name so what we're we want to do instead is I discovered that look you can block my ads all day on YouTube but unless you're one of those dorks who's using an ad blocker um you can't block it on gdn and so what I've been doing is just running tons of gdn ads and this has just been getting us the cheapest calls and the highest conversions at hyos in in other business I've shared this wor it's working like crazy so let me kind of show you how this works okay so we're inside the account right now and I want to take you inside this campaign right here which is one of the ones and I have a few different Google ads accounts this is just one it's not all the ads that we're running but this is one of the ones right here that's targeting people that view our YouTube ads and you can see the cost per lead right here is just astoundingly low the cost per call the people coming in it's a joke um you can see this like here's standard retargeting of people that come to our website so these are all the people that come to hyos here's all the people that just view a YouTube video one of these ad videos so you see we're just getting crazy low okay you can see even when we're like running normal YouTube ads it's like $200 per call I'm getting them for 1/4 that right here now if we go and look at this one thing I want to point out to you very quickly is if you look at the amount of conversions that Google caught right here it caught 11 conversions when I actually had 33 so look I'm not going to sit here and Shi hyros to these this entire video I don't think I have to when you're seeing this stuff in your ad manager and I mean you're going to see the same exact thing in Facebook you can see the amount of leads we caught 49 to the 10 that Facebook caught right here look if you're running ads in anything and you're using Google and Facebook ad tracking metrics you're not getting your conversions in you're not seeing all your customers if you're working off of bad data if I was using this data right here I wouldn't have the results to report to you I wouldn't know to scale AKA I'd be running ads like a drunken baboon uh if you actually track where your sales are coming from and then optimize for those sales coming in you're going to make a ton more money so by all means please use this method and then when it makes you some money make it make you more money by actually tracking it correctly and seeing your results so you can optimize around your results I don't even have to pitch it just you could just compare the tracking and then ask yourself how am I going to get results when I can't see what's getting results how can I optimize for it so Nob brainer anyways if we go into these ads right here I'm going to show you some of the ads that I'm running so first and foremost all I'm doing right here is I'm just going into the audiences and you can set up basic audiences in your shared Library okay so I'm sure anybody that knows how to build audiences you you know how these work but you can just go to YouTube users okay I can name this something that is memorable to me like poo poo fart poop okay that's very memorable I will we'll have that in the back of our head forever and then what we're going to do is we just select our channel uh I can do any of my channels right here we're just going to do business roids and viewed any video in the past 30 days 540 days and what I like to do is I create two audiences one that's just 540 days and then one that's 30 days of course the 30 days is going to be better a 3-day one is going to be better if you're trying to be as cheap as possible do it on the lowest time frame possible obviously the cost uh per lead is going to go up as the days increase so I would have three audiences 3 days 30 days 540 days the three days is going to get you the best results but it's going to be the smallest audience so that's how that works so then what we're going to do once we have that set up is we're just going to go and run ads to these people it's that simple so you can see I have two ads right here what I like to do is primarily uh I showed you my image ads with like the text and everything and then I'll I'll actually be breaking down another group of image ads later this week that is just killing it for us so again subscribe to the channel uh stay tuned but you can see right here what I'm going to try and do specifically for retarding ads is is if you put your face in videos you can see these are also just trash ads like I can make much better images for this but if we go look at these images right here so here's an example image right here and what's kind of funny is this is obviously set for Black Friday I just was been I've just been super lazy testing this and so you can just see like I just have this like promo image up right here so what's the lesson to take away from this right here one put your face in the image if people see your face in videos that's what people are going to recognize okay and then I just like to usually use something that's triggered by scarcity because if you remember last video when we were talking about image ads we're not primarily trying to introduce the brand to them or uh create a cold ad right here the person if they are watching your YouTube videos and you've already introduced what your product is so for example in these videos I'm not like hard selling you hros or anything like that what I'm doing is I'm teaching you and getting you results and then suggesting you get better results by using our phenomenal product but I'm not like buy hyros now buy hros now hyros is great and doing a hyos sales demo right now so when you guys see this ad in the future you're going to see my face you're going to recognize me because you've watched me in the videos probably recently and then I'm going to have something like I'll never do this again and soon and I'm giving you a reason to act on the things I talked about in this video so there's a prep sale or whatever going on on and so that's going to give you a reason to click that ad on gdn of course you could just run run-of-the-mill cold ads um like our other ads that we have right here okay I showed these ones to you last video this one has worked really really well for us but that's not going to be as effective to you right now because you're going to see you don't know what my product looks like you don't know what hos primarily looks like right here and um and while this ad would be effective because you are interested in ads I'm running it to having an ad where my face is in it and you direct ly recognize me from the channel um is going to be super way more effective and what this is also really good for is because this Builds an email list for me another ad type that we've seen has worked very well for this it's even easier to run is going to be the Gmail ads and any other type of AD you can run on the Google Network that is not YouTube again the primary issue with YouTube is one everybody's using YouTube so it's very expensive and two uh anybody that has any amount of money is using uh has YouTube premium which is really bad for it but this allows us to just go and build a giant email list of people and I can hit you whenever I release a special or anything like that I can hit every single person to watch my YouTube videos with these gdn ads I can hit you in your email inbox with these ads and because you've watch these you're familiar with me and you recognize my face it's extremely effective so I don't think there's much more to add to the strategy other than this as I just showed you from our direct results we're just getting leads and calls so much cheaper doing this and uh it's cheap than running YouTube reting ads and is even getting better results than people that have visited our website so what you should do my suggestion is you is one use the blueprint I have for YouTube videos that's linked on this channel to get long watch times on that side of the algorithm then use the other video below to learn how to get high click-through rates and good click-through rates on your thumbnails and headlines combine those together you get lots of people viewing your YouTube channel and whatever Niche you're in you don't need a lot of people so for example on these videos I'm getting like 5 10,000 views on average that's not a lot of views in terms of YouTube and ads ad content is like the worst lowest viewed content on YouTube it's very hard to break 10,000 views of video it's just there's not too many people running ads which is fine because those 10,000 people if I get 20 30 customers at highis per video we're doing phenomenally well the average value per customer is like $3,000 to $10,000 per year so we're making hundreds of thousands of dollars per video just using this simple little tactic right here so in your Niche if you're doing like makeup or Cosmetics or protein powder and you're like the workout Niche or any other bigger Niche like that you get way more views using the methods I talked about here use this exact tactic right here no one's using gdn correctly these days it's like the most ignored ad Network that actually works and then it works so that all being said everything you need the supplemental content I mentioned is below this video I'm releasing videos about twice a week on this channel one time a week give or take subscribe because the tell you just straight up works I'm using stuff that's just going on in our ad accounts right now on on top of that we end these videos in the most awkward way possible so you can look forward to
