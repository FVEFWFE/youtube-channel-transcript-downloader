irelians it is alex becker ceo of uh you know that high roast company i think it makes everybody's ads run better but that's not important what is important is i'm going to give you an ad script that i've used in my business that hundreds of businesses who i've helped to views that just absolutely crushes on facebook it gets people to pay attention better it gets them to watch the entire video and more importantly whatever you're trying to get them to do after the click it gets them to do it at a much higher rate while dropping for example your cost per lead or your cost per sale immensely i'm not telling you this just because i think it's cool i've seen this every single time in my business i've seen across all the businesses that i've worked with and i think you should know it too because my goal ceo of pyros is when you watch these videos you use this information to grow your ad account which then makes you buy a higher level of tracking account at hiros so you can increase the roi of your ads using our ai optimization like everybody else so it benefits me when you do better from your ads so i'm just going to tell you how to do it and tell you what i see in the industry that being said let's just get into it and by the way as you watch this video i'm going to tell you everything i know about this but if you actually want help with your ads or getting on the youtube book a call with me below my team and i have coached literally hundreds of businesses to their first six figures seven figures and a few eight figures so it's useful but this is gonna be useful too so pay attention to this first okay guys so what we're looking at right here is by far my best performing ad in our arsenal right now i wanna stress that i have many different ads in the ad set but they all follow this script and template they all follow this format so what you're gonna see here applies almost every single ad i run specifically the cold traffic for retargeting i might have a little bit different of a script you can actually see a huge video on my retargeting strategy below in the description it'll be just pop out to see more it'll be there as well on top of that if you're interested in doing this on youtube as well i have a full script for how i run my youtube ads which is where i'm a little bit more lethal than facebook again that's in the description i just released tons of cool content on here constantly if you enjoy that please just leave a like hit the notification bell and subscribe that's going to make sure that you see whenever we release this content every monday wednesday and friday the stuff i'm releasing on this channel is better than anything you'll get in a paid course so this ad right here crushes and i want to break down every little part of this because it's a big cake there's the icing there's the strawberries and they all tie together okay if i stuck mangoes on top of this cake it wouldn't work so every little thing ties together so the first thing you need to always do when you're making a facebook ad is you need to understand that most people are going to view your ad on mobile what it looks like on desktop is where you're going to be building it at but it's very different okay you can see there's more text that's shown you can see the full entire headline right here is shown and frankly you can already see a few little problems with this on mobile you can see the headline doesn't quite finish okay but really that's important right here is this big headline right here you have to understand that there's two steps to your ad there's what catches people's attention and then there's what they actually are going to read once you have their attention so first thing in the description right here you need to make sure that before this see more button right here you have a big huge benefit and then you have a pre a setup right here this here how here's how sets them up to say okay i want to see the rest of us so let's skip the fluff pyro slowers add cost by as much as 52 while increasing add roi period here's how so that right there is a really big hook and they can get them to click to see more button i'll get into everything that's after the seymour but really this is the least important part of that no one's going to really read this the next most important thing right here is that when you have your ad video and videos just usually do better there's times when images will do better but what i've seen in all my testing is videos do better but you need to understand that the first frame of your video or you can set the thumbnail is going to be what people see and you can see what i have right here i have this little thumb drive in the center right there why am i doing that is hyrus stored on the thumb drive no it's not at all but people want to know what the heck this is if you ever see some of the best ads out there it's a person holding a weird object or something it starts at a loop in the person's head that they have to finish they have to figure what is this thing and what relevance is there to it okay if it's just you sitting somewhere or on a laptop the intrigue isn't created at the same effect now what i love to do is this first headline right here needs to be a massive challenge our tracking ai will scale your ads or you don't pay now let me explain kind of what i'm doing right here because there's so many things going on with this headline first off you will make more money or you don't pay is just such a bold statement it's like it's like i walked up and and slapped a hundred thousand dollars on the table in vegas and said the the packers are gonna win the super bowl you're gonna wanna you're gonna wanna know why i believe so strongly and what i just said if i just say something like our tracking will scale your ads you're like okay sure if i say our tracking will scale our ads or i'll give you money or it's free you're like okay this guy couldn't make this statement if it wasn't true because then you want to make money that's what i like to do right here can you make that in every business no but i like to make businesses where i can guarantee results because it's just so much easier to sell something when you know it's going to get a personal results can you imagine like selling a refrigerator that only turns on 80 of the time and how stressful that'd be no i just want to sell a refrigerator that turns on every time person gives me money they get cold food that's what i like to sell okay this refrigerator will cool your food or it's free which is actually how businesses should be run if your product doesn't get results it should be free anyways i'm not going to get into that that's just a really good asset for selling now there's one other thing i'm doing right here ai will scale your ads so hiros does plug in the facebook and google ais and it sends correct data to them and it makes the ai targeting much more effective people that plug the ai in see lower cost per acquisition that's just how it is if you're interested in getting that you should book a call below it's in the description i don't know why you'd run ads without it but what i'm also doing right here is i love focusing on the ai aspect of hi-ros when there's really two parts of the house there's a really advanced tracking that allows you to see everything and make great decisions but then there's the feeding in the ai the reason why i focus on the ai aspect right here is because people are very interested in ai just the general concept of it it's mysterious it's sexy people don't know what it is it's it's provocative the reason why i want to use something that's provocative is because it's provocative it catches a person's attention and creates mystery that they want to figure out what is what ai is he referring to and how is it going to scale my ads if i just said our tracking will help you make better decisions people instantly get it you want the headline to offer a big benefit a massive guarantee or a bet and then create mystery with how it's going to do it because then people want to know how it's going to do it and why you're so confident in it that's why i use ai so much in our ads yes it is a big part of hirose but it's also the most mysterious part i want to use mystery okay now i have right here take the hi-ros challenge your ad scale or it's free you can see on desktop you can see this clearly i frankly this ad already needs to be improved a little bit but you're going to see in my headlines right here i always have a message like this i love take the hi-ros challenge because it's like hey we'll bet on our software we'll bet on our product or it's free you will make more money or it's free that is just such a big bold bet that is a hundred thousand bet on the packers running winning the super bowl and you want to be like all right why is this guy so confident so at this point in time i really have the person's attention and they're going to do two things they're going to click see more or they're just going to watch the video usually what they're going to do is they're going to watch the video okay i'm going to get into the copy of the text here in a second but the video is just so much more important and if you understand how the video works you also understand how to write the text okay so let's get into this video real quick let's go five seconds at a time so what five to ten seconds at a time if you run ads this ai tracking script will scale your ads at least 20 further and get you customers as much as 52 cheaper i guarantee it no literally guarantee this is called hirose and if it doesn't get you those results you don't pay for it and that's okay so what did i just do there i called out exactly what people want you have to understand that i don't want to sell people ai ai is the story behind the benefit they're going to get so what do i mean by the story they're going to get what people want is more money from their ads but people want is the result more dates more money from their business a faster computer processor to learn code quickly they want a result okay now what i do it there is i tell them they're going to get the result through a mysterious way that they are also very interested in it's hard to describe what i'm i'm using this for but whenever you're thinking about anything you're going to sell you want the benefit and the story behind how they're going to get the benefit to be a new opportunity because if people believe it's an opportunity they've already seen they're going to mix it out that is the most important thing when you're running any business via ads it has to appear like a new opportunity now it's even better if you actually have a new opportunity the combination of ai and tracking at hieros is something that literally no other business has they just don't there's a few other people that have ways to send in data like we do but nobody has all the assets we do especially with the facebook api it is a new opportunity but even if you're not selling a truly new opportunity what you want to do is you want to present it as a new opportunity for example if you were selling like a shopify course or something like that you don't want to present it as how to make money with shopify you want to present it by finding a loophole between chinese imports that 711's been abusing for years that you can now use to get into the same hyper profitable loophole that they've been abusing okay if it's dating it has to be something like you know i discovered an algorithm i saw this dating the other day i discovered an algorithm in tinder which gets me five thousand percent more dates people don't understand the algorithm they don't know what it is but it's a new opportunity okay but the benefit is more dates the benefit is more roi from your ads now what i also do right here is i also make that big big big guarantee okay so not only do i bet super hard on it which raises a level of intrigue but i also then show all the businesses that also back up this bet now it's not they're like directly backing it up and saying we swear on this but they use the systems and so i show big brands that people know about in testimonials and that's why big brands like clickfunnels.com tomballsimpacttheory.com b graziosi and tonyrom's mastermind.com six seven eight and nine figure e-commerce brands like ladyboss.com massive influencers with millions of followers sales and ad leaders like dan henry and even one of the highest revenue click funnels funnels of all time outsmarting gymlodge.com they all use this too so what i just do there it's so important when you start a business when it comes to ads to recognize who your target customer is going to be and then figuring out who they look up to if you can get those people then in your these people are going to flock on your business like crazy this is the i think one of the best sales tactics ever so how do you do this well the best way to actually do that is when you're designing your business think of something that the businesses actually need it's a new opportunity okay if i was selling another mailchimp like for example when i ran market hero which is an email software none of these big brands would have came on not a single one because i already have an email autoresponder none of these big brands really had a good tracking or ai optimization solution so i designed it for them i got them on first i got them results and in return i asked for a testimonial or at least to be able to use them as examples so what did i just do i made a huge benefit i created a story around it people still aren't really sure how i get the results here and i'm going to keep it that way intentionally because the point of an ad is not to explain everything it's to get a person to click and then go to the sales copy where you then convert them it's so important you understand with ads i see people explaining everything in their ads the point of the ad is to get the click to the page that is going to convert the person so again you notice i made a big benefit i kept it mysterious i guaranteed it i put a hundred thousand dollars on the table for the packers then i showed big businesses that these people look up to doing it and so people at this point are like okay i don't know what this is but it's provocative i want to know what's going on here how is this going to work because obviously this guy's guaranteeing it he couldn't make these statements if he couldn't make money from this if it wasn't working and then all these people i know are using it what's going on here and so do hundreds of other businesses and frankly if you're not using it too you're at a massive disadvantage because frankly you're paying way too much to get a customer because when you use print tracking plus ai optimization you pay much less you can alright so next thing you need to understand what just happened here i'm going i'm going for fomo all right fomo is the best way to get people to click ads okay fomo's the entire reason people are dumping their life savings in bitcoin right now they're afraid of missing out fomo fear of missing out is is so extremely powerful that it can destroy you when you're investing it can destroy you in so many aspects of your life or it can get you to click an ad so what i do right here i made the benefit i created a mysterious story i made a big old bet and then i backed the bed up with reputable uh with basically authority authority and now what i'm doing is basically saying okay so here's all these things that i guarantee and you're behind the curve you're missing out and so first off i then tap into fomo and then i increase the fomo by identifying it around specific pains okay for example you're going to spend 100 000 on ads this year and 15 000 of that is going to be wasted you could just keep that instead and make the same amount okay this right here showing everybody else getting in on something that's a that is the powerful thing that is the thing that gets the click everybody else is getting in on bitcoin except for you oop that's that's that's literally why people are buying bitcoin at thirty eight thousand dollars instead of five thousand dollars that's literally why everybody's getting rich except for you everybody's getting in on this new opportunity except for you that is the most powerful driving thing to get a click on an ad ever and usually to get sales if it's actually true then what we do is we attach the fomo to real life pain you can scale much further you get customers cheaper you can bid more competitively and if you click this ad i'll explain in extreme detail how it all works and we will even set this up for you and we will also guarantee the results i've talked about all right so what do i do at this point wrapping it all up fomo massive pain if you want to know how to get out of this pain you want to know how to get on and what everybody else is doing and you want to know exactly how this is and how it works don't worry i'll explain it all to you if you click what i am selling in an ad what i am selling in an ad is not my product i am not selling hirose in this ad at all i am selling a click i am asking a person to pay with a click that's what you're selling in an ad that's what you must and so this is the sales process to get someone to do very very very very little for you okay a click is a micro commitment and so we're doing is we're using pain fomo and mystery and the chance that massive benefit and massive mystery that's also amped up by a massive bet to get a person to do one simple thing i don't know if you can hear my mouse right now but i'm clicking just move their finger and this right here is why this is so damn powerful so i also want to stress one thing right here the stuff that's on the c-more i don't think is really that important i literally copy and paste everything i have seen more on every single ad okay and you're going to see me using almost the same exact process that i use right here okay the most important thing let's skip the fluff it's it's this this headline right here all right i first make everything in a way that is going to be easily readable quickly on a mobile ad make your thumbnail intriguing if you run out this a what is this thing big bet headline using a benefit mystery and huge bet second headline big bet emphasized take the high rose challenge your ad scale or you or you don't pay all right i might just want to say your ad scale or you don't and or you don't pay that would be a better way to present this headline script present massive benefit via a new opportunity place a massive bet on it guaranteeing it okay that makes it so hey this guy must be saying it's true if i didn't place a massive bet on like i said like dude your business is gonna make a hundred thousand dollars if you just listen to me okay this guy probably full of it like every other internet marketer no no if you don't make a hundred thousand dollars you don't pay me okay this guy must be he must be delivering this or he wouldn't make any money okay that's what we do at hiros back it up with authority and rapport with people they already have rapport with then make them feel fomo about missing out on this new opportunity emphasize all the problems it's going to cause in their life the longer they wait urge them to click this is how you get clicks on facebook this is how you get super cheap clicks on facebook this is how you get people to do things on facebook that is it bonus tip if you're running ads on facebook what you need to know to actually understand which ads are going to generate you the best roi is you also need to have accurate data check this out right here if i go and look at my ad manager stats right here on facebook you can see it said i had three calls but it doesn't even tell me what my roi was on this all right this ad set right here generated me seventy two hundred dollars at a hundred fifty seven dollars per call okay that's an insane roi if i was using the basic facebook stats for example the three calls i would have stopped this the calls were super expensive at 261 and i wouldn't even know it maybe an roi here's another one right here 10 calls that i actually achieved okay facebook is reporting a much higher one only caught eight more importantly if we go look at some of these ones facebook will also go and over report sometimes okay the facebook tracking is great for what it is one size fits all plugins slow it on no no support needed kind of thing but if you actually want real stats you want to go off for real stats you should go book a call below with hiros because it's going to help you identify which ads you have actually are working and then more importantly generating sales not just getting clicks
