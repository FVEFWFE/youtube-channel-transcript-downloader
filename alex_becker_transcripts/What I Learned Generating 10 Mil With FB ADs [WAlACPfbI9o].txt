================================================================================

in my career i've generated tens of millions of dollars strictly just from facebook ads alone now look i don't want to toot my horn but most of the things people do on facebook ads are counter intuitive counterproductive to actually going and making your ads scale the things i see every single day looking at accounts at highrost which is the fastest growing ad tracking company in the world so i have a little bit insight in what's working and what's not and what i see is a lot of people are doing things that really limit their accounts and if you do what i show you in this video i can almost nearly guarantee you're going to see a 20 to 50 increase in your ads because frankly these things are not that simple it's not like you have to go and rework the entire system and then get albert einstein and elon musk and have them make a baby and then have them come optimize your system without you really just have to go and understand what is going to make facebook move forward and what's going to make it move backwards i'm also sorry about making you picture the baby of elon musk and albert einstein in your head i apologize so that being said that's what we're gonna get into you should also subscribe this channel because i alex becker have nearly a decade's worth of experience over 30 million dollars in sales and advertising alone and i also am the ceo of the fastest-growing ad tracking company in the world iros which gives me even more cool insights so you subscribe because i'm just going to tell you everything i know and everything i see because if you're at scale you're probably going to need to get better attribution which you can get through highros which is guaranteed to increase the roi in your ads by 15 20 or you don't pay no seriously you should check it out after this video but let's get into this okay guys so we're at the white board of truth and justice if you want to know why it's called that it's because there's a lot of truth and justice going on here so if you're an evildoer who lies a lot you should probably you should probably back away from this video it might make your skin burn so look i'm just going to start with the top five things you need to be doing on facebook if you just do these five things you're gonna have a good time so let's just start from the top the number one thing i can tell you about facebook ads or any ads in general but super duper facebook ads just go high ticket what does this mean so what high ticket means is you want to be highly priced for your industry so for example if you're like in the fitness industry 297 to a thousand dollars is high ticket if you're in the b2b uh software industry ten thousand dollars would be high ticket if you're in the info industry or you're selling information courses five thousand dollars would be high ticket you got to really look at your industry overall and see what the higher end products being sold are the ones that are more expensive you don't really have to rack your brain on this i can guarantee there's high ticket products being sold in your face and the deeper you can get towards the high-end spectrum the better now what i mean by high-end is don't just make take your product and be like now it's five thousand dollars i was selling it for a hundred dollars yesterday that means look at the products selling for five thousand dollars in your space the most expensive things selling so for example in sas i'm in sas you can look at something like segment when it originally came out they were selling i think for like ten thousand dollars up front or they sell large business packages if you look at hubspot back in the day the way they really made their ads work really well is they start charging a year up front that's high ticket they found a way to make their product high ticket if you look at some info products out there in info coaching instead of selling a 47 product people sell a more exclusive mastermind for i don't know ten thousand dollars this is what i'm referring to right here and you might even be wondering how can i do this in something like the supplement space it's quite easy you just find a way to package all your products together into a larger upfront sale and you can actually just go out there and actually slap some info marketing or a course on top of it to increase the value even more so for example i believe dr axe was selling all the supplements all together with like a uh gut healing course at the same time for 199 to 297 which is pretty high ticket in the supplement space i've seen people do this all the way up to like 497. why do you want to bend over backwards to do this it's very simple your goal with ads and the best way to make your ads hyper profitable like insanely profitable is to make your goal of your ads to acquire customers at a profit what does this mean so most people's goal of their ads is just to make profit this is bad because it actually slows your business down a whole lot you want to acquire customers first as your main goal while making a profit or breaking even but when you go high ticket you can have the best of both worlds why is this so important why is it so important so the hardest part of a business is getting not sales from ads it is going and getting enough customers in your brand to consistently not need ads if you can make a brand where you have a customer base that repeatably buys you are going to be comically wealthy that is the number one main thing now how can we best acquire customers how can we scale up so we acquire customers as easily as possible easy the ads have to be profitable if you have a if you have an ad for every thousand dollars you spend you make two thousand dollars back while acquiring let's say 100 customers at 10 each you could scale that ad all the way to 20 000 a day in theory and be capturing excuse me if i mess up my math any point in this video 2 000 new customers a day who can then come and spend let's say if each of them spends with you over the rest of the year an additional twenty dollars well you're pumping out forty thousand dollars a day in additional revenue on top of let's say i don't know forty thousand dollars a day of actual revenue coming in at a twenty thousand dollar hard cost this is juicy even if we remove this right here this is juicy see the problem with ads it's really hard where most people get caught up is it's really hard to convert people from cold traffic you're you're going to have some people they're going to buy but most people are not going to buy so the key here is just look at this simple metric right here let's say we have a thousand people come through a funnel and we have a 99 product okay if we have only 10 of people buy this product right here which is the most insane conversion rate ever you're not going to have 10 of people come from a cold funnel and buy ever especially at 99 let's imagine this is an insane super crazy world it's the best funnel ever you're going to make 10 000 for that thousand people that came in but let's imagine to get those thousand people to come in you're paying ten dollars per person which is very reasonable okay very reasonable so let's imagine you run this it costs you ten dollars per lead you get a thousand people in ten percent of those people buy at 99 okay cool so we get 100 sales at 100 bucks got 10 000 bucks whoo awesome that sounds pretty good right except we just literally broke even even with the world's greatest converting funnel so let's imagine we we switch this up a little bit we keep the same exact numbers but we get a thousand people in and we get one percent of them to buy a two thousand dollar product just one percent not great conversion rates okay we get one percent of them buy a two thousand dollar product well we just made twenty thousand dollars in sales and we get one percent of them to buy a two thousand dollar product well we just made uh twenty thousand dollars in sales i'm sorry i'm drawing this very badly but there you go you know one percent of people in the funnel that's ten two thousand dollar we doubled our money while getting the same thousand people into the business that's just why it works and i'm gonna tell you it's way easier to do this than it is to do this because there's gonna be a certain amount of people that come into your funnel that are just really targeted customers and really want to buy so let's say we're selling information on how to improve your businesses facebook ads okay and we could sell a 99 course or we could just go a little bit higher ticket and make a more exclusive uh master course for two thousand dollars it's gonna be impossible to do this it's gonna be extremely easy to do this the same concept applies in almost every niche any niche i've ever seen going high ticket with your ads is a better way then you can sell anything else you want because you have this thousand people in your business that are now targeted customers they know who your brand is they know what you're all about they can buy your other products but more importantly we got these thousand people in for free while making a ten thousand dollar profit that's the big coconut right here and then we can make we can retarget these people right here we can market to them more we can put them on an email list we can do all sorts of things to them and it's going to do this i stress to you i very rarely see businesses crush it with this and i see businesses crush it non-stop doing this so the next lesson i have for you is keep your ads simple and basic when i see people running facebook ads i see all these ones with dramatic videos they have like these cameras flying around and they have all these things going on and the first thing you need to understand when it comes to ads is the most important thing you can ever do with ads is be able to get fast feedback loops because a lot of times even if you go and make the world's best shot ad it's probably not going to work okay most ads fail so investing tons of time in an ad or investing tons of effort into an ad instead of going and getting ads out quickly is actually going to just ruin your chances of having effective ads it's way better to make almost sloppy or simple to make ads that you can quickly put out there and get an answer back very quickly so you can find the answer and message that works because what gets people to buy on facebook and what gets people to go through your ads on facebook is the message and that's really it people want to people are going to react to certain wordings of your proc certain benefits and certain angles and your main goal as a person run ads is to find out that message so let me explain it like this when i started up hi-ros a lot of people think well i just need to make better shot ads or more in-depth ads or talk more in ads no no no no no at hirers i started off with three messages okay i started off with three different messages let's just say folk let's say i'm running a b2b ad in general okay let's say i'm running a b2b ad for roofers first ad focuses on saving money for roofers next one's focuses on making more money the next one focuses on using a special optimization to get them more customers a cheat list or something like that let's say a cheat list okay when i was running a house i had four or five different messages i tested i used the same filming setup the same simple simple videos i'll show you here in a second this message didn't work this message didn't work this message went it's insane okay out of the five messages i used one of them went absolutely nuts and my ad costs plummeted my ab results skyrocketed the ad results did not come from me filming a better video in fact if i'd spent tons of time making in-depth videos and i just committed to those ones i wanted to be able to get that feedback loop fast enough to find out the message in my business that was actually converting people the way i made ads that worked really well was simply by making simple ads that i could produce rapidly that's the most important thing you can see right here look at this ad right here this ad performs super well performed super well let's skip the fluff let's skip the fluff however lowers add costs by as much as 52 while increasing roi period here's how i'm not going to read the rest of it because all there is is a picture of me saying are tracking ai skills your ads are you don't pay this ad right here crushes it it is simply a picture of me taken last year with some simple text and a picture of elon musk with his with ai stamped on his head that took me literally 15 seconds to make and then the headline right here new ai gets customers cheaper learn more okay i took this ad right here is actually very complicated because it took many iterations and micro changes to do but overall to produce the overall ad and then get feedback on those micro changes and optimization took seconds feedback loops are how you improve ads quickly not by going and making complicated ads i guarantee if we just go through my facebook news feed right now extremely well-shot well-filmed ads like this going through look we can talk about all day if there's some benefit to this and i'm sure having slightly more professional ads works really well but this this looks like a tv commercial right here and this doesn't even have subtitles but i guarantee right here it took them so long to make this video right here like there had to be multiple people involved in this we had to get this good crazy camera set up right here all the photography all this stuff going on we don't even know if this is the ad message that works the best we don't even know if this is what converts people we don't even know if what's being said in the video is something that hooks people we got to find that hook and then if you're going to make these complicated videos you're going to make more complicated more professional ads get your message first split test ugly simple ads they'll come kingdom comes find the one that gets you to absolute lowest lowest conversion rates or lowest cost of acquisition rates and then make the professional video i can almost guarantee you that the professional video will do worse i've had powerpoint presentation ads destroy well-shot will optimize well beautiful ads that i've made okay so take that to heart next thing with your ads this is where everybody dies in facebook this is where literally every single person dies in facebook there's two markets you can only get into all right so let's say you're in the space for teaching real estate agents to get more clients there's only two markets you can focus on that will work and allow you to scale let's say we're in real estate teaching people to get more clients you can either focus on people who are absolute beginners aka they've never even thought of making real estate uh their their business they've never thought of getting in the real estate and actually becoming a real estate agent okay or you sell the people that are already making let's say 50 000 a year from real estate what most people do in facebook is they try to market to both these audiences at once this is the biggest single mistake on facebook ads everyone does this and then they can't get on the youtube ads because youtube ads punishes this 10 times when facebook does see what facebook does when you first get into is most people try to market to both at once so they're gonna make a course that can help beginners start their first real estate business but also is designed for existing real estate agents who are already making money this works on facebook to a certain extent because at low scale you can really target both these people right here and the market and the targeting on facebook is forgiving enough to let you get away from this but the second you start to say scale what happens is you go into a broader market and you start advertising to more people in facebook's optimization is just not nearly as good at this level all right and it doesn't matter there isn't enough people in this this targeting bubble for it to work even if it had the best optimization okay there just isn't enough people for you to go this this far out in scaling for it to bring you enough customers to scale with so what you have to do is you have to make sure you advertise to only one of the spectrum so you can maximize who you're advertising to you can't advertise the two people at once they're in completely different positions it doesn't work and so people do is they do this and they keep trying to scale out and then their ads keep dying this is why ninety percent of people's ads die and they can't scale on facebook and this is why e-commerce businesses have such an easier time scaling on facebook because they never try to market really outside their niche if they're selling something if they're selling a supplement that helps people lower their cholesterol they're only selling to those people that's it maybe men uh 40 to 60 they pick their demographic and they just go in on it the thing with almost every other niche people don't pick a demographic and go in on it if you pick a demographic and go in on it you're going to dominate it and you're actually going to see better rois at low and you might not even have to scale so for example at hiros i only need to spend two thousand three thousand dollars a day to [Music] generate tens tens and tens and tens of thousands of dollars a day i'm not going to get into the exact metrics but it's a lot all right so either make a product for existing real estate agents making money and in your ads do not focus on beginners you can even say this is not for beginners this is for real estate agents making only 50 000 plus a year or say this is for absolute beginners this is for absolute beginners you this is this is the easiest way to make money ever this is a great way to make money you don't even mention real estate in the ad why do you do this because beginners are going to be repulsed by a course that is too in-depth and too focused on real estate up front they're going they're looking for a way to make money quickly they're looking for a way to get started without effort okay so they're going to gravitate towards something that's super beginner oriented and start for someone who's just looking to start their first business ever that's what they're going to gravitate to they're not going to want to buy a course that's even sort of made for a real estate agent can be like i'm not in real estate i have all these pre-existing expectations and i've never done it before blah blah blah i'm going to go for this course over here that tells me i can make money starting this new fresh crazy business that's what they're going to go for and then real estate agents are going to be repulsed by any course that even is sort of for beginners why because they are not a beginner why would they buy a course that's sort of for a beginner if i'm buying a set of golf clubs and i'm an expert golfer i'm going to buy expert level golf clubs i'm not going to buy an expert level a golf club that sort of works for beginners and is sort of awesome for experts i'm going to buy something that's tailored for me if i'm a beginner i'm not going to buy expert golf clubs i'm not going to buy middle tier golf clubs i'm going to buy beginner golf clubs so don't be in the middle tier because you can't scale the metal tier okay you can you can stay very low scale and so a very expensive product of super targeted people do very well you can go mega high scale and sell to mass people so for example if you want to take over the golf market guess what 90 80 percent of the golf market i would not be surprised is mostly people who play once a year or are beginners in golf and if you're gonna get the largest chunk of that market you got to make it for the beginner golfer the end and the five percent of the market that is expert level golfers that will spend ten thousand dollars on a pair of clubs they're not gonna buy anything else except those ten thousand dollar club so just make the ten thousand dollar clubs insult them that's how you're gonna make the money on facebook the next thing i'm gonna tell you that is so incredibly important is look at the overall stats so if i go and look at let's just say last 30 days on this okay so i go and look at these stats right here a lot of people are going to go and they're going to look at like this one uh we're once let's just even go like we'll go to like delivery okay and they're going to look at all these stats video engagement they're going to dig through all of these these are all useless these are all useless stats there's only one stat that matters and a few major stats after that that are important and the best way you can make progress in ads is understand this simple concept roi is all that matter matters okay because in context of everything this is it cpc cpm all of this is irrelevant why because you can have a great cpc and a bad roi you can have a great cpm and a bad roi what i look at at ads let's say i'm running a webinar funnel or let's say i'm running a call funnel what i'm going to look at is key metrics this would be cost per lead okay everybody at ops in cost per call and an overall in context of roi if roi is bad none of these matter but you have to understand that let's say cost per call and cpl or cost per opt-in these indicate under a reflection of the other stats okay so look we could have a great cpm but if our cost per call is high it doesn't matter if we have a great cpm and our cost per lead is high doesn't matter what is going to control cpo and cost per click and an inflation roi is going to be the message of the ad so for example we could have an ad that has terrible cost per click but a good cpl and an amazing roi an amazing roi you could also have an ad that has a great cost per click a great cpl and a terrible roi why is this let's imagine i was running an ad in the info marketing space okay and i was selling a ten thousand dollar mastermind well i could have an ad that talks about beginning your first business online and is very very broad and appeals to everybody then i can have an opt-in that appeals to everybody so i can have a great cost per click attract tons of people into the funnel a great cpl tons of people who are really cheap leads and facebook guys are opting in and none of them buy the product okay so what you need to do is you don't want to be looking at cpc or cpm you want to make sure your ad is bringing in the right people which is going to be reflected by your roi and then you want to go and once that roi is there focus on the key metrics right here what i focus on high risk is exclusively the cost per call since i know i'm bringing in the right people at this point so look my cost per call right here is going to then be a reflection of my cpm and my cpc if my ad is doing its job and getting the right people in based on the roi and cost per call then it's naturally going to go down and so then what i try and do while focusing on the message of the ad is lower the cost per call by making the ad and the opt-in or the the funnel better okay that's what i'm going to try and lower i'm never going to try and lower these other stats that i can't control you can't control your cpm and frankly your cpm doesn't matter this is what matters right here focus on the key metrics finally that being said my last tip for you is again get the metrics that actually matter one of the biggest problems with facebook ads i'm going to show you straight up is that the attribution is usually not correct because facebook is wildly inaccurate with its its view view conversions if people skim through an ad okay i skim past this ad right here i look at this for two seconds skin pass facebook is going to give itself credit if you don't have last click only attribution on okay on top of that you have to understand if you have a business as any other traffic sources like look if you have a business that's just exclusively if you have a small e-commerce business for example and you don't have any back-end sales you don't have any other interaction with your business besides the ad and the sale not going to be entirely hard for facebook to track but if you have a business where you have google searches you have ads you have youtube ads running you have an email list you have people just organically interacting with the business on a daily basis coming back and buying more facebook is going to start giving it credit for like literally everything because this prom right here if there's ever a click at any time it's just gonna give itself credit because it doesn't talk to the rest of your business this results in you doing all sorts of goof troopery the biggest thing would be investing in ads that aren't paying off like for example facebook said this one generated two calls it didn't it didn't and what i'm looking at right here is the hi-ros chrome extension which again i can go look at all the very very deep traffic tracking that's in the hirosh dashboard but if i just click here i can go and see exactly who came in and i can see exactly where they clicked and where they came from from i can see everything this person did and i can see all the ads this person clicked on the way there you can see they actually clicked multiple facebook ads came through and then came through our email list and came in this is where they came in at okay click clicked welcome on one of our emails so i can see exactly where this guy came from and i can see that this guy's first click wasn't even on the date that facebook was giving it facebook gave credit right here okay which it did and so of course the credit right here is accurate but this guy right here actually clicked for the first time in 2020 all right almost six months ago so you need to have correct attribution because you're gonna be investing in ads that aren't actually paying off and you're gonna be killing ads that are paying off for example this one right here reported two calls i actually got four calls from okay at this point right here the cp cost per call right here is acceptable for me even at 150 bucks uh at 71 dollars actually but i'm actually getting 35 calls i need to be like quadrupling down on this ad on top of that feeding this data back to facebook is incredibly important i don't do it on this account because it's one of my smaller accounts my bigger accounts that i use for more serious business stuff i feed the data back to facebook and it allows the the ai to optimize much better because again it's missing half the data right here that it should be optimizing for so what i suggest you do get some type of attribution software if you're interested in having that and not wasting money on bad ads and saving a lot more money on ads that aren't actually performing well and increasing ads that are performing well and then combining it with ai optimization to make your ads perform much better overall check out hirose below this video there's no reason to be running any ads at scale without something like high risk and again we guarantee that you're going to see a 15 to 20 minimum increase in your ads or you don't pay for it so check it out when the video's done maybe and really guys that's that's the video for today if you do those five things that most people don't do it's so simple those things that broke down most people just don't do those and it's why they are wasting so much money and time on facebook ads they're spending so much time in their dashboard and playing with all these irrelevant stats and going to agencies and all these things when it's really quite simple if you just nail the things that actually matter that being said guys subscribe to the channel i'm releasing three videos like this week going forward to covering youtube ads funnels everything
