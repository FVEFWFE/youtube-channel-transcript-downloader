================================================================================

how's it going welcome back to the facebook advanced ad course where i show you everything i've done to scale business past six hundred thousand a month in revenue off of about a hundred thousand a month in ad spend in this video i'm going to be getting into advanced facebook ad targeting which is kind of ironic because if you understand how facebook ad targeting works you can actually scale it really far using chimpanzee level tactics but i'm going to show you the whole nine yards and everything i've used the scale also what i know just is working across the entire industry that being said i'm not going to waste your time because i hate when people waste my time so we're just going to hop straight into this ad targeting lesson i'll just show you everything we're doing and everything i think you should do this will at least help you get a little less confused about scaling ads and hopefully help you scale a metric ton because if you get this going from fifty dollars a day hundred dollars a day five hundred dollars a day a thousand dollars a day so on and so forth not too difficult okay guys so let's talk about facebook targeting and what facebook targeting is more of is less about knowing technical details and hoopla what i see people constantly they're trying to do to either sell their facebook ad services or just because they think this is how you should think about ads is they try to complicate everything they optimize down the demographics they have all these weird little habits like having 50 different ad sets targeting the same campaign the thing you need to understand about ads is that if you're having to get complicated you're being stupid and i'm not doing that to insult anybody that has a phd in complication of ads i'm doing it because that's just the truth because the thing is when you're complicating ads you're trying to make an ad that doesn't work work that's the first thing that's going on right there nobody just ever had an ad that was a home run was like you know what you need to do is make 50 different ad sets targeting the same audience so like the algorithm will like do this weird thing and that's not how it works okay i have ads that generate 10x rois and we have the most basic kindergarten targeting you could possibly imagine and the reason for that is because facebook ads are more about an understanding of how you're reaching the audiences the audiences you are reaching what's going on in the background and more so how the audience changes as you scale up that's the reason why most people get broken is because of a few bad understandings of the ad platform and if you have these understandings you don't have to do complicated stuff and the complicated stuff never works long term anyways so there's no point in doing it so first off the number one thing we need to focus on when it comes to understandings is what's happening okay so let's cover a few things first up how you want to be running facebook audiences is of course there's two types of audiences on facebook there's the interest targeting that you can target and the ad manager and we'll hop into the ad manager and i'll kind of break this down though this isn't a beginner's course okay so i'm not gonna be breaking under the first audience and stuff like that um and it's not interesting it's interest but there's interest-based targeting and then there's going to be look-alike audiences which you're going to be generating based off of the data you collect from people visiting your website opting in buying stuff and then there's also going to be your pixel and your conversion settings that you decide to target i'm going to give you a quick refresher basically what happens is when you run an ad and somebody hits your pixel let's say the person opts in what facebook is going to do is going to fill in that this opt-in looks like this type of person this person has this interest they manage this demographic they're this gender yada yada and it's going to feed the pixel this data and it's going to use that to say this is what this opt-in looks like and if you want to get more customers like it target people like this okay and so if i set the conversion setting inside of my ad to opt-ins and i've fed this pixel right here tons of people who have opted in it's going to then be far more efficient at finding opt-ins for me this type of targeting right here if you're using just a facebook pixel can turn into a whole bag of horribleness because what usually happens is if you don't have proper tracking on the ads and i'm not going to talk about high risk much in this video i promise to you but if you are tracking from ads first off the things that are usually easiest to track like opt-ins aren't actually the best thing to target and then two what is going to be happening is if you're targeting something like a sale a lot of times facebook is going to miss a lot of sales let's say it only catches six out of ten sales that come in and what's gonna happen is this four to ten sales that were missed it's gonna mark these as people it shouldn't target and then it's going to have all sorts of faulty data it's gonna avoid people that it should be targeting and you're just working with six out of 10 pixel optimization instead of 10 out of 10 which if you know how numbers work is usually better but the thing i'm trying to say right here is all these things combine together and we graduate and grow our targeting over time using these things this is what i like to call facebook graduating so what's gonna happen is let's just break this down in three phases just because the highest number i can count two is three when you first start off you're going to be using base audiences and your pixel is not going to be trained and i want to share one thing don't lose your mind over the pixel i've had ad accounts where i don't use any targeting or i use completely untrained pixel i get the same exact results the same exact results as a trained pixel so it varies but we're going to be using base audiences which are going to be interest audiences and i'm just going to refer them as base audiences for now because that's what i just use in my head now we're also going to have a bad pixel that's not trained and so really we're just going to send this fishing rod out into a cold pond of predetermined audiences for us so interest-based audiences would be you know what they are if you're watching this video in your advance if you're not go back in the kiddie pool okay but interest-based audience would be like people that like shopify or people that like tony robbins or something like that that's what they're interested in at least i'm not gonna explain everything that goes into audiences and interest though because again there's tons of kiddie pool videos on youtube this isn't a kiddie pool video now what we're going to do at this point in time is we're going to be feeding this pixel we're also going to be gathering data so let's imagine we're running a webinar in this situation we're writing anything where we have legion and we're sending people to an opt-in they put in their information they end up on a thank you page what we're then going to have is we're going to be able to build up an audience of let's say about 100 people and be able to create a look-alike audience and so then we can transition and graduate to tight look-alike audiences so this would be one percent look-alike audiences so people that facebook will go and generate an audience of a million people um who closely resemble these people that came in and so sometimes you want you can use a hundred people especially if it's buyers if it's opt-ins you probably want more but a hundred people is what you need to really make a decent lookalike audience again you're going to constantly want to be recreating look like audiences as you get more data as well because it's just common sense okay so what we're going to then do with this is again we'll have this one percent audience that looks like people to devops then people that bought our product and whatnot and primarily we'll start off with our weaker lookalike audiences and so that's why we specifically want to use this one percent setting right here because we want to be as close to this as possible but then we'll also have a trained up pixel that is a little bit more competent than this pixel right here and so our targeting will get better as we make it a little bit broader but still very targeted because it's like these this audience right here now what's going to then happen after a while is we're going to have tons of data we're going to have lots of buyers we're gonna have lots of phone calls we have lots of opt-ins and so we're gonna have a lot of data to make a lot of look-alike audiences and of course our best look-alike audience is going to be buyers in theory okay of course it's going to be our best in theory 50 of the time it's your best audience i guarantee it it will work at least 10 percent of the time it's the best thing ever all right so if you get my joke right there we're going to create audiences off of all these things and what we can then do as we train up our pixel to be more accurate is we make these two percent audiences and three percent audiences and two percent audiences and three percent audiences and once you get to three percent audiences you're dealing with audiences like five million people or somewhere around there three to five so that's more than enough for the goal of getting you to five thousand dollars a day ad spend with this video and as we do this of course the pixel is getting more and more data it's getting more data on what a buyer looks like or what an opt-in looks like or what a call looks like and we always really want to optimize for buyers and it depends on the business model you're in for example if you're an e-commerce you should have no problem optimizing for buyers if you're doing a call funnel you it's it's hard to optimize for buyers right away because you need lots of phone calls to finally do that if you're doing a webinar funnel uh or something with a longer call to se or click the sale we're still going to want to optimize for buyers because opt-ins are usually a really poor indicator of who's going to buy just who's going to opt in so people that opt in for free stuff are usually different than people to actually buy stuff so you're going to need to keep that in mind anyways what's going to happen is we can increase our look-alike audiences add more the pixel is going to get warmed up and we're gonna be able to increase the size of the audiences now what i want you to actually do as you do this is once you get to this point right here you should be actually making some pretty decent money and you should be testing this and being somewhat reckless with this so i mean once you get 100 people if you want to make a three percent audience and just go for it by all means do it part of being an advanced facebook ad runner is being willing to test things and lose a little money on some tests but eventually we're going to graduate three percent audiences we really don't even have to do this in some niches we don't have to go as proud like at highros we really don't need to go this broad and we're gonna have a really trained up okay and by the way the best way to train up a pixel to be way more accurate is again to use accurate tracking for example hirose and pass that data back to the pixel so the ai can be 10 times smarter because the facebook tracking isn't accurate i've proven like six other videos this is well known moving on this is what i mean by facebook graduating this is what i'm referred to in this video and that's the type of targeting you want to use now we can always use base audiences we can't always stick to our one percent audiences we can also use a three percent audiences you don't need to kill these things as you grow them either okay thing is base audiences can be somewhat hard to scale because they're a little bit less targeted but as your pixel gets more trained you can use all of these pretty efficiently okay but you're not gonna be able to jump straight into a three percent audience with an untrained pixel in theory you can try it and it's worked for me in the past but i just want you to know my train of thought now here's a much more important understanding this is why people do complicated stuff because they're stupid you have to understand that as your expand you have to understand this as you increase your ad spend your audiences expand so if i take an audience from 100 to a thousand dollars a day you have to understand with like a look-alike audience of one percent that's a million people you're not gonna you're not gonna cap that out you're not gonna be running in the ad fatigue with that unless you're spending a ton of money every single day especially when you get into three percent audiences of three to five million and what happens is people start scaling their ads they think they're hitting ad fatigue or some mystical beast is requiring them to do more complicated things because they're getting great uh conversion ratios and cost per sale or cost per opt-in at a hundred dollars a day and as they get to a thousand dollars a day on an ad set it all just goes to hell and what you need to understand is that when you're spending 100 a day 50 bucks a day on an ad set what is happening is facebook is going micro targeted with your audience and it's targeting people that are baby level easy to convert but as your ad spend grows if you want to scale you start targeting people that are more broad this is why you have to understand the market size and the type of product and offer you're making like i talked about in the past few months because if you want to scale at any level you can't live in the baby pool facebook you can live in the baby pool facebook and be very profitable but you'll never scale okay you're never going to have a giant business and that's because you're playing on easy mode right here you got to think about the difficulty to convert people as you scale this up an audience at 100 a day has nothing to do with an audience at a thousand dollars a day okay and then making 10 audiences at 100 a day is not a way to make an audience that's a thousand dollars a day that's not how you scale either that's just how you make things complicated and stupid because eventually these same people start getting the same ads over and over again and then like it starts branching out it just gets confused and it doesn't work okay so you have to understand that when you're going from a hundred a thousand dollars a day on an ad set or any type of ad spend you start seeing all your numbers start going up it's not a sign that you're hitting ad fatigue dude there's like a billion people on facebook there's five million people in your audience i spent nearly a thousand dollars yesterday on this ad set only reached 10 000 people reach-wise okay that's people skimming past it it's people skimming past it that's not a person actually sitting down and like looking at it it would take me literally two three ten thousand dollars a day to even be cracking any type of ad fatigue where a person sing the ad over and over and over again it's not happening to you that's happening and it's not happening what's happening is your ad sucks and it's not positioned in the market well enough this is why most people's ads die on youtube and facebook all the time inside of my ad mastermind iron whenever i'm working with people inside there they always think that their ads are hitting ad fatigue and it's not it's because they need to reposition their offer restructure their offer to work for a more broad audience or if you have a very high ticket offer make it more high ticket and work with these micro audiences because this is how you decide to make the big bucks with the micro audiences by having a very high ticket offer and sometimes audiences are not going to be this big okay they're not going to be this big and so you need to be able to work in this area right here so that's what you need to understand and what's happening right here as you're going up and doing this facebook is having to get more and more expanding with the people targets and thus your number is going to increase if your ads are not good enough if your offer is not positioned well that will also destroy it as well that's what's happening so what audiences do you start off with on facebook well there's two types of different targetings you're going to want to use there's going to be b2b and super high ticket call based targeting and there's going to be more mass market targeting which is going to be your e-commerce or mass-market info offers okay um and this is just what i've seen countless times again in my ad mastermind i just really give people my targetings that i'm using let people look over my shoulder but i'm just gonna do the best i can for you right here okay because i'm not gonna dig into my ad account and share that on youtube with tens of thousands of people so look mass market audiences you're going to want to target your competitors if you can find them on there so for example if you are selling a software that helps people with their businesses maybe use salesforce or something like that you're going to want to use similar brands so for example if you were selling like a make money online course you could use something like tony robbins okay so that's like that's not technically a competitor but he's in self-help so you could use that as a targeting you can also use tools people use that would represent their interests so for example a person's in the e-commerce you could target their interests as shopify okay so these are going to be the three ones that you want to use there's there's tons more you can use magazines and whatnot but this is really where you're going to get the best bang for your buck nine out of 10 times if you want to use other interest if you're watching this video you're not a kiddie pool marketer you're more than welcome to that's what i use your direct competitors similar brands that have like similar people in them and then the tools people use and that's what i use for mass market b2b is very similar it's very similar as in you can transfer these audiences over but one thing that also helps a whole lot is you start throwing in job titles or positions or their facebook page admin status okay so if you want to go in there and you throw everybody that has ceo owner entrepreneur ad manager in their job title you can easily do that in the job title targeting for b2b targeting and this will help you just a wee bit again i've had great success just transferring these over uh dodo version and using it for b2b as well but that also helps as well so i want to include it in there so what you do is you layer it with job titles positions and then you can also target people that own are admins of facebook groups and those are usually going to be people that might be entrepreneurs or business owners or something like that this is what works very very very well now do you want to go in there and play the demographics and whatnot usually the facebook optimization is going to handle that for you and as long as you're aware of the ad positioning that i talked about in the last video okay not running an ad that has a bad headline in the sidebar that doesn't work for sidebars you're going to do just fine this is what i'll use and then what we do so then the next thing we're going to want to do is we're going to want to set our pixel targeting and so here's where you're going to want here's what you're going to want to do for e-commerce or anything where you get a quick sale you want to just optimize it for the sale now for webinars and sales call funnels you want to split test it okay you should honestly just try optimizing for the call if you're doing a call funnel right away or the sale if you're doing a webinar funnel now here's the goofy wonky thing if i go and flip on my hi-ros data and again my job in in this video is not to push hiros on you i just i think it's absolutely crazy to be running a webinar or a call funnel especially or any type of funnel but especially those ones without proper tracking because you can see right here it literally does not catch the calls half the time you got a call coming in right here it didn't catch it got two calls coming in right here didn't catch it and more importantly we have sales coming in here and what i like to optimize for a lot of times is sales because the sale is what actually matters i can get tons of cheap calls but people who are cheap callers aren't people that routinely buy that's incredibly important when it comes to doing or tracking or optimizing any calls and it's nearly like facebook literally will not track sales for webinars or sales call funnels long term webinar funnels like good luck you'll catch like 30 50 of them call funnels you're not gonna catch any of them and so first off you want to pass this data back to facebook and optimize around this because obviously it's better to optimize around the two calls that came in instead of zero calls that were reported right here same thing going on right here that's gonna allow us to optimize better and have better pixel targeting on top of that we just won't literally kill ads that are literally generating calls for us i would have turned this ad off right here i would have turned this ad off right here and this ad literally generated me five thousand dollars for like 19 phone call i would have literally turned this ad off right here so not only would it make me make stupid decisions it's also optimizing around goofy data that isn't going to help me okay and you're going to run into the same exact thing with google ads as well and so it's very hard to optimize for calls and sales on any type of funnel with this type of data you're even going to see an e-commerce or short click to sale funnels okay and so i wanted to point that out you want to optimize for the call or sale on a webinar funnel or a call funnel because these are the people that actually buy people that opt-in are people that opt-in for free stuff okay that's like if you were selling cheese at a grocery store and you're optimizing for people to take free samples well people that take free samples aren't necessarily going to be the people that buy the cheese what you want to do is give free samples to people that are likely to buy the cheese that's how you optimize the free samples okay we could get like 50 cent opt-ins with people that have no chance of buying or calling same thing with e-commerce okay you can feed the data right back to your pixels well on facebook and you want to do that because again you're only going to catch like 70 of your sales in e-commerce usually that's what we see and if you have cross traffic going on with like google and organic stuff running oh my gosh all right so i'm just not even going to talk about that anymore because it frustrates me and if you're not doing that and you're running a serious ad funnel you're being an ad goblin okay just one of those crazy little things from lord of the rings it just has trash everywhere and it's just like eating bugs and stuff i don't know how to help you now then at that point we're going to try and get 100 of anything okay because the issue i brought up with optins doesn't apply to making a look-alike audience you could make a look-like audience of a hundred opt-ins okay so you make it look like audience of that at one percent or in e-commerce you can go make a look-alike audience of people that clicked your ad you can test that out look like audience out might not be the best one but you can definitely make a look like onto your first hundred sales once you have that you're really in a good spot in e-commerce and then we're just gonna keep going and keep making larger look-alike audiences based on all of our data so you're eventually gonna have a hundred opt-ins you're gonna have 100 calls you're gonna have 100 buyers so on and so forth you want to do that for either type of these so what we can do then is we make a one percent lookalike audience of our calls and then of our buyers and we can slowly just start upgrading these audiences to two percent and three percent especially as we start getting past like five hundred dollars a day on any of these audiences five hundred to a thousand dollars a day you're going to start hitting a little bit of pushback especially in info marketing e-commerce maybe not so much because you can go way broader with e-commerce on but same exact thing you would just want to make look-alike audiences of your buyers go one percent to two percent to three percent and then you can really start cracking out to the five or ten percent if you have a mass-market product and that's literally all you need to do i i told you this is kindergarten easy there isn't really that much to do after you understand what's going to be happening the main thing you need to look out for as as you start growing this when you go from 100 a day to a thousand dollars a day understand that these ads down here that are meant for a micro market and if they work for the micro market doesn't mean they're gonna work for the larger market when you get to a thousand dollars a day because again facebook has to go and expand what it's looking at this is one of the reasons why people have such trouble on youtube ads if you ever watch the youtube ads course uh that i've also released on here 100 free better than anything you can buy as well that's why most people get messed up in youtube whenever people come into our ad mastermind for youtube ads which if you're interested in that you can get details on that below i'll hop on a call with you and we can talk about your ads and what you've got going on and i'll help you out with that but more importantly when they come in the problem is there's no hundred dollars a day level at youtube okay you go straight into this thousand dollar a day blue ocean kind of thing and or ocean kind of thing and so you need to be able to make a broad ad right away and most people are so used to this area and facebook and they try and take this over here and it doesn't work but it's also the same thing that messes people up when they go on facebook ads because they try and take this type of ad and take it over here and they're like what's my targeting no it's not you can use look like audiences tell kingdom come so that being said guys that is what i use when it comes to facebook ad targeting two things look guys if you're watching this at this point i can't stress enough how important tracking is i made it very clear when it comes in terms of your ai and making scaling decisions so far i would really suggest that you go below if you're thinking about running ads seriously or you are running ads seriously and just book a high ros consultation if you do not see huge tracking results and make your ads more profitable and save you a ton of money and make your ai more optimized you literally do not pay no money okay there's we have a 90-day guarantee if people don't see results at scale their ads they don't pay so the worst thing that could happen if you go and book that consultation and come on the hi-ros your your ads stay where they're at right now the best thing that happened is you're suddenly like oh wait now i don't have to like make stupid ad and i will stop killing ads that are making me money and wasting money on ads that aren't and optimizing my ai off of goblin data on top of that if you would actually like help with your ads you'd like to see my actual ad targetings i'm using actually get guidance and whatnot go below and just book a consultation with me below and we will actually just go into your ad account and talk about how you can be scaling your type of offer uh primarily on facebook and youtube ads where youtube is a little bit of my speciality but as you can see i'm pretty damn confident in facebook as well and more so talk about how you can position your offer how you should structure your funnels and how you should really approach your market which is far more important to and youtube if you're interested in that just go below and schedule a consultation with me on top of that go and check out the hi-ros facebook group on facebook just go into the search bar type in hi-ros you should see hi-ros forum pop-up it has over 50 million dollars a month in media buyers in it meaning our members spend at least 50 million dollars a month combined on ads there is a qualification to join you have to be spending a significant amount of ad spend but if you can get in there it is the best group for media buyers online that being said also subscribe this video because we're not even done releasing this facebook course yet here on youtube it's 100 free i'm gonna be releasing the next one probably in the next few days so be sure to subscribe and i even included a few other videos after this video and there's also a link to our entire course that's on youtube as well if you're interested in learning that as well below this video so that's a lot of stuff but one of those things might interest you if not i'm sorry i couldn't be more alluring i'll see you in the next video [Music] [Applause]
