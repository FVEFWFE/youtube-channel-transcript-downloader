do you get super aroused when you go to the 99-cent store well this is for you because what we're going to be focusing on in this video is how to get super cheap clicks on facebook oh the dollar clicks remember those when you first got started everyone's like dollar clicks make a million dollars a day we're not gonna get quite that cheap but what i'm going to show you in this video my fellow hyruleans by the way this is alex becker ceo of hyros you know a company that helps everybody track their ads and get a much higher roi on their ads and then feed it back to iii and get even more roi on that it's that that company that's what i do but more importantly i'm gonna be showing you in this video how to get crazy cheap clicks on facebook by what i've done to get really low clicks on facebook but more importantly get the actions that you're looking for the sale the cpl the clicks as well and the views much cheaper than everybody else i've used this in e-commerce i've used this in sas i've used this in consulting and info businesses even if you're selling kangaroos this will probably work for you so we're just gonna dive straight into it okay guys so this is going to be super weird because if you're watching this video you probably look at all your stats in your ads manager you look at the cpm cost per view cost that's cost per click cost per click and i all the time when i help people with their ads they they have a they usually have huge spreadsheets with all these stats and this is what they think determines or is the indicator of how well their ads are doing so originally when people first got on the facebook and so this day what they focus on a ton of times is cheap clicks and i'm going to be straight up with you in this video i tricked you into watching it because i know you probably are looking for cheap clicks too but cheap clicks are not the thing you want to look for they're an indicator of something else which i'm going to show you and if you understand this something else you will get cheap clicks but you also get cheap everything else because let's let's really understand one simple concept we can take the hundred stats in the dashboard right you can you can have an entire board with all your stats right here but at the end of the day there's really only two stats that matter in your business actually there's only one it's roi every one of these stats could be completely out of control just broken by standards but if your roi is large then you it doesn't really matter if you're doing a 4x roi it doesn't matter and so it's such a mistake to focus on these things right here now there's also other indicators in your business that are going to indicate whether an ad is working or not for example if you're running a deep funnel that has an opt-in in the front of it your indicator is going to be cpl and the cpl is the main thing you want to be looking at because if the cpl goes down all of these stats right here go down as well so if you just focus on what controls the cpl which is the message behind the ad the quality of your opt-in and understanding of your customer then that's just going to go it's going to plummet and then these things will plummet as well and it's so much easier to just focus on the message of your ad and your opt-in than it is all these other stats the same thing applies with an e-commerce store the main thing that actually matters is the cost per sale which is going to be controlled by how well the ad performs which is again you're thinking well isn't it all these things sort of sort of i'm going to show you how to get all these things super low without thinking about them and then also the offer that you're offering okay if you have a call funnel it's going to be cost per call and then all of these only thing that actually matters behind all of these ones is roi and the crazy thing about this is in almost every business i see people operate around the cost per lead or cost per call because they can't actually track their roi which is again i'm not going to pump high roast in this thing but if you don't see the roi of your ads truly and you're missing like 50 of your sales you're optimizing around bogus stats and i guarantee you're losing like 20 30 percent a year try out hiros uh anyways so look what you need to do instead is when i'm running an ad okay and how i get my ads super cheap and let me show you this concept right here in google to make it a little bit more clear so you're probably thinking all right but isn't this about facebook yes but it's just so much easier to show you this because youtube's a little bit more straight to the point because there's less variables you just have a video on facebook you have ad copy you have the video you have the images you have the headline there's a lot of things to play with and so well let's just keep it simple like this you can see right here my cost per view on youtube what most people are going to try and do on facebook and youtube is they're going to is they're going to try and control their cost per view by editing their targeting and their demographics and all the little they're bidding they're going to try and bid to lower their cost per view so check this out right here you can see three different messages right here this one is actually really really blatantly obvious so you can see here's a message right here where the focus of the ad is saved 20 on ads okay the message of this ad is how ai can be used to scale ads these are two different messages the the communication in both these ads is focusing on two different benefits and so you can see right here the cost per view on this video is 30 cents the cost per view on this video is 11 cents why because this concept this message this benefit is far more attractive to the viewer than this one this is what's going on right here so the way you actually get cheap clicks and cheap views is not to play with your targeting i could go out there and play with the targeting on this ad the demographics and all the bidding i could maybe get this down to 25 cents there's no way i could plummet it much further because people don't respond to this benefit this message right here doesn't stand out to them this one right here stands out to them like a sore thumb so then let's look at these ads right here okay again we see this one right here scale ads scale ads 38 cents per view this one focusing on ai 21 cents per view but then we can also look at the different messages of the ai so let's this this benefit right here you can see really doesn't respond to customers customers don't don't they just don't care about saving money on their ads that's why the cost per view is high not because the targeting or some toggle inside of adwords is messed up now if we come down here we can see different messages from this ai and locks ads i'm pretty sure this one right here focuses on a different message and it's shot from my iphone this one right here at my desk where i have a different message at the start of the ad i believe this one right here talks about the benefits of ads this one talks about ai scaling ads okay this one talks about how ai optimization works people are interested what what am i seeing from this people are not interested in saving money on their ads they're not really interested in how ai optimization works they are interested on ai optimization scaling their ads further and so this tells me what the customer's thinking and if i want to get cheap clicks if i actually go and look at the the cost per conversion i'm sure this all lines up right here we're just going to stick to cost per view right here you're going to see that this ad right here simply performs better okay now you can see over time this one was the winner okay so this one right here it's focusing again on ai scaling ads so this one is about 22 cents right here okay and so you can see all the ones that focus on scaling ads are the winners all the ones that focus on saving money or how it works are the losers that's what you need to focus on with your ads and so when you're looking at your facebook ads it's exact same concept and my facebook ad account it's really hard to show you this because i already know this and so i converted all my ads to focus on scaling ads with ai in fact if you go and look at my main funnel right here you can see that how highros uses ai tracking insulin increase ad roi and so here's the bigger secret to everything i'm showing you right here yes i totally tricked you to watch this video because i'm going to teach you the most powerful ad tech that there is what you want to do with your ads is you want to see the messages and ads that people connect to so when you run facebook ads don't go out there and run like five ads and then look at their costs and start playing with the demographics of targeting the age the the income these things these can come i'm not saying these things are completely unimportant but these are these are the things that are going to get you a 20 boost what i'm showing you here is going to get you the 80 boost what you want to do when you're running ads on facebook or youtube is make ads with different messages so for example how i got the high-risk ads to crush it okay again these things pump out i spent about 3 000 a day right now we do anywhere from 15 000 to on good days 35 000 revenue back that's cash revenue that's not payment plans that's not like projected revenue that's not including the mrr that comes from that's just cash in and so what i'll do is when i was running the hirose ads originally i made one ad actually i made three ads i focused on increasing ad roi i mean it on saving ad roi and then i made another one on uh just gains just overall benefits and i made another one on ai all right so when i looked at the cost per lead which is actually what i look at i don't even look at cost per view because here's the thing the one with the lowest cost per view and the most clicks is going to be the ones the one that people are most interested in and so naturally the one with the lowest cpl is going to usually have the lowest cost per view so i don't look at these numbers right here i'm just showing you exactly what i already know that being said when we go into it i originally ran these ads i noticed people really connected with ai and then they also respond to this one but they respond most strongly to the ai so i scratch these two ones right here all right and so let's say my cpl my cost per call this time was like 350 dollars all right so that's that's we still do very well at high risk with that but not as well as we could if it was lower duh all right so what i did is i combined those two messages together i said okay people really respond to ai so what can i do i made an ai ad focusing on scaling an ai ad focusing on saving and ai ad focusing just on the overall benefits how it works the tech behind it and how you're behind the times and then let's say i just added another concept i don't quite remember it was very clear to me that people instantly responded to this one the cpl uh the cost per call on these ones i was originally running an opt-in first the cpl was much lower on the opt-in page okay so if i i made this page originally and i tried a few different headlines as well alright so this one worked really really well in combination with the scaling ad so i really noticed that people are very interested in the ai combination but then what i did next is i just removed this opt-in and i switched straight to just the landing page that goes for this the call i noticed the ads that focused on scaling with i did exceptionally well and so what i then did all right now the cost per view and the cost per click plummeted okay and also the costs were called plummeted so it got down from like 350 to like 250. and so then what i did is i looked at this page and i said how can i make it line up with ad because this is obviously the message that people respond to best so what i then did is i changed the headline and i made the focus of the top of the page b about scaling ads with ai boom cost per call dropped to about a hundred bucks a call 100 to 150 bucks a call i mean a few days ago we're getting like 50 60 calls and we close at a extremely high rate at highrose and so that's how we get away with spending almost nothing on ads and doing such high rois this is the secret to it i know i tricked you to get here but if you're focusing on your cost per click and your cost per view and and all of these other stats you're confusing yourself because what you need to be focusing on is not the stats you need to be focusing on what customers are responding to when you do that and then you focus your ad creative and your landing pages around what they're telling you they're interested in all these stats will naturally start going down in the way you want them to that's the lesson for today and if you can then work your ad copy around that holy moly and then this is the fun little bonus tip for you check out these ads right here okay check how little i spend on these things look at the cost compared to the roi hundred and ninety eight thousand to five thousand thirty two thousand to ten thousand one thousand four hundred to forty two thousand what you need to focus on next and i want to point out right here i'm not looking at google stats so and more of the stories focus on the ads that are actually getting an roi because i look at cost per call and cpl add to carts or whatever other metrics you might be looking at but i really optimize around is this right here okay and then the reason why these ads do really well is because then i pass this data back to google i pass this data back to facebook and it optimizes around this data right here not cost per call and cost per lead like so many people too and so my final tip for you if you're obsessed with stats actually track the correct stats and then optimize around roi ignore everything else make and optimize your funnel around what customers are telling you they're your cpl your cpv all the stats will go down and then when you do that then focus on and optimize and scale your ads based around roi not those relevant stats you could have the best cpl cost per click on planet earth and if you're not pumping out an roi it doesn't matter it doesn't matter okay and by the way what i'm using to track this with is hyrus i'm not trying to be biased i'm not trying to throw it in your face there is no other tool on planet earth that does okay and puts it in your ad manager like this and then passes it all back to it there's no tool that
