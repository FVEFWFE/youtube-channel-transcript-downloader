what i'm about to show you this is like basically using sugar to attract ants if you apply what i'm going to show you to your images on facebook ads even on your youtube videos whatever you're doing you're going to get significantly more clicks you're going to attract more people and it's just that simple this is the complete basics but nobody knows this nobody uses this but the basics of getting the human eye to pay attention to something and then making the human brain go i'm interested in finding out more about this something if you follow this very simple pattern that every single top youtuber uses and apply it to ads you're gonna get more clicks you're gonna get cheaper clicks you're gonna get more of your target audience paying attention to your ad you're gonna get the people that you want to click your ad to click your ad i cannot make it any more simple and the reason why i know this i've grown multiple businesses to eight figures exclusively using ads i'm the ceo of hirose which means i see the data across the entire ad industry i see what's working and i've worked and have the highest six seven and eight figure result ratio of my ad mastermind of any ad mastermind online meaning i work with tons of other that are running tons of ads and i see exactly what's working i see what doesn't work what i'm going to show you in this video is exactly what works by the way if you want to check out that mastermind get some coaching on your ads and scale as well there's a link below but first let me show you exactly how this works so let's just dive into this because frankly this is probably going to be one of the most important marketing lessons you ever learn because it's simple and it applies to virtually anything whether you're making youtube video thumbnails whether you're making facebook ad thumbnails whether you're trying to get a person's attention you need to understand how the human eye works what it's going to think and how it behaves so look when you're making images for your ads specifically but this can apply to anything you need to understand a few simple basic concepts when a person is skimming through something you need to understand that i must focus on one thing and so the focus of an image must be on one thing and what you need to have happen is the way image should work is the first thing that should happen is there needs to be something centralized that grabs the person's main attention and then there needs to be something that creates a question maybe it could be the image itself which simply is happening in the the image alone but usually it's going to be something side or beside the image that's going to create that significant question it makes them go what is going on here i'm interested okay that is the most important thing when making an image for an ad and then what you're going to get them to do when you're making an ad is then interact and understand what they're clicking on or what they're going for with the headlines or maybe the headlines that you'll start playing in the video of the ad as well see what a lot of people do with their images is they try to fit the entire message into the image at once so they'll have like a picture of themselves and they'll have some headline here and then they'll have some other image right here and there's so many things going on this doesn't pull the eye into anything and it makes it very easy to scroll past and very easy to ignore and some examples of this would be like this ad right here now there's all sorts of bad things going on with this headline right here but there's just a zillion different things happening we've got this pink thing right here we got this guy standing right here we got a headline right here nothing particularly creates a question of what's happening here what's going on and most importantly there's nothing for the eye to settle on so you're just going to scroll right past this thing okay we can keep going and looking at other images right here okay we got we got yoda right here it's a very bland there's nothing here that creates a what's going on here you know immediately this is an ad it doesn't perk your interest and there's nothing no main benefit or anything to really call out to the person right here now let's look at basically the master of doing this it's it's mr beast so if you go look at any of his videos what's happening in all these images right here let's not even look at the headline yet we have a picture of him right here in a coffin very bright you can notice that everything is extremely bright in the image why because this captures a person's attention bright things attract the eye you can notice really bright colors in every single and that's one huge takeaway right there now the next thing you really want to focus on when you're looking at this is look at how there's one central thing going on in the image or something to pull your eye in each time at least in the the best performing ones right here you can see this one right here boom right in the center of the screen boom one key image that's going on right here so you see him eating this golden ice cream it makes you wonder what's going on you got him in this stack of stuff none of these images right there describe exactly what's happening in the video you need to look at that it's very important none of these describe what's happening in the video and so when you see people putting giant headlines and all these things in here these headlines aren't doing anything to create a question they aren't doing anything uh to create interest and the whole point of an image when you're using it on facebook or on youtube it doesn't matter is to create that interest to get a person to read the headline and then want to see what's happening next so check out some of my images on my youtube channel okay you can see like this one right here this video did very very very well why why don't why do my videos consistently do very well well because the images create interest you see you see me right here with bitcoin on my eyes saying oh my god creates interest what's going on here all right you can see a picture of me right here with sunglasses on i have a picture of ada the cryptocurrency and i have really bad above it what's going on here that's the point of the image is to get a person go what's going on it's not to convince the person to click or to sell to them okay and so when you're doing this on facebook it's extremely important then to have a very powerful benefit in the headline and the text because that's what you're going to get people to do okay let's look at a few of my image ads pay attention to this because this is super important when you're running video ads it's very important your thumbnail has these qualities okay that has these qualities you can see this right here this isn't particularly a great image a really good example of a great image on ads is going to be this one right here all right so you see me holding this little stick it's the same exact concept that you see in the beast videos the same exact concept you see in my youtube videos but what i'm going to try and do here on facebook ads is just slightly bit different as i always try to use a key focal point to draw people in this ad just absolutely dominates it's because of this thumbnail okay and so then the best way i find to make ads work on facebook because people aren't you're not you're not doing content all right you're not going to do something as interesting as burying yourself for an entire day right we're not doing cat videos here we need to get people to pay attention to the image by having the central point right here you can even see if we want to get down to the colors we have an extremely different color so if i want to make this image really stick out i would probably have my a white background me blurred out in an extreme focus on the thumbnail on the uh the thumb drive right here and make it a very very strong bright blue that would get the most interaction by far on the ad because the central point is right here and everything else is blurred out and not being no attention is being dragged from the eye to it so what i like to do is i don't want to have uh you don't ever want your headlines to be suggestive or broad if you're going to do them in your images what you want to have is a headline that creates a question or a challenge okay are tracking ai will scale your ads or you don't pay and that by the way that's the case at high risk literally if our ai tracking optimization does not scale your ads you don't pay okay and frankly with ios 14.5 out people's tracking not working accurately if you're running ads without high risk you're an insane person because you're not able to attribute correctly when you're not able to attribute correctly you can't scale as well you waste a ton of money and the ai optimization on facebook and google is a mess so you should check out hiros below if you get a chance we literally guarantee you'll see a 15 to 20 increase in your ads that being said you can see what i'm doing right here is i'm using this challenge to get the person to click because this is highly incentivizing to this is something they badly want look on youtube what a person badly wants is to be entertained all right and have their adhd influenced so that's why i'm not going and making challenges or or hooks or putting crazy things in the thumbnails because frankly when people are skimming through thumbnails on youtube we really need their eye to settle and then i use this right here i used it i used the challenge of entertainment why cardano will 10x and kill e this is this is a challenge it's the same exact thing okay so the reason why i put headlines in thumbnails on facebook is because in order to really lure in our target audience our target our target person we're not trying to get everyone to click this is the big important distinction on youtube i want everyone to click so i'm going to use something kind of broad and anonymous because i want as many views as i can possibly get okay our goal on facebook is to draw the person in with the image and then get our target prey to click with a very targeted challenge right so what i do right here is our tracking a will scale your ads or you don't pay this is a crazy challenge right here it's going to create a massive amount of interest for a very particular type of person okay but we don't want we don't want to take this broad approach that we use on youtube over to facebook so move faster build better what does that mean build a start a free trial because what's going to happen is when people see an ad what's they're going to do is they're going to notice it they're going to get their eye draw into it they're going to notice it's an ad so you better make some strong case because the only time a person will click an ad is they know they're not about to be entertained so you're not going to lure them in with some viral nova viral content ploy right there you might as well throw that out the window at that point we don't want everybody clicking we want to attract everyone's attention and then get a specific person to click okay because the best way to attract that specific person to click is to tap onto them like you can any other human being okay by using the same concepts that mr beast uses and his thumbnails that really popular youtubers use then once you have everyone's attention you want to sort out everybody by making a very clear benefit-driven challenge get started free is not a benefit-driven challenge give technologists a better way to build up skills is not a specific challenge this is not going to interest anybody and the cost per click and the people that you have coming through there's nothing that's being delivered here so what you want to do is you use this simplicity to draw on the eye you can maybe add something else that creates a little bit of interest then what we're going to do is we can add a very specific headline in the top right here to lay out the benefit that they're going to get especially when a video is playing and feeds you want to have this right here to remind people what the challenge and benefit of watching is and if you've drawn in your target audience using this method you then need to find a way to keep them and that's the way you do it with this challenge right here saying be the yoda of ads or get a free trial this is not going to lure and keep them okay the same exact thing goes with the headline the same exact thing goes with the text okay if you go and look at the text on my ads using p tracking and ai to optimize to get customer cheaper lets you scale yours let me show you the results it's just a straight up challenge these are the results you're going to see because the only reason people want to buy stuff they want to click as is results see tracking results how we hyper skill ads with data plus ai one thing i'm also doing right here is i'm not completely describing what we do as a company why because i need to create that interest to get the click the result is they're going to scale easier and make more money but i want to also be a little bit mysterious about how we get there i'm using again the same concept kind of as the beast videos or you see on my channel where i'm not completely explaining how we're going to do it but i'm explaining the result all right cardano will kill ethereum is the result that's what people are interested in but they want to know how it's going to work so if i say ethereum will kill eth because the scaling solutions are better it's going to fall apart because people know what the video is about if i just say it's going to kill it completely different thing okay so take these lessons to heart it's a very simple lesson that i have for you today that that's literally it if you can apply this you're going to see such better results with your ads your youtube videos literally anything you do that involves images and catching people's attention online now if you want more training like
