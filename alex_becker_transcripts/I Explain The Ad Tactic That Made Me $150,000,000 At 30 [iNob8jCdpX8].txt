so the Mind shet shift I'm going to give you in this video when it comes to your ads and your business is going to be the biggest breakthrough you've ever had I actually guarantee it you can come to my house leave a burning bag of gorilla poop at my doorstep we're not going to offer that this if this doesn't work for you please do not put poop on my doorstep but this took my business from zero to over $30 million per year primarily fueled by ads and before that I could never really break $10 million $12 million a year from the businesses and it's because I was running my ads in my business the wrong way and if you look at my business went from $0 to $30 million per year that creates by the way a $150 $200 million valuation business if you can do that and you can structure in the right business industry which I'll talk about in other videos you're set you're good if you've ever wanted to get inanely rich this is how you do it and it comes from this pivot of how you view ads and if you look at my ads and the things I'm doing I'm not doing anything else that other people are not doing if you look at my funnel for hyros for example it is a funnel to a sales page to a call Demo almost everybody watching this Channel online knows how these funnels works you see them you're going to get blasted with ads by people when you watch this video saying Hey I got this magic system to make money and they're going to send you to a funnel that's very similar to mine but mine makes way more money than all of them combined why how can I do this it's because of this little shift right here now I try to keep these videos short which is why at the end of this video I've linked to a video showing off the specific funnel that I'm using that I'm sending traffic into so you can get the base of that I'll even show you how I write the ads and the scripts behind them so you have that covered too as well as a video covering the entire monetization process that I use for this so everything that you might want to ask is at the end of this video link to other videos on this channel and like other channels that make all their money selling your courses I have nothing to sell you in these videos I've already made tons of money actually doing this the only thing I'm doing in these videos is adding you to a giant retarding list so it can convince you to use our software in the future but the content information I'm giving you my best stuff nothing held back because I don't make money selling information I make money by you doing better with your business and your ads and then upgrading and using our tools which make them even better so please drop your skepticism to zero it's not helping you here so what is this tweak I want you to listen very closely because this will change everything like I've stated you need to build businesses build your business around where you can advertise and what the market wants I know that sounds super basic but you need to understand what most people do they build a business first and then they try to advertise it instead you want to build the business around where you can advertise it and what advertising and demand in the market is easy to advertse high too so let's look at this very quickly because again this sounds like such a simple idea make what the market wants and make where it's easy to advertise it is but no one does this because the subtlety of the idea is completely missed upon them I want to lay out to you my mistakes to then outline how you're probably making these mistakes too if you're making a business that's below $20 million per year you're making this mistake okay unless you just like making less money but by all means ignore me but look let's look at two of my businesses I had a business selling information uh courses and I had a business selling email remarketing okay so let's look at both of these businesses for what they are so if we look in the info marketing space very hard to advertise because there's tons and tons of products very similar to it thus my marketing of it is just going to be a pain in the butt two the product is very hard to sell via ads I know people sell all these all the time they make tons of money doing it but when you actually look at it it's so damn hard to sell because you're selling thin air and there's a thousand other products in the market and then three it's extremely hard to sell because where can you really Place ads for this product on only on on videos online where people are trying to make money online and so that grossly limits where I can Market this to and who I can Market this too who's going to be buying these info products too if I really want to Market these few ads people without money because people that have money and have successful businesses are not going to be buying info products so much and then if I want to Market these to people that do have successful businesses it's just an entirely hard thing to pitch because the people that are actually successful sitting around watching YouTube they're hard to reach thus you you went into so many problems with this this is why you have to sell High ticket to make this work you have very limited places of where you can place your ads at the Market's overly competitive before I even turn on my first ad it's just incredibly hard to sell this product due to all these limitations right here no matter how good my marketing is no matter how good my ads are no matter how good my copywriting and sales pages and landing pages and how famous I make myself it's going to be pushing a boulder up Mount Everest to get this going we want when we start our ads and we start our business we wanted to be like pushing a boulder down down Mount Everest so everything around this product was just hard to sell now if we go look at for example I had a business Market hero which was an email autoresponder and again we're running into the same issues right here the entire Market is very low ticket okay so if you go look at like convert kit for example they're charging like $9 a month and so let's look at the situation here I'm trying to advertise the businesses which are the most expensive people to advertise to with a low ticket product in a market that's fiercely competitive there's thousands of other autoresponders out there this is this is advertising hell because I can't sell something High ticket to make money in my ads back I'm marketing to the most expensive people there are the marketing places I can place it at are very hard to reach and the best way to make money back on ads is to be able to go a little bit High ticket especially when you're doing B2B marketing you can't do this here so a lot of people go and they make businesses without thinking about the fight that they're getting in and they think they're going to out add it they think they're going to outsmart the ads and make the best advertising on planet Earth and that's going to be their key and so you have people spend years on their business working on the ads working on the ads working on what they're saying working on the sales Pages thinking that's where their goal and ticket is going to come from and it just simply is not so for example when I made hyos we were able to get this to $10 million a year very quickly and I've never broken more than a couple thousand A Day In AD spin at hyros but on these other businesses I was breaking 10 $20,000 a day sometimes because the businesses were set up for high effort low return and ads whereas hyos for example let's look at this what were all the fundamentals that went in the hyos working okay one low competition there is very few products in the market that can do what hyos did back then even now there's very few products in the market and they don't really advertise very well if I'm getting into the infom marketing space every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in that space is an advertising m Master every sales video every ad is built to the te to convert cuz these people cannot make money without being at the top of their game right here no okay so first thing we want to look at is low competitivity in the advertising space which is a lot of businesses as soon as you break out of info marketing or education or coaching or Consulting there's very little competition and advertising so we want to look at our product and say all right are the competitors advertising well no I can stand out now another thing that hus does not have but you should look for is how easy is it to advertise so for example I want to give you an example of what worked really well in e-commerce and supplements if you look at gfuel and all the um the gaming pre-workouts SL caffeine drinks if you noticed before those businesses took out no one was advertising to Gamers no one was advertising these energy drinks to Gamers and using influencers to do it and so if you look at this there's an entire part of the market Gamers not being marketed to that were accessible through influencers and noral advertising and then all they had to do is connect this product to this market and the advertising for this was extremely profit because no one else was doing it and so they're able to go and grab up this entire share of the ad Market that was completely wide open that's why the business was successful if you opened a pre-workout or energy supplement and you target the normal markets using the normal means you wouldn't have done well how many products like no explode were released in this time frame where instead what they did is they built the business around the market the advertising Market instead of building the business around what they wanted and then trying to Market it through the same venues this is the big shift now we also want to look at the Dynamics of the product I knew when I was making a software company having a low ticket software company wasn't going to work like a MailChimp or something why because it's so damn hard to make your money back on ads when you're selling low tickets you have to convert so highly whereas with hyos I said okay cool we can make this High ticket all right I can charge $ 35 dner dollars up front and so I want to make something like segment I want to make something like Heroku I want to something like Salesforce where it's very expensive upfront or can charge very expensive prices to high ticket customers and then I want to make sure the customer base was good who buys ad software people running ads who runs ads people that make money no one no one that doesn't have money isn't running ads if a person is broke they're not going to be running ads and so I'm marketing exclusively to people with money so let's look at all the things that were different with hyro so far competition in the ad space low ability to sell High ticket yes who am I selling to rich people and then combine the other traits of the business which I talked about the end of this video which is the LTV and the rebills and when I got into this I knew primarily how I was going to advertise this I knew exactly which vehicles would work really really well for this which were retargeting YouTube videos based around ads and so there's a lot of other things that go into this as far as the product goes but you need to start going and thinking about how to design your business around the traits that work well with ads and then the ad Market itself the ad market for pre-workouts extremely competitive impossible to reach the ad market for gamers wide open so what you do is instead of going and building a business that you want to build you say all right cool how can we tweak this business to take advantage of the markets that are wide open how can I build my offer and my product I'm selling to have the best traits that work with an ad how can I find the low competition markets and then design the product to work really well with it and by the way low competition markets with a high ticket product that is reoccurring and is being sold to rich people this is this this is what works goes nuts and this is why hyos my ad tracking business did infinitely better than my email responding business though the advertising behind the email autoresponder business was top tier Ninja level I had to like bend over backwards and jump through hoops full of fire and train a tiger just to get a sale there not the same at at at hyros and this little pivot right here is the difference between me having a software business it was doing you know $3 $4 million a year and a software business doing over $30 million a year this is the difference between having a Pre-K Workout Company uh that does no money and a pre-workout company just goes to the moon in the easiest advertising possible because no one's marketing to them this is how you have to structure your business and this is what will make your ads work and not work now at the end of this video like I pointed out right here here is a video on the funnels that I'm using the scripts that I'm using in the ads and even the long-term monetization strategy I haven't I don't know where these videos going to pop up but they're here they're on here somewhere so watch them you'll make more money okay bye
