================================================================================

if you want to scale and make more money from Facebook ads not having this makes you a clown so the title of this video unlike other videos is actually 100% accurate I've been making these AI ads that you're seeing right here on Facebook and they have been killing it this has cut our cost to get a call down nearly in half the cost to get a sail down nearly in half it is Shing money I'm very excited about it because what I'm going to show you in this video is my workflow to create these things and I if you do not know have a image generation company I was running I was a CEO of one and uh that's the side business I don't really talk about my other software companies here long story short I've been on The Cutting Edge of this for a while I've been using image generation on my computer training models and whatnot for a long time but it hasn't been good enough to use for ads consistently yet it hasn't been something that most people can put their hands on and get impact and change their entire ad Revenue business whatever with immediately and now it is I if you can't tell I'm a little bit excited here because what you're able to do with this stuff right here is shocking and it's shockingly easy for the first time to the point that anyone can do it I mean heck I've even successfully turned myself into a big boobed blonde I know some of you guys are into that it's really why you've been coming to this channel but I mean the the the possibilities here are endless and so what I'm going to show you right now is my exact flows for creating these types of video ads I'm going to make some image ad videos later on this week so you should subscribe to the channel and I'm going to show you my whole AI video training workflow here a little bit later on for ads but today I just want to show you a workflow for your ads that anybody can use and more so I want to show you how I'm using this with my ads to really drop the cost for everything and get calls and sales much cheaper by applying it to my existing ads you can just copy and paste this on what you're already doing and so what I'm going to do now is just show you my exact flow for that because on this channel I tell you everything I know for free because uh a I've already made a ton of money and two I don't have some Mastermind or or course that I want to sell you right now I simply just want you to maximize your ads make a sh ton of money and then when you make a of money you're probably going to want to track your ads accurately so you see your accurate data to scale with and so you don't burn and lose all your money which is when you're going to start using hyos my tracking company which literally everyone oning planet Earth uses that's a big name and you should too because if it doesn't grow your ad Roi on your ads you literally don't pay for it come check it out after this video it's wonderful but enough of that I'm not going to pitch you any more hyros at least for another 5 minutes we're going to get into this flow okay so I want to show you a super duper simple workflow um for this and it only takes a little bit of basic eding so if you have an editor um or you can I you could just literally train someone on your team to do this it isn't that hard if anyone on your team has ever worked with editing or you've ever worked with editing or you spend a whole fiveing minutes in 2025 to learn how to edit videos and dript or something like that it's not hard you can do this right here so let me walk you through how I made this video right here that's coming across the screen right now uh all the different angles all the the everything uh from start to finish all right so look we're in uh chat GPT right now maybe you've heard about it's a very small startup company uh I think I think they've they're making at least hundreds of dollars right now um I don't think they're going to be doing well in the future but who knows all right so what what we do here so first thing I did is I went and took a picture of myself you can see me here looking all old and flabby and uh don't tell anyone I'm aging but uh you just there you go take a picture of yourself I think you know to do that motherucker all right so then what I did it's very simple and I'm sure you've seen these Studio gibl things out of here and so I'm not here to teach you how to type in the uh chat GPT I'm here to teach you how to get the base for these videos because you can't just put this in here and it that makes a video so I'm going to walk you through this if you haven't seen the gibl stuff and you're living under a rock that's fine um but remake this image in studio gibl style and uh make in a hat and filming himself selfie style talking me so you see generates this picture right here okay um and so what I then did is I want to make a series of different videos from this so the first thing I did right here is I made this picture I made this picture and I converted myself into a girl right here because you know let's get freaky and weird with this I I if I don't have to hire actors for ads that's incredible I can just literally cosplay a hot blonde chick with big boobs and get people to buy my stuff from all over the Internet it's a dream come true that the singularity is awesome okay so the next thing we're going to do is we're going to come over to hedra okay so a lot of people are like oh look make Studio gibli things and when I saw I'm like okay screw making little memes for my family let's use this to just manipulate the people on the internet and get them to buy things so of course my mind just started turning majestically here so I immediately went and and started throwing this in here and now you have to understand AI editor I want to give you a lot of money image Generation stuff in the past but the whole thing that is unlocked here is the fact that chat GPD allows you to actually describe things and it accurately gets it right most of the time like if you're using stable diffusion on your computer or something like that which I use and we'll talk about that more when we get into the image ads um you're not really able to like say do this thing do this thing do this thing do this thing and like describe how the picture should look you have to use like lots of weird prompts and talk to it in like code and even then it's not going to come out correctly you can actually talk to it and make base images in chat gbt which is where this excels it's not really good at like doing face swaps or like specific things it's really good at giving you like your base image but that's about where it stops I don't think Sora is that good for making ad videos so that's where chat cppd kind of stops what is really good for making videos is head run I'm going to show you a few different layers here cuz the first thing you do is you just make a a image talk that's not where we're going to stop okay we're going to do a lot of more freaky stuff but you can do all sorts of stuff like for example in chat gbt convert yourself to a picture and then animated it's like so here's a picture of me in anime style um for my crypto stuff if you ever seen that it's terrible please don't ever watch it but you can do this you can go and anim animated photo but then what you can actually do is you can then upload a video of you speaking and you convert it to another Voice or just use your voice so for example um here's the initial video right here if you were on Facebook Google ads I applied this to 150 businesses Facebook so what I did is I just took one of my higher converting ads and I just I just took the audio from it and the video starts off with me talking into the video and I just took the audio and import it in here and so when we go down here we'll just go to uh create new video and then you'll add in the video you add in the let me make sure you can see this right here I'm just doing this all live because I'm lazy I'm not going to go and edit this after so you're just going to have to deal with that but you come right here and you're going to go and add a image and you're going to add a script and then you can go um upload the audio okay and I'm just going to go right here I'm just going to type in the script right here just whatever and you can choose a voice and make it play okay so just pick a person's voice press play and uh let's see what this actually says GFS so gibberish right there but anyways I'm going to show you the final result after we upload audio because I think this is all pretty self-explanatory once you see this I think you're going to get it so anyways the final thing is you can go and upload audio and it will be yourself talking it will make the image match your talking you can see right here I did it with another uh studio gibl if you want Facebook Google ads I applied this to 100 so that's pretty cool but that's everybody's going to be doing that you know you don't want to just stop there okay we can also convert ourself to a girl if you want Facebook Google ads I applied this to 150 businesses Facebook and Google ads that's great that one actually did the lowest conversions I was surprised by that is this anime one that did the best Okay so that's level one of course we can just go and take our ads or take little clips of these ads and do like maybe the first five second five 10 seconds like this that's what I was doing with my ads that worked really well I don't think that's going to work very well for a long period of time because everybody in their dog can do that we want to go to a level that other people cannot and so if you want to take this to the next level what you do is when you see which ad is converting or which character is converting the highest what you do is one I wanted to see if the the girl could do it so I made a bunch of different videos with the girl on here but the she didn't convert this highly as I thought I did so this guy right here he's the be's knees he just he just brings and apparently all the dudes that run ads they see that and they just get they just get their pants get tight all right and when I say Johnny goodlooking converts I mean we're here's some of the tests right here you can see in this one just from like the past day or so that we've been running these tests right here um we're getting sometimes on on normal hris ads we're getting 200 300 $400 price per call which is fine because of how our company Works we're getting $96 calls on this one and it's just crushing for us by the way you should be using hros tracking because I wouldn't be able to track literally any of this um Facebook ads caught four calls right here we had 13 calls just come in from this test so I mean I don't see how you're running your ads with half your data and not seeing where almost half your sales are coming from it's probably it's it's 100% losing you money you should come check out hyos after this and just plug it in because we guarantee you'll get better stats that you can then plug into your ad AI it will improve your targeting more and you get cheap clicks and make tons of money like we do but seriously though like we guarantee you'll get these results you should come and stop using this data because it's not accurate and run your ads with accurate data it tends to help the ads do better anyways back to the content so we're going to use Johnny goodls here which looks exactly like me we all know you don't have to tell me I know um so we're use Johnny goodls here AKA Alex Becker and what I then did is I took that original image and I said okay start generating pictures of him different angles so I'm thinking of all the different frames and stuff I want to use for videos now this is really quick and easy to do if I wanted to sit down for like a couple hours and do this I could make like a complex movie like video doing this this is to me just throwing sh at the wall uh I'm probably going to train someone on my team uh to build these type of videos and then they're going to spend all their time doing I don't have time to do this all day but if you're just getting started or whatever the potential is endless so I'm telling it to give multiple different pictures of me in different poses um can you create this character an image of this character but zoomed up and not close to his face in a way looking down at the view with big eyes keep uh the big color base everything format identical so it generates this picture right here and then I wanted to put in the clown face and I'm just telling it these prompts right here you can see like can you create an image of this character but zoomed up an noxiously close to his face uh put him in a clown makeup with the same expression please keep the color balance format the same voila you're going to you're going to prompting this isn't like prompting in stable diffusion or some other softwares it just translates to English you can just talk to it like it's a thing or a person person and they create these images so now what we're going to do my my friendly Pokémons is we're going to go and shoot new ads we're going to do little 5-second voice clips and so if we want to make an ad where it shifts between multiple different angles and faces here's what we're going to do so like the end result of this ad if you want to scale and make more money from Facebook ads not having this makes you a clown seriously we put this on 150 sites running Facebook 15 at least saw a 15% increase in ad wi let me repeat all 15 100% and all they had to do was paste this little line of code let me show you here's how this so you saw what I did right there and I'm going to break that down now okay I just wanted to show you kind of the end product so you understand what what we're we're trying to achieve here so obviously you see those multiple angles and everything going in you see the text and everything how do we do this so if you're smart you can probably already piece this together so what I do is I shoot 5-second audio clips and then what I do is I paste each one of these images in here so you see I start with the clown face and I put the audio in not tracking ads you are a clown okay so I did the one where I actually had my voice on it if you want to scale and make more money from Facebook okay and then what I do is I then I download that clip and I throw it into Camtasia and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to edit them together seriously we put this on 150 sites running face you see how that works pretty damn simple and all they had to do was paste this little line so you're going to make a new image and you want to keep the character consistent and you can make stuff so for like example I'm doing one with like this fat guy right now do you want your Facebook ads to make more money hi I'm Greg I buy media and I so that's s be like the beginning of the ad and you can just paste them all together now what I really suggest you doing I'm going to get into this more on my ad strategy is you don't want to make like entire ads about this you want to start the ads with like different characters see which one gets the best clicks and then what you want to do is maybe do like the first 15 20 seconds of your ad like that okay I'm going to get into the strategy a little bit in in the next videos here in a week or so so be sure to subscribe and so that's how you piece them all together and then with those the the the text and everything like that either send it to an Editor to do that for you are use one of the text generation AI apps that's on the internet been around forever and you can add the text and the overlays on top of it um with the effects and voila with that all being said we have these ads done ready for us and this took me about this is my first time doing this I have a bunch of other ones that are going up right now so they're even better than this one but this took me like 45 minutes and that's with trial and error I can get this process down to about 20 minutes and pump out one of these every single morning if I want uh don't even get me started on the image Generation stuff so this is the process and again the thing I would also suggest as well if you're going to do this you're going to see which ones are actually making you money when you're testing all these ads please I beg you track them with hyros you can see right here we are tracking literally seven times the calls as Facebook is catching right here I wouldn't be able to test these ads accurately if I was not using hyros tracking because we have all these funnels and stuff and sales that happen after that and I mean if you're just running your ads again without hyos you're Flying Blind and you're guessing what the your ads and I don't know why you're doing that cuz it's making you make so much more less money and you could just try hyros and we guarantee it will make you more money from your ads like you get an Roi we literally tracking double the calls because our tracking's improved so much over the years to like superb AI crazy level so you should use use hyros with this it'll make you a lot more money and I think that's what you're here for so what else do I want to yell at you right now as I bring this up so I have nothing else to yell at you about you should subscribe to this channel because I share lots of cool like I just did in this video and I'm G to be sharing even more AI ad stuff that you can use for your Facebook ads to um not pay artists and produce cheap crap that gets people to buy stuff from your internet so
