all right guys welcome to another training video you need to help so i'm here to help you so what we're going to work on right now is the broadcast i'm going to show you how to use this now like everything else in the system it's extremely simple but you can go very very deep with it so i'm going to show you uh how to do that so basic very basic email sending system right here from the get go you want to set your from name and your address is going to be coming from okay also be sure to check out the spf video that's provided in the original training area as well so with that being said how this works is almost the same exact way as the lead system okay so i can go right here and if i want to send just a basic email to everybody that has the tag source wave and that's how we segment our users we can do that now we can do a lot of other cool things with advanced settings just like in the leads area we can have it say all right we want everybody that has a tag source wave but does not have the tag alex becker okay so i don't want people from this list getting the same email so we can do that you can see how it reduces the amount of people on there so it subtracts 5000 people that have uh that specific tag and we can just go as deep as we want we can do anybody that has this tag uh for example we do anybody who has a sorcery tag but has bought uh this product right here add that right there and you can see you know it subtracts it from there so i can go and target people that haven't bought a proc i can target people that haven't seen a certain page target people that have been on the list for a certain amount of time it just goes on and on and on and on and on so i'm just gonna send a basic email right here and we're gonna go to email sequence so what you can do right here is you can create a new email you can use a template use template you can simply go right here you can see all the emails you previously sent you can select one of them and uh boom it's there you can go and edit the template change the uh the title the subject of the email the text the email it's all here for you to use pretty simple now um if you need any help other than this about the the the email builder it's very simple just drag and drop you can put your text right here you know write it all up and stuff like that you can go and change you can put an image right there you can go select your image just click it add the image to it um and you can do just about anything now if you want to control the styles how the email looks and everything we can go right here to change the overall uh style the email we can change it to whatever we want whatever we want to do and finally the last thing you might get confused with is the image you can go add an image right here i'm just going to go grab an image that we usually use let's just go and grab that image you see it loads up you can change the link right there if you want and they go and change the size of our image we go out here to block style and we just go like that so we can change it as much as we want we can change the padding around the image everything is super customizable as you can see we can change the body color of the the email it's all here okay anything you need in an email center to send simple emails is there and if you want to make it beautiful and pretty and stuff there's all the tools you need to do that as well you can add bigger images and whatever you need to do okay fairly simple so i'm going to cancel not going to save that um and that's really all there is to it we can create a new email it's essentially the same exact thing just make sure you have your unsubscribe uh your abuse link right here and your address you can go and actually add these by going right here and going to links and you can go and add any of these things right here you can add them in any way you want i like this this comes loaded in every template because it's very subtle and very low there but i know some people want to custom unsubscribe and review spine now you need to understand also with the report abuse button the cool thing about this is it's not going to count as a complaint against your account we will simply see it and see that somebody's complaining but this prevents people from actually complaining and damaging your account so keep that in mind now that's how that all works this is how the email center works at this point in time all we do is click send after naming the broadcast so we can find it in stats later and that's all there is to it it's very simple now let's imagine right here i want to go and i want to see the stats on the broadcast i since just sent so in guard here we can view stats and i'll just look at this email right here okay you can see the stats everybody opened i can see exactly how much this email generated me what people bought everything like that and i can go through and see who clicked this email make a segment for that i can go back and see who complained i can go back and see exactly how much i earned per click per open uh per everything and i wasn't even pitching anything this email so that's really cool it shows like hey if i send like value content out people still are like buying stuff through that so i can go right here maybe i want to mail the unopened people uh move around and this just gives me more ways to segment my list and mail people and talk and have different conversations with the type of customers that i've had based on the behavior that they've interacted with me with that's a lot of big words but i can basically talk to people based on what they've done and have a real conversation with them instead of sending everybody the exact same thing that's really the coolest thing on top of the ltv tracking instead of market hero i think so if you have any more questions be sure to hit up our super handy support right here they'll be able to answer everything for you and that's how the broadcast system works it's really simple really easy to use um again just recap it real quick to send you broadcast you just click new broadcast if you want to see your stats or what's going on with your broadcast right now i just click here and you can see the stats names everything like that so fairly simple that's all there is to it and i'll catch you in the next training
