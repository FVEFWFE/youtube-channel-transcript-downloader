[Music] okay guys you read that title right and I'm not just gonna drop $25,000 on the keyword money on my ads no no no no no no that's that's baby stuff I just wanted to set the bar a little low for you simpletons but now that I've got you where I want you we're gonna be spending about $500,000 on the keyword money in this video look jokes aside last year we were able to break eight figures and sales mostly from running YouTube ads and one of the craziest audiences that got the best results which is bidding on crazy simple little keywords like the keyword money but that's it just that's it that's the entire ad audience I'm not kidding just the keyword money I'm also gonna show you other audiences which delivered huge results that kind of break this rule that use like two key words make money it doesn't get any simpler than this and I'll even show you the ads that I ran they're comically easy you see people saying I'll show you to make money on your iPhone no screw that all you need is a PowerPoint presentation for this I'm not joking and let's back up okay this does take some ad experience I have a lot of experience running ads but if you're beginner this is gonna kind of show you what running ads at a high scale looks like and if you're a veteran this is gonna help you stop the super over complication that's in the industry right now I go into all these ad groups or these Facebook groups and their strategy is being shared or ridiculous it's like all right first thing you got to do is do a handstand and make sure it's raining outside and you got to do six prayers to Mark Zuckerberg and then you're gonna layer 15 audiences and make sure that it only displays on this net what the what the are you doing just just do this let me show you so here's what to do first things first go and smash that like button look if you appreciate these type of videos it would super help me out if you hit the like button because it helps with algorithm and that's how I'm gonna say just take a second click it all right let's get back to it okay guys so we're inside my AdWords account right now and I want to show you this because it's hilarious and I want to show you to do it because if you understand how it works it's just way easier to run ads so you can see I've set it to January 2019 to today right here I'm gonna go back through our ad campaigns now you can see right here we spent about three million bucks on this one account right here and the conversion value reported back is about six million dollars usually if you've seen any of my wonderful tracking ads that I'm running right now for high rose you're gonna know that AdWords usual only catches about forty to fifty percent of sales for this type of funnel so it's a little bit higher than that I'm actually significantly higher than that but we can just work with this a3x ROI ish to X ROI that that's still just Danny so low scale high-skill whatever you want to accept we can go from there now what I want to show you are these three audiences right here pure money make money and MMO intent these are the most simplest targeting's you could ever imagine and you can see right here about a hundred seventy-six thousand spent hundred twenty one thousand spent and sixty thousand spent right here this is the most beginner level anyone can do this targeting effort now I'm not suggesting in any way if you're complete beginner you're gonna replicate this or get these results this is not a way to make money in your basement I'm very good at running ads I'm very good at running ads I'm just showing you this for gee-whiz information for beginner I have no courses sell you so don't so don't come in here and think I'm gonna sell you some magic way to make money through YouTube ads you won't make money you won't be able to do this but you will learn and see what it looks like in a larger scale if you're a veteran maybe you should just take away that it can be much simpler than just probably doing right now so that being said if we go look at these audiences right here I want to show you first off just the audience okay so this audience that I'm running right here is a very very simple keyword audience you can see I just put in the keyword make money online okay and I think this one right here where's conversion value on this one see this one right here actually did really well as well it did 5,000 and cost at $10,000 back usually should increase it by about thirty percent right here so probably did about fifteen thousand dollars back and so the first thing I want to show you in this video is just how simple the targeting be I just targeted this keyword and did substantial amount of money from this and I target many other keywords just like this and this is one of the big components of how we did millions and millions of dollars worth of sales now I don't run these ads anymore cuz I really I don't want to be in the make money online niche I don't want to be tylo PEZ I want to build a software company and build type of businesses so I actually left this business and turned it over to my partners but just a really good example of how simple you're targeting and be regardless of what business you're getting into so this right here just targeting big huge broad keywords works exceptionally well with your ads and I want to show you the funniest thing about this one of the best performing ads so one of the ads it did best over time and it's going to show 0 over here because I destroyed the conversions to use offline conversions as I plug in the Jairo so that data got lost right there which is fine because I'm not running these ads anymore but one of the best performing ads right here was you've probably seen that this wolf mug ad and is literally just me filming me playing with a wolf mug just that it's just a video of me moving around a wolf mug talking about the wolf mug and how people can build Shopify businesses and whatnot and the one I wanted to really show you guys to just show you how simple it can be to advertise is this ad right here I'm only going to show you just the beginning of it but if we go look this I'm sure you might have seen this ad if you give me 39 seconds I'm gonna show you how this guy right here whoever generated where someone says if you give me this amount of seconds so you can see here this ad has about 5 million views on it and this is just literally a PowerPoint presentation of me cracking jokes about Arby's melts so this is why it blows my mind when I go in ad groups I see people doing these really professional videos and talking about these complicated targeting strategies the real key to running ads in my opinion is the message and knowing what the customer wants and then and then making a funnel on an ad that is so damn efficient that you can use it on big giant keywords for example another audiences that's super super well for us another ad group and just imagine those two ads those two ads generated millions of dollars in sales by themselves ok so you could go out there and legitimately if you want to go and maybe make a six-figure business or grow your business a little bit you really don't have to make any more ads or get more complicated than this now the next thing I want to show you that works really well is intent audiences because what you can do right here on AdWords is you can create these intent audiences does this allow you to go and target very basic keywords and in going target people that have been looking for these keywords recently this works really really well for me at high roast right now so you can see right here I just put an earn money online how to make money online and how to make money and the way I got those keywords is just by simply going over here to the keyword planner and one of the easiest ways you can go and create intent audiences just by going in here and I'm just gonna type in the keyword you know how to make money throw that in and you can see a list of keywords you can use to make intent audiences so one of the best ways I got results with our campaigns was just using really super basic intent audience you can see one of our also best performing keywords again was just me going and putting in Shopify and dropshipping as an intent audience you can see right here hundred thousand in probably about four hundred thousand dollars out when you account for AdWords missive attribution and the other thing I wanted to show you is if you look at our basic audiences right here all these are one word audiences so online jobs intent I just put an online jobs because obviously people that want to work an online job they probably want to go and start a business online or something like that so that right there you can see we put about 83,000 and probably did 150,000 to 200,000 back accounting for the attribution and so you're gonna notice that all my audiences that did best if we look at the cost of all the conversions this is a mountain it cost me to actually get a lead into my business they're all the most basic audiences that I'm targeting in Adwords and so if you're starting a business are you starting to advertise what I want to show you in this video is simply this the key to going in advertising online the key to going and building your business online or getting more customers isn't in complication it isn't and going and making some insane ad targeting that no one else can replicate and no one else knows about what I just showed you there anybody can do if you have access to a PowerPoint in a cell phone and the ability to type in whatever your business is the keyword is for example at high risk one of my main keywords is tracking because we sell tracking software see how that worked and that's because the secret to your ads is not your ads I'll repeat the secret to making a lot of money with ads is not ads if you go on any Facebook group you go on any marketing discussion it is people racking their brain and getting super complicated and when you look at people who are Facebook ad gurus or YouTube ad gurus what they do is they complicate and they complicate and they complicate it's ridiculous anybody can go out there and do what I just did a chimpanzee could go out there and do what I just did the thing that people can't replicate is going to be the message of the ads the funnel itself and the amount of time and effort goes into optimizing the funnel and the angle of the offer now h com only had these two strings what I just showed you now I'm no longer a part of that business cuz I really don't like to make money online niche I don't like selling I don't want to sell courses to beginners I just don't want to do that anymore I like working on my software company seriously only work with existing successful businesses now so if you're beginner don't buy any courses I will give you literally everything you need to know for free all the ads everything you need to know to get started it's all it's all my youtube channel there's links below to all sorts of trains they're all over my youtube should check them out don't buy a course just you don't need it that being said that funnel right there there's so many people if you go the YouTube right now and you type in shop fight hundreds of people trying to sell you a Shopify course everyone their dog wants you to start a Shopify store why was our funnel why were our ads able to be so successful and so many people struggle it's because of the hyper optimization and the funnel it's because of the hyper optimization of the marketing message because the hyper optimization of the copywriting and so what you need to take away from this video is if you want to start a business right now the angle part is actually the most important part at high roast right now our ads generate far more profit than those ads ever did far more profit ROI wise they're not scaled up to that level yet but the reason they are able to do that is because the offer is angled so much better it's such a more desired product and it's an offer that people can't really replicate it's gonna cost you a lot of money and almost a year and a half a development to make something like that and so that allows us to have a blue ocean all to ourselves and so you should pursue that first but then the second key is going to be the hyper optimization of your funnel and the copywriting and then of course the product after if you don't have a good product and people don't get results with your product they're not gonna buy your other products they're gonna refund it's gonna be a disaster so you need to make sure your Prok is top of the market as well and if you can do those things that's where your success with ads will come from so when you're scrolling around watching videos about training and advertising don't buy in to the complication the complication should not be in the ads it should be on the other side
