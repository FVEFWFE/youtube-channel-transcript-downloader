================================================================================

point blank if you apply what i show you in this video to your landing pages you're going to see much higher conversions just period i'm going to walk you through some of my highest converting pages and some of the highest converting pages of all time that i've ever seen from youtube ads from facebook ads and i'm going to show you the micro optimizations and the big optimizations that i know other people have made and i have made and that for example people in my ad mastermind we have the best youtube ad results of any ad mastermind on planet earth i'm not telling you that to get you to join the mastermind i'm telling you that because i consistently show hundreds of people in this mastermind this exact strategy this exact landing page design and it just every single time improves their conversions so it works it's easy to do and i'm just going to show you this in this video if you want to know why i'm showing this my name is alex becker i'm the ceo of hyrus it's the fastest growing ad analyst company in the entire world i've also generated 10 plus million dollars in sales from facebook ads and over 20 million dollars in sales from youtube ads and i tell you exactly how i did that and how i've helped other people do it so as you will grow your business to a point with ads that you need proper attribution which is what hirose does if you just use proper attribution you're gonna see much much much higher rois on your ads and you're gonna save way way more money we actually guarantee that and we actually guarantee that and deliver that every single time which is why pretty much everybody uses hi-ros these days that being said i want to show you this so you can grow your ad account first so that maybe you come back around and use hiros in the future so let's just hop into it okay guys so let's talk about this by reviewing two of my most successful landing page styles of all time so what i see people try and do in their landing pages and i'm just going to give you about three or four tips you apply these you can do so much better tip number one stop trying to communicate so many different things okay so you can see in this one right here youtube ad template i've used to generate over 18 million dollars in sales get my copy and paste ad scripts and targeting swipe files you see how simple this is to comprehend what i see happen all the time with people in their landing pages is they try to convey like my ten step formula to help me move out of my parents house and finally achieve a financial freedom by xyz by using a secret amazon style thing get get your free bonus and template okay what you need to do is you want to focus on only using words in as few words as possible while still being extremely impactful without distracting the human mind in too many different directions and you want to communicate something very very simple in every page the results you're looking for in a repeatable easy way and then that's it okay without effort the results you're looking for without effort you can take anything else from anything it's that youtube ad template i've used to sales what does template can convey easy repeatable what is it that they want the result they're looking for money from youtube ads get my copy and paste ad scripts and targeting swipe files this again conveys without effort copy and paste without saying it this is extremely important on any type of opt-in or call booking page okay look how simple this page is right here and there's not much else being communicated why because what do we need to communicate let's just remove the the rest of this page right here okay because you're gonna see there's literally not much communicated right here okay but again it's communicating the same thing what are we communicating right here we don't need to communicate too much if a person wants this right here they're going to opt in for it and a little tip and give you an opt-in pages is find a way to hook in without effort and easy into something that they can download or copy or or obtain okay if you just offer that simply right there people are going to do it and you and if you focus on being very simple keeping everything else basic it's going to work that's why on opt-in pages that's why on my landing page designs whenever i link a page to an ad to a page i keep it abysmally simple that's why when you go to like apple's website you're going to see something very similar to my designs right here because i copied apple okay how highros uses ai tracking to instantly increase ad roi and really this page this video is going to mostly just be about headlines look how high-risk uses ai tracking increase at roi how you can get a higher ad roi without doing anything that's what gets them to watch the video that's it or you don't pay okay so this is this is basically saying you're going to get everything you want without any effort or you don't pay for it this is a this is a just look how simple the communication is i'm not using a lot of words i'm not explaining a lot because the point of headlines is to get people to read the rest of the pages to get people to take an action it's not to explain everything that's happening okay that's a huge thing you need to do on your landing page understand headlines are meant to get a person to take action and take interest in the rest of the page not explain everything that's going to be happening people try to do too much in every section instead of letting sections do their own thing okay so i'm not really going to talk about the sales video because if you actually go in this video there's an exact walk through step by step of how this sales video works the sales video converts like crazy and you get walked completely through it for free on our hirose blog or on our hirose channel right now so you should really subscribe to it and if you need help writing these things and whatnot check out my ad mastermind below we have more results than any other ad mastermind on planet earth you should check it out it works pretty well so look i want to also show you what's going on in this page right here when you're writing pages what a lot of people try to do is they try to follow just some template and marketing script because that's what makes sense but the most important thing i'm going to tell you on any page or any funnel that you make is focus on context of who you're talking to and what they're thinking when they land on the page of course copywriting tactics have their place but more so thinking what is a person going to think when they land on the page this is the best copywriting tactic it's worked very well for me i've done very well with ads so it at least works somewhat i will tell you that and what i do when a person lands on the page is i think what is the person going to do in the land of page they're going to come here and they're gonna we need to hook them with this so i gotta hook them then i gotta get them to watch this video but they're probably not gonna watch this video or like 50 of them won't watch this video okay so what am i going to do next well i'm just going to say if you're short or they're going to watch very little of it so what if people watch very little of it well they're going to get hit in the first two minutes with all the benefits of hyrus and all the excessive proof that we increase people's ad rois by 20 30 percent literally every time we guarantee it you should use it it's silly if you don't that being said i predicted people are going to only watch two to three minutes of the video so i assume they're just going to scroll down and say look if you're short on time do this now what people are going to do on this page also is they're going to skim through or they're gonna watch two minutes of this video and then they're gonna just pop up questions so what i do is i answer the questions i think they're gonna have right off the bat what is print tracking okay boom okay and then i explain it in very very simple terms i never use any complicated terms i never use a lot of text anywhere why have you seen how people use the internet people don't read anymore they just simply don't they read big chunks of words okay so i use big chunks of words and pictures in my copywriting now another thing i'm gonna tell you is look at how simple this page is a lot of people have graphics and griffins and wizards flying around their page i could do that if i wanted i have the designers to do it i could draw a raven you know fighting a unicorn with with cyborg implants if i wanted on this page but i don't for a spare specific reason i want to be communicated very simply i use black backgrounds white text or i would use white backgrounds and black text and you can see i'm not using tons of colors and i'm just using red to stand out in key places okay just to give it a little bit of flair so it's not super boring to look at why am i doing this because i don't want complication i want simplicity at all points of the page so that my message is communicated in an understandable way too many people try to have way too much going on in their pages i'm not going to review pages but you can go to any sas company page you go to anyone there's just so much text and so much information to digest people don't you're you only have probably 20 of a person's attention when they're looking their page they got they got their cryptocurrency prices in upper right-hand corner they got their facebook thing dinging off they got telegram pinging them you only have you have very little of the human brain okay so if you're going to try and communicate with them in a deep way it's just not going to happen that's when that's the job of the sales videos that's a job of your webinars that's the job of your sales calls teams okay what we're trying to do right here is just get the bare enough attention to make the person uh just understand we're gonna get them these results and then give them the book a call that's that's all we're trying to do okay so what does this page really show you're going to get the results without effort here's what it is here's why it works here's all the results it's gotten you want to book a call do you want to book a call do you want to book a call and most people are going to book a call at this point right here now of course when we're doing like a webinar funnel or a longer sales video you know we're going to have to rely on the sales video to do a lot more of the heavy lifting this is why you don't necessarily want giant pages of text when you're not going for something that's really easy like a phone call you usually just want just a sales video and then all the the rest of the hoop plot comes out that's what a webinar is for that's what a longer form video is for okay one other final thing i'm going to show you that just works really well is what i like to call the endless conga line of i'm just giving you random land and landing page tips in this video if you haven't figured out yet there's really no objective with this video i just sat down like what do people want what's going to help them landing page tips look one tag that i've used forever is called the conga line of results if back in the day when i used to launch procs on war for a forum and i was the general piece of uh just kidding i love you war reform people you're great um but look back in the day when i used to launch procs like like a goofball on forums one thing that was super powerful was just posting an endless scrollable line of results and so you're going to notice on almost every sales page i have i line up results in a way so that people have to scroll past them why because people don't read results they don't read results they they but they take in how much they're scrolling one thing you can do when you're showing results is you don't necessarily want your landing page to be too long in my opinion people just aren't going to read all that it just they just really aren't what you want to do is you want to make them feel like the results are endless which i mean at high risk they pretty much are so this is easy for us to do but you want them to make them feel like the results are endless so they just go i'm not going to read all that this thing obviously works that's another really really really useful landing page tool you can use and then when you're showing testimonials results specifically long-winded results take the gist of what the people are saying and put those next to the results okay that's going to help a lot because people aren't going to read this they aren't going to read this this is just proof that what is right here is true so if they want to go prove it they can but most people aren't going to read this okay most people aren't going to read this stuff right here and then finally the last thing i'm going to show you is when people click away from your pages to the thing you want them to do keep it hyper simple you can see when they click this page right here they can't scroll down if they want but it's just pow pow like this is this is the only thing they can do right here there is nothing else there's no other there's no other pages for them to click to there's no terms of service there i mean it's at the bottom of the page of course there's nowhere else from the go same thing with this page right here right this is what i link ads to okay and this is why i keep this page so insanely simple there's nowhere for them to go there's nowhere for them to get lost on this page okay i see people they have like their whole entire website blinks up here like person a person be like oh yeah i do want to know about this guy or like hey i do want to like uh see pricing and whatnot no when you have a funnel there should be no escape from the funnel okay except the place you want them to go there's nowhere for you to go on this except here and there's nowhere for you to go on this page except here okay and uh those are the tips i'm going to give you for the day if you guys want more tips leave some questions in the
