hirolians it is becker and i have another ad training for you surprise surprise not really a surprise i've released these like once a week and send them to here it is i'm going to show you my facebook ads that are generating millions of dollars in sales at a significant roi for example on some of our high res funnels we're able to go out there and spend let's say three thousand dollars a day and routinely do fifteen twenty and sometimes even close to thirty thousand dollars a day in sales i wanna show you these funnels and i wanna show you how i started them up and how i also run them for my other business iron which is just a coaching program that helps people run their ads but i'm not pitching the coaching program here i just want to show you how i run the ads there as well so you can kind of compare it to your business because if you're looking at high roast or using house you're probably selling info marketing or e-commerce this will help you you might again be wondering alex why are you telling me this what's the catch there is no catch i want you to make more money from your ads so that you'll then think to yourself i want to make even more money for my ads so i'm going to track them using hiros which is the best in the world at that then when you combine this information with iris you're going to make even more money and upgrade your hires account so it's in my best interest to just tell you everything i know about running ads so let's get into my facebook ads and i'll show you how these work all right guys so since we're on the topic of facebook ads i'm just going to dive straight into my facebook ad manager so let's talk about how we scale facebook ads and what strategies have been the most successful for me particularly for a call funnel or something where i'm selling high ticket though this applies to virtually anything i want to start something off very clearly at the very beginning of this and that's this i don't like to hit you guys over the head with pitches for hiros and these trainings i'm just going to show you one of the most important things to me scaling is that i can clearly see my actual ad results right here using the chrome extension from hirose again i'm not trying to do a pitch right here it's just i don't see how i can run ads without this because you can see i have seven calls from this one ad right here facebook missed all of them and you can see that it gave itself 12 calls right here when it only had seven it gave itself two when it had uh only one right here and so again it's not even going to track the sales on webinars or sales call funnels whatsoever which you can see i'm able to track very easily right here that's just because of how facebook works and i'm not saying their tracking is super bad but when you have google ads running when you have facebook ads running when you have multiple layers of campaigns running at the same exact time when you have multiple facebook ad accounts you're going to get so much crisscrossing reporting especially when you factor in the fact that facebook will go and generate a lot of its reporting based on duplicate people viewing a page or a person reloading a page a few times and that just becomes insanely important because of this you can see i actually just got this chrome extension up about a week ago but if i go look at my ads from last month you can see i turn off many ads that were actually generating me a profit okay look at this one right here mass amount of profit coming in mass amount of profit coming in mass amount of profit coming in mass amount of profit coming in and two of these profitable ads right here this one was actually turned off so i'm going to be turning that one back on so first and more foremost rule number one use the actual data that you have i don't know how you can track it without iris but i mean maybe you can figure out some other system and then rule number two scale based on profit scale based on profit if you're scaling based on cost per call you can see this one right here had a really bad cost per call very profitable very very very profitable so if you're scaling based around your opt-in rates your call rates or some other data one don't scale around that scale bound profitability two if you are scaling around cost per call verify the calls coming in especially if you have multiple other traffic sources especially if you have multiple other traffic sources because facebook loves to give itself credit for virtually everything else you're doing on those other traffic sources when that's just not the case a lot of the time if you're scaling off something else you're scaling off faulted data it's just that simple so let me kind of show you how my strategy works and i'm going to show you this by showing you my best ads and really the psychology behind them if you nail this you're going to do very well with facebook ads i guarantee this will almost improve your roi on your ads immediately why can i say that because the insights i'm going to give you are insights that very few people i network with a lot of top youtubers people that have five million and tens of millions of subscribers it's one of the benefits that comes with my channel and the insights i'm going to give you are insights that most people don't have because most people that run ads don't run a youtube channel and if you look at youtube thumbnails and you look at youtube headlines you have the absolute key to creating great facebook ads also if you look at the native content that's on facebook and you mix it in with what's going on on youtube you're going to understand what people look at what they click and how they behave so there's three types of ads that do exceptionally well on facebook and instagram these are going to be the infographic style ads that you always see running around these are ads where you have infographics running okay that's what people watch when they're on facebook and and instagram image ads constructed in a very specific way and cell phone ads where you're talking in front of a cell phone let me explain these one by one so the first thing i want to explain is actually how i form my text and my headlines you can see this is very important on facebook because most people don't do this check out this line of text right here you can see how it ends at the c-more line right here this is where it ends on the mobile phone which is where most of your ads are going to be seen at so it's very important that you make your big benefit before that in terms of ad ry this line of javascript has been my unfair advantage for years i pay 30 to 50 less for my customers than my competitors okay you can see dan mai so the big enticing benefit is before the seymour next the headline you again want to make sure that it's not cut off you want to make sure the headline's not cut off this is basic stuff and here's where it gets more a lot more advanced when you're forming your text and when you're forming your headline there are a few things you want to keep in mind one you never tell the person what they're going to gain when they click the ad what do i mean by that the biggest mistake i see on youtube and facebook is people say let's use this as an example hey i'm going to teach you to make more money from your shopify store how to make money on shopify what happens when people see that every single shopify ad they've ever seen and every single experience they've had with a make money online is now put onto your ad this is bad if a person can guess what they're going to see they're not they're not enticed for example if you've already seen i ask you if you want to see do you want to go see return of the jedi you're going to say no i've already seen that i know what that's about there's no mystery the feedback loop has been completed so what you do instead with your text and your ads is you never tell them what they're going to see you tell them the big benefit and you create mystery around it in terms of ad ry for example at high risk i'm selling ad tracking in terms of ad right this line of javascript has been my unfair advantage for years i paid 30 to 50 less for my customers mystery i didn't say anything about tracking aa print tracking is like jet fuel for social ads what the hell is ai print tracking okay well first off at hiros we do use ai to scale ads and we do use print tracking it's called fingerprint tracking it's a very unknown type of tracking that most people aren't aware of that's why our tracking is so much more accurate because we're able to fingerprint people's devices and whatnot however most people don't know that so the the theory that i laid out in front of you before i talked about this still rings true so you can see i've never i haven't told the person what they're going to get but i've created a lot of mystery that hooks a person that's interested in paying less for their customers and wants to be on the cutting edge of ad optimization which is the benefit that we actually sell at high risk the ability to make more money from your ads so what you want to do is if let's say you're selling a shopify course how to make more money or how to teach a beginner how to make money on shopify for example or anything that you're selling i'm just using as an example i would not say hey click here and we'll show you to make money on shopify person is going to say i've seen that movie before i know i know exactly what i'm going to see right here the feedback loops already been completed i'm going to say something like the import strategy 711 used to make a 5 000 markup that i'm now using to make an extra 500 a day what is that going to attract it's going to attract a person that wants to make more money and is enticed by this new opportunity that's how you get a person to click an ad and then come on to the next page that's how you get people who are your target market through while not saying exactly what you're doing you never want to put something in front of someone that explains exactly what they're going to get you want to put massive benefit and mystery so there's fear of missing out so next what you want to do is on all of your ads it's extremely important that the first thumbnail has only one focal point why well if you go look at my youtube well if you go look at my youtube channel if you look at videos where there's a lot going on look at this one how to spot a bad biz group there's like tons of faces going on here the sleep pack that saved my life there's like this confusing thing right here the diet increased my iq by 10 points only 45 000 views then you look at this one right here it's just my face and brain looking turd thing nothing explained whatsoever if you want to understand click-through rates look at this while never play video games again after learning if you were making an ad right now like most people on facebook they make a video that says why video games are bad for you in the thumbnail and put them like playing a video game or something like that and they put something like video games lower your attention span no one will click that however you can see videos like this one graham steven ruined everything the entire background is phased out the lamborghini is highlighted graham is highlighted there's only one thing for the eye to folk focal on right here i don't know if that's the right way to describe but there's only one place for the eye to rest person scrolling through boom i rest right here and you want their eye to rest on something that creates intrigue they want to go what what the heck just happened here then there's a headline that incites them now on youtube this is a little bit more difficult to do because you're inciting people by guessing what's going to catch their attention with ads you know what's going to catch the person's attention you're hunting for a very specific type of person okay check out this ad right here this is an example of a usual facebook ad one million a month youtube ad scripts my eight figure youtube ad script 21 000 views no one watches it i put a video like this one never buy this just me sitting in a corner i spent millions on garbage 189k views you never want to tell them what they're going to get you want to focus their eye on something and drag them in now with video ads it's super important that you then once their eye gets locked in you have a headline of the main benefit they're going to get and then you have the text right here this is what most people are going to watch most people are not going to listen most people are not going to listen unless you really give them a reason to listen and that's pretty hard to do consistently so you need to imagine the person's watching this and they're viewing this silently and so you can see a person can really get what's going on in the ad and the text underneath it from the text that's going on in the video ad that's why infographic ads work so well in my opinion because what people love to see if you've ever been scrolling through facebook a lot of times you don't turn on the the sound on the videos you watch but you will go and watch those damn infographic ads that have text underneath them and have like cool graphics that change every three to five seconds that's how you make your case and you copyright to somebody because people aren't going to read this c more very often either okay they're going to watch this right here especially if you have a video okay so you want to use these infographic style ads because this is what people get hooked to constantly changing if it's you just walk around sitting in front of a desk it looks like an ad it's boring they've seen that movie before next the next type of ad it works very well for me now that we understand the principles between the headline and the text same exact principles for the text and headlines so i'm not going to cover it again same youtubey kind of image right here if i did this again i would actually blur out the background just put me right here and just even empty your room why what the heck is going on here i'm staying in a room that's completely empty and a tank top looking like i'm going to teach a dance class you can see that interaction right here people just freaking out this image hooks them it hooks them what's going on here then the person comes through here and because i'm targeting my target market with the targeting they're going to read the text in the headline and be intrigued and then click when you're doing your image ads you want to have only one focal point in the ads if you have a bunch of things going on or it's like you sitting on the beach it's so stupid that's that you the the point with an image ad is to hook the eye to hook the eye and create a question hook the eye and create a question hook the eye and create a question or you use a bold statement in the ad to create a question you can see what worked really well right here do this through three hours or die poor and in my face with extreme emotion the next type of image ad that works very well is a big bold mysterious statement and extreme emotional expressions and you'll see this a ton in my retargeting ads it's absolutely key to my retargets here's me about to cry giving this up killed me but i had to killed it 129k views no yes you see this big you see a very simple image right here there's nothing else going on here no yes people what you you can't go and just put like yourself standing the beach it has to be something that creates a question when they look at the ad so those are the two ways you can do it with image ads you'll see a lot of my retargeting the final type of ad that i find it works really well is what are people watching when they're on instagram and facebook they're watching they're watching phone ads and by phone ads what i mean is they're watching phone videos when you're scrolling to instagram you're gonna look at three different things you're going to look at those damn infographic videos you're going to look at pictures of people and the pictures that do the best the single focal ones that have a question with them make people go what's going on here and then third third you're going to be watching people talking on their phones that's the type of content that's on the internet that's the ticktacky-like content that's all over the internet so what you want to do is you want to have this right here because people don't go and see the sponsored thing going on right here but they see a phone ad and that's going to get you the chance to at least have their attention and you won't have the text underneath it same exact thing you want to hook them with the phone app i was going to do this ad again i'd actually put a headline right here as well or if you can look at other phone videos out there you won't want to look like an ad headline you want to put something almost look like a news headline or whatnot underneath here and that works very well as well these three types of ads kill it you want to use these for cold ads when you're doing retargeting ads here's what i found also killed you want to create that type of thumbnail that i discussed on youtube extreme emotion and a bold statement that creates a question person scrolling through right here they see this pissed off expression this provocative statement and then i really make the case in the text and you can see right here the goal of retargeting ads is not to sell somebody again it's to get someone to come back and if you want somebody to come back you want to do the same exact thing that you would do on youtube you hook them you hook them you get their attention and then you basically make a big benefit call to action you use the image to hook them and you make it very clear what they're going to get right here okay because the mystery mystery's over they already know what your ads are about they've already been sold to before so you just want to go for the big benefit and the best way to get them to pay attention the big benefit is with a very strong emotional face because that's what people respond to and a provocative statement using p tracking plus ai to optimize ads gets customers cheaper and lets you scale easier so again i'm using a bit of mystery right here thermo fear of missing out and again how we hyper scale ads with data plus ai i never say i never ever say better way to track your facebook ads or how to do your sales attribution better people don't want to see that they want to see this mysterious thing they don't quite understand what it is but they know what's going to get them a result it's provocative like that like that funny vocal track if you've heard that before from will ferrell that's what you want to do that absolutely works another thing that works really well is using memes or pictures for movies that hooks people's attention because they always they're used to stopping for that content so use a powerful emotional expression provocative statement make a very clear benefit-driven statement in your headline and your text what i find also works is saying we'll back it up and then again keeping it mysterious when i see people do so with e-commerce ads and other type of ads it's so dumb to me when they go and they just tell the person like hey come here and we'll show you how to get get this hat or take this acne supplement and it will clear up your acne no you want to use something that like creates that mystery like this weird weird micro toxin actually reverses wrinkles in people over the age of 63 years old watch us back it up here and then you link them to the ecommerce product that does that same exact concept for info proc same exact concept for sales call funnels it goes on and on and on so this right here if you apply this i think you're gonna do so much better on facebook because if you actually scroll through and look at most facebook you can tell their ads right away like this is an ad but like if you see someone doing this i love russell if you see someone doing this you know it's an ad like moving around and like this this looks this screams that russell's gonna sell me something okay this one right here would be this would work great you can see anik for example if he was doing this and he actually ran this as an actual ad this would do great because it looks like tik tok content love my friend austin right here and i'm not seeing a huge amount of ads on facebook right here but again you don't want to have things that look like ads you want to have that youtubey like call to action right there you don't want to have something that looks like it's it was planned or something like that you want to have that tick tocky infographic type of ads that create interest and hook the eye to a focal point this looks like an ad 101 right here this is this is exactly the type of content people use on ads this screams i'm going to sell you something it screams you know the end of this story right here okay so i'm not hating on anybody's content or anything right here but it's just it's so obvious when you see people with these type of openings on their ads or with this type of content right here and then you see tiktaki style ads or infographic ads or just pure focal point youtube ads crushing it so that's a train for the day guys and again massive reminder especially if you're doing long term sales funnels where there's multiple different types of traffic sources you need to go out there when you're running your facebook ads as well optimize off of actual roi not opt-ins or cost per caller clicks or add the cards optimize around roi and then actually track things correctly with all your traffic sources combined in facebook the ad dashboard is not putting all your traffic sources in one place i also have google ads running i have people that come directly to our website and facebook is also going to give itself all sorts of view throughs and double count things and you can't verify it so that's the rule number two now that being said if you want to have the same exact tracking that you've seen in this video again there's you can just go schedule a call below you can check out hires we have a 90
