hyrulian have you ever had an ad running it's doing great making tons of money your parents are even proud of you and then it just dies and your parents won't talk to you anymore hopefully all that has happened to you except the parents part because if you were in ads you've had eyes die on you just what happens when you run out so in this video i'm going to show you exactly how to fix your ads there's actually a series of questions and metrics you can look at if you focus on these in this order you'll get your ads fixed that's it i have nothing more to add to it except if you want to win and get three thousand dollars in ad courses every week in our community post area i post links to these courses and if you see this post you can click the link and you'll get access to courses for free you won't see the link unless you're subscribed to this channel so subscribe to this channel so you'll see the link because i take it down after 24 hours now let's get to the content let's go we're here to talk about okay guys so let's talk about this when your ad dies i see people get super duper confused they're like why is my ad dead what did i do wrong and is it something that's happening in the ad manager and i'm going to tell you straight up no it's not it i i very rarely ever see anybody fix or revive their ad campaigns or take a campaign it's gone like this and bring it back up again because they've figured out some bidding technique in the ad manager or there was something wrong with their audience if an ad worked before and it stopped working there's a very systematic way you can go about making the ad work again if it will work again not all ads will work again and not all offers are meant to go to distance i must be incredibly straightforward with that everybody else who talks about ads and everybody else who talks about internet marketing they act like you could sell anything online there are some things people don't want to buy the market's either full the market's saturated the product sucks it's not interesting to them there's been a thousand other products and everybody that's bothered about there's a billion things and reasons why people don't want to buy something and it can happen to your product so first off one of the reasons why your ads might fail is because people aren't interested in what you're selling you you're gonna have to look at that it's happened to me it's gonna happen to anybody in any business so just be aware of it next thing you need to look at is the layers of the ad and this is how we're gonna detect which things are wrong because there's the ad itself there's initial landing page and then there's the offer okay and there's the offer itself and in some cases there's going to be the funnel between or after the offers presented so let's talk about this when you're running and checking if your ads why they stopped working you need to be able to diagnose what what exactly went wrong okay is there a ton of money being spent with lower return have sales stopped what's happening so the first thing we're going to look at is you know first off let's look at the visit to conversion rate because this is going to be the number one thing okay look at the visit the conversion rate if 100 people still visited your offer and they're converting at 10 percent you're you're probably good okay and if if if this is good if everything else has gone to hell for example we used to be able to get a hundred people to our offer for ten dollars now it cost fifty dollars and we're not seeing an roi that's where the problem is going to be at this is the most important thing to check because this means people still want to buy your offer this means people still want to get there okay and so that's the most important thing to look at just look at your vizio ratio the sales particularly for a single campaign all right what a lot of people do is they have like 50 different campaigns well guess what these are 50 different types of people all coming through you don't want to look at the overall of all these different people because maybe one campaign is sending way more people than used to other ones not it's not an accurate metric look at your number one campaign and look at the conversion rate from that campaign of the people that clicked to the amount of people that bought well how can you do that accurately well you can use hiros because if you're not tracking your your ads accurately you're working off of inaccurate data and for example if you were trying to buy stocks in the stock market off of the wrong stock prices guess what you'd make the wrong choices it's the same thing with ads please use high-risk or something to track your ads there's a link below it we literally guarantee you'll see a 20 increase in your ads literally guarantee you don't pay for it check it out but this is what you need to do if you can't track amount of people coming to your page and their conversion rate then you already have another problem all right so once you confirm that hey look people are still buying the offer let's go down and actually look at what's going on here we'll talk about if the offer is the problem and that's that's a whole other bag of weeds right there so first off the ad how do we know if the ad is the problem okay well if you look at the ad you gotta ask yourself series of questions written right here okay so look here's the number one thing you look at did the cpc increase or the cpm i usually don't like to look at these stats but it can give you a hint okay so did the cpc or cpm increase if this did there's only one reason why this happened it's because people are not interacting with your ad the way they used to that's what's happening now of course your your network that you're running the ads on could have gotten more competitive or something your cpc or cpm it's largely not going to spike up and down you might see that with the ios updates or whatnot but usually you're not going to see a hundred percent 200 increase it's you're going to see a gradual increase over time because more people enter the market and the prices go up so what do you do in this incident right here okay what you want to do is you want to look at this and then you want to look at the conversion rates typical conversion rates in your landing page for example if it cost me five dollars to get a cpl uh or an opt-in and if i still have a forty percent opt-in rate on my landing page well the reason why my ads aren't working they're not working anymore it's because the cpc and cpm went up because either people are not interacting with my ads like they used to or they the cost simply went up so what do we do in the situation do we do we what's our option we only have one option make the ads better make the ads more attention grabbing get more clicks and engage the customer more okay that's that's really your only solution right there besides in some cases when you can't get the cpc or cpm down well you're just going to have to make everything else significantly better in your funnel so you can afford a higher cpc and cpm that's going to be the case especially as you scale you need to ask yourself as well all right well my ads working or do they fall apart because i started scaling well what happened is as cpc and cpm gets more expensive because you start interacting with customers that are not as engaged as your smaller audience customers if you're averaging or you're running ads to let's say 100 a day audience that audience is going to be much more targeted than a thousand dollar a day audience so these are going to go up immensely the way you scale is you make sure you have an ad and offer a landing page and everything that can work at scale to a broader audience or at least converts much higher that's where most people fall apart this who would my own full part at scale well it's because as soon as traffic actually gets somewhat expensive for you you can't afford it anymore because your offer isn't converting high enough your pages aren't converting on enough so that being said if you look at your ad and your cpc has not gone up but something's falling apart what you next want to go to is look at your landing page look at the metrics on it okay there's a few things that could actually happen has anything changed on your landing page go through and test your funnel this is something that most people don't do there's been all sorts of times where i've looked at my funnel on a mobile phone and like oh crap the headline is the size of the entire screen like you have it's not optimizing for a mobile phone or it's redirecting or it's loading seven 15 seconds too late on the screen let's fix this okay that's the most no-brainer thing to do always check that out just do a quick rundown load up your thing on load it up on a phone have other people load up your pages uh load up it from different browsers just look at it just look at it you might see something weird usually what's gonna happen is it's probably gonna be something wrong with the mobile phone i've seen times where people can't opt in from their mobile phone but they can opt in from desktop and because you work on a desktop you don't see that next thing you want to look at is if that looks okay look at the conversion rate on the lane page let's say we have an opt-in page are people still opting in at 30 percent are people still booking calls at the same amount okay look at the base uh lead stats okay look at the base lead stats if you have a e-commerce store are people adding the cart the same amount they use too okay look at these base stats because if people aren't doing these things if for example they're not adding the cart like they used to they're not uh opting in they used to they're not booking calls like used to opposites landing page obviously the landing page if if you're most important stat right here as well that you want to look at is again you want to look at for example our opt-in to buying the offer or add the cart to buying the offer our booking to buying the offer okay if this stays the same right here then we don't really have a problem to offer we have a problem with getting the the initial first step done so you have to look at the first step and say okay what's up with the first step is the way the same it used to be okay so you got to ask yourself again what has changed in the campaign overall did we just start scaling the campaign do we start growing the campaign if so we're getting in a more broad audience that's getting us lower of these so if our cpm and cpc is looking good as we scale well then what we've got to look at is these things right here all right or add the carts down well you're gonna have to get more people to add the cart you're gonna have to improve the copy on the page you get more people who want to buy the product simple okay our opt-ins down we have to improve the opt-in page get that opt-in page higher again you're gonna have to increase that increasing an opt-in page is the number one way to increase the amount of revenue from your offer difference between 20 and 30 opt-in rate page on the actual conversions is insane because you're getting in people 10 or in this case right here 30 cheaper and you're getting in 30 more sales it's it goes both ways when you do that okay same thing with bookings what's going on okay what's going on what's going on with the bookings you want to if you get people to opt in and book a call why have they stopped booking and did you just start scaling that's always a big question you asked i just start scaling but if you're scaling and it starts to fall apart you want to look at why it's falling apart if there's if there's a specific part of your funnel that is operating the same way say for example the ads and the clicks uh cost the same okay well if these are falling apart is there something else in the funnel that's falling apart you don't have to actually kill all your scale if one part of it's working but the other parts are not so finally the most important part if these are the same and this is the same you got to look at the offer and so the way you actually really get better results from your ads overall is you got to ask yourself these questions so the best way to get results overall is you got to ask yourself these questions okay so ask yourself these things you got to ask yourself has the market change for example when i was doing my shopify e-commerce offer i was the first person on youtube doing it two years later i was not the first person doing it has the market changed yes in that situation yes it did okay are there competitors that are simply better than you or are you the only one before now there's 15 other businesses are people just simply not buying this thing anymore for example people were buying seo products a few years ago in the make money online niche then they start buying shopify products and they start buying amazon products i don't know what they're buying now but it goes in seasons people move on other things now they're buying crypto products for example market changes you got to be aware of this not no market stays the same for multiple years um how how what can the pages or sales pages do better you got to look at it sometimes you just have really crappy pages just don't don't sell the product well and what can you do about the offer itself okay so the sales page one is very simple but what can you do about the offer to make it more unique or a better fit for example if you're selling the same thing as the entire marketplace how can you make this product stand out how can you make it a better fit for a specific type of customer how could you even market to a different type of customer that is a better fit for example convertkit when they were doing email marketing they didn't compete with mailchimp and trying to recruit everybody need to send emails they went after bloggers they made the product it was most specific and functional for bloggers because of that they could run ads to bloggers extremely efficiently that's how they made a more unique product that's how they got better proc market fit and that's the market needing something that you're selling is not already being sold to them it fits the market it fits what is needed in the market and the market badly wants exactly what you're selling you can always change the market you can change what you're selling look at this because it's important okay you also have to ask yourself what procs for example when i was selling a product based around building your business or whatnot i'd ask myself all right at the end of the webinar if a person's not buying it why aren't they buying it it's because they don't think it will work for them so i got to ask myself why don't people think this will work for them okay do they understand it look at your pitch and offer and think do people actually understand this do they if i ask them what are you buying and what's it going to do for you and how does it work do you can they do that because if a person doesn't understand what they're buying they're not going to buy it okay crazy little thing understanding is imperative for people to buy something are they motivated enough to buy it so for example if i'm selling a and i'm just going to use the make money online example because it's so easy to explain because it's just a base human emotion if a person is happy with their job and comfortable why would they buy make money online product okay if a person is happy with their body weight why would they not if they're comfortable being fat why would they buy a weight loss product what you need to do is if a person is comfortable with their acne and their skin you have to make them uncomfortable with it that's called causing a little bit of pain at the beginning of your sales pitch think about stuff like that how are people in enough pain to buy something people usually buy something they get an emotion and most times when they buy products escape some sort of pain okay for example i bought this microphone because i watched my videos and it was painful for me to sound scoochy and not sound professional in my videos so if i want to actually sell this microphone better i would show videos of people having that painful product problem and then showing how much it's losing them in sales how much how embarrassing it is how it makes them look stupid online compared to competitors that will cause me pain then i'll buy a microphone it's imperative are people in pain when they're doing that why don't people think it's a sure thing you know for example if i was super mad about my microphone and i didn't buy this microphone why why don't i think this microphone will improve my results a lot of times customers just don't think your product will work for them ask them if you have like a webinar where you're selling like i don't know a guitar training class why don't people think they will learn how to play guitar by the end of it and then you can address that in your sales pitch well i you know i'm a beginner and i don't think i'm have enough time address that in your sales pitch okay um is it a sure is the sure thing worth the price for example this microphone right here i believe is 270 bucks this better sound to me is worth it to me if this thing was 10 000 i would not buy this microphone i simply would not i would i would find some alternative you also had to ask yourself is the thing you're selling if it would 100 work for the customer worth of them so for example if i was selling and make money online course of course making as much money as you want for the rest of your life that's a hundred that's worth a hundred thousand dollars the thing is people don't believe it's a sure thing therefore they're not going to buy it so the price is relevant to them believing it's a sure thing the more you can make them feel the sure thing the more likely they're going to buy it which can swing both ways because if they buy something it's a sure thing and it doesn't end up being a sure thing you'll be in trouble all right so all the people that sell make money online products you'd be careful um and then finally why don't they believe it's a sure thing and then finally if that's one of the cases how can you remove the thing that stops it from being a sure thing can you do work for them can you fill in the blanks can you give them templates can you automate processes can you do it for them for example when people were buying hirose they worry if they could set tracking on their own we said don't worry we'll handle that part okay so again if you're not tracking your ads correctly you should check out hiros because if you do you'll make twenty percent more from your ads oh here's another secret all right if your ads are broken it might be because you're not tracking accurately and you're inaccurately bidding and spending the wrong amounts on the ads and then you're also feeding that data back to the ad platform which is bad data instead of using accurate data which leads to you even having worse targeting so maybe if you like your ads are off by 20 30 or something like that maybe you should track them correctly maybe you should schedule call hiros below we guarantee you're going to see a 20 to 30 increase in your ads so that being said this is all i have for you in the video this is how i have fixed every ad campaign i've ever had that can be fixed some ad campaigns need to be taken out back and shot okay just lying out there but this is how i fixed every single ad campaign that i've ever had a problem with it never came from finding some secret bidding strategy in the ad manager it always always always always came from focusing on those three different layers of the the offer that i'm
