hyrulians this 2021. we're going to do the same exact thing we did last year i'm going to give you the best ad content you've ever got and today i'm going to simply give you what is in the title of this video i'm going to show you the best funnels to be running on youtube ads and unlike people who hype stuff up and like this is the best thing ever i'm just going to show you from my experience one of these funnels uh actually was generating almost nearly on some days a hundred thousand dollars per day and this other funnel that i've used a lot is routinely pumping out for at least my business around twenty to thirty thousand dollars back a day off about almost two thousand dollars an ad spend so they're really good but of course it's about how the funnels work and how they interact altogether but if you're going to be running ads on youtube or on facebook these are the best from everything that i've seen across hiros myself being the ceo of that i'm not going to talk about anything that our clients are doing but of course i have a pretty good thumb on the pulse of the industry from what i've seen every single time i see a really successful business running on youtube they're running one of these so without further ado we're just going to hop straight into this and so without further ado this and by the way as you watch this video if you want to get actually coaching or training or consulting on this i'm going to teach you everything i know in this video but if you'd like more of that book a call with me below my team we can actually help you get set up on youtube as well but more importantly let me show you this works okay guys so i said i was going to talk about a few of the best funnels but there's really only one funnel i think you should really be looking at and considering and if you can't do this funnel i think you should take the reasons why this funnel works and take it to as much hard as you can every single person who i know that has made a hundred million dollars plus from ads and this isn't this is a hyperbole statement they run this funnel now of course there's other examples but most commonly the people that do it the easiest for example i have a really good friend i'm not going to name him if you're in the marketing world you might know who he is he's not he's not a mmo slash make money online marketer just does something for businesses make close to i'm just going to say a number because you'll guess if i give you the number he made over 80 to 100 million dollars in sales and he barely ran any money on ads it was next to nothing and what i'm going to show you in this video is i'm going to be straight up with yet hi-ros and iron my consulting business we really don't run many ads i'm shocked by it because i consistently spend about a thousand to it max 3 000 a day on ads usually around about 2 000 and routinely i'm going to do about and of course there's going to be hard costs of the business and everything else that comes with it i'm just talking about add roi cash in same day i'm usually going to be doing anywhere between 15 to sometimes as much as 35k a day off it's absolutely bonkers and i've never had a funnel that works like this before i had a webinar funnel when i was running h-com but i'd be spending 15 to 25k a day back and i'd say the roi on that when everything was said and done was anywhere between 35 on a good day where we had good margins and what that 50k a day okay and this is hard to do and not sustainable this right here i'm it's like i'm driving a car and i'm i'm barely having my phone on the gas this right here man i'm putting uh alcohol in the engines and i'm drunk at the same it's it's risky endeavor so let's talk about this and if you've probably seen any of my funnels you know their sales call funnels but i want to show you the two types of funnels that i run and why they're very very different let me tell you first why sales call funnel works and i'm going to show you my phone highros which i think is it's magnificent okay i've never had anything that pumps up this high of an roi i'm gonna break down why that works here in a second but you need to understand why sales call funnels are just basically the best thing for paid ads so look a lot of people think paid ads the goal is to make money now that's true that's true but the goal of ads really is to cover ad costs to get people into your business this is where the golden goose is everyone who doesn't make a lot of money thinks like this everybody who does make a lot of money thinks like this for example not a famous quote from russell brunson but i know he runs his ads just like this and he says all the time the goal of click funnels with their advertising is just to get people in to their business without losing money and that's not even in the clickfunnels just into the community okay so if they spend a hundred dollars and if they make 110 that's a phenomenal roi absolutely absolutely fantastic this is how clickfunnels grew into a giant company uh if you look at most sas companies or most tech companies how they run is for example hubspot let's imagine a person pays 100 a month over there they're willing to spend twelve hundred dollars to get that person in because they know the person is going to stay over two years so they don't make their money back 2x until two years in which if you look at an investment standpoint it's phenomenal we're just really short sighted here in internet marketing and ad buying the best way to make a return on ad spend is to maximize the amount you make from the buyers the way you do that is like this for example let's say we get a thousand people come into a funnel okay we're paying ten dollars per person we just paid ten thousand dollars so getting seven percent of these people seven percent of this which is actually pretty low actually we'll even crank it up if we get ten percent of these people to buy let's just say a fifty dollar product so we get a hundred people to buy a fifty dollar product we made five thousand dollars that's not five thousand this isn't great which is weird because this conversion rate right here is insane i've never gotten a 10 conversion even on like a seven dollar product okay i have but it was like doing a launch and doesn't count that's not how ads work if we get a thousand people to come in and we get three of them to buy a 5 000 product we just made a 50 roi it's not hard to get a 0.003 conversion rate it is extremely hard extremely hard to go and get a 10 conversion rate this is why it works better with ads this is the simple basic reason why i almost actually i haven't ran a low ticket product in almost six years because it doesn't work very well it's really hard to do and i don't like hard things because i'm kind of stupid so why do sales call funnels work the best it's very simple if we get a thousand people to come into a funnel specifically if it's like b2b or b2c i would say there's probably about 20 people who are capable of buying this very very high ticket product that you're going to sell in a sales call funnel now in order to maximize if we do like a webinar funnel or a sales video or just send them to a sales video it's just not going to convince these people and to get someone to buy something very expensive they usually need to be sold to specifically so you can listen to them and see what they're looking for and then sell them what they're looking for and i'm not i'm not saying in a scuzzy way for example at hiros a person might have an e-commerce business or a webinar business they might have certain problems that they have there's different other businesses and so we need to ask them what problems you are okay yeah my webinar sales i can't track the ltv and i'm really trying to get the ltv of my opt-ins okay you can easily do that in hi-ros oh okay great i'll buy or hey i just can't see where my sales are coming from for example i run my ads and 30 to 50 percent of sales are missing in the ad managers so i can't make good decisions okay well you know high risk fixes that instantly or hey you know the ai isn't finding me customers well enough okay well hyrus fixes that instantly because we sent data back over so it's it's very easy for us to talk to the person figure out what they're looking for and we can easily sell them something at a very high value that's why it's a very simple concept you can't do this with a webinar you can't do this with a sales video now are those more low effort and more automated yeah of course but again the goal of an ad and this is where the real juice in a sales call funnel comes from is to get people opted into the business because then you can do all sorts of marketing all sorts of marketing for example at hcom a lot of the money didn't come from the initial ads it came from the people who opted into the ads now that also being said if we need a person opt-in and then we have a sales call funnel which is really the only funnel i think can do like a forex cash roi easy i don't see other funnels doing that and i see a lot of funnels other ones that are exceptions this rule yeah i'm sure there might be someone in the comments but like i had a book funneled it pumped out of 10x roi that's fantastic most funnels i see the big ones the big webinar funnels they're probably doing a 2x roi max most of them break even most low ticket funnels i see they lose money and then they make money in the back end all the sales call funnels i see it's just clown mode okay again one of the most profitable ones i ever saw y'all saw he barely ran ads and that's how you want your business to be now i'm probably pretty sure that you've seen a sales call funnel before by the way everything i go into here if you want us to actually look at your sales call funnel and kind of show you how we run ads you can book a consultation with me below and we'll just literally walk through how i'm doing this on youtube and facebook on the call that also being said with these funnels the most imperative thing is tracking if you run a sales call funnel or a webinar funnel or you have a long sales funnel you probably already see that most of your sales don't end up in the ad manager at least you're missing 30 40 percent of them track it with highrose because if you're going and this is just a general tip for sales call funnels because if you're watching this you might have one or our long-term funnel look if you have three ducks one two three and one of them is pumping out a 400 roi one of them is pumping out a 50 roi another one's pumping out 150 ry you need to know which ones are because if they're if you're going and spreading them equally based on the opt-in which is what most people do or some general other stat that's not based around roi you're silly because you could literally just cut this guy off you could cut this guy off and you could just quadruple down on this guy and your business is now way more profitable growing much faster simply by doing nothing okay and then you push this back to the ai your ai gets smarter and then that's the pixels that you're working with and then you get customers much cheaper it calls much cheaper and it just works and you should do it and if you're not tracking properly especially with the sales component where you can't even see the sales inside of facebook and youtube i can't tell you how many people i know with sales call funnels that don't track based on roi they trapped on it they track based on cost per call and often it's insane because if you're doing that then you're optimizing for the cheapest people that will book calls which is not your best customer i have call funnels where the calls are 400 a call and they absolutely just wreck shop okay so let's discuss this right here this is my first sales call funnel this one works really well i'm going to show you the one that works best but if you're doing info marketing or some type of like consulting where you're doing an ad agency or maybe you're like helping specific types of businesses this is what i would suggest doing and i'll talk about when to run what i'm using for hirose next so look it's just a basic opt-in right here person comes in books gmail.com and they move on to the next page so i'm going to give you just a few cents on this what i love to do on this type of call funnel right here is i basically have as short as video as i possibly can i want to get it done in about 10 minutes below i don't i don't really don't like linking these things below the video so you just can kind of go figure it out to yourself but you can just see right here this is basically just a seven minute sales video okay and actually i'll upload the sales video as a private link below this uh just on the channel i'll just put like a sales video example section so this thing works really really well and what's going to happen is about 10 minutes in the person gets the book a call then they're going to go a very simple call page like this and they just book a call with my rep and they go through this is what works if you look at some other funnels they're so complicated upsells down cells you got these webinar funnels are crazy i'm really good at them but they're just crazy this works absolutely fantastic and so i would really suggest running this if you're specifically youtube ads and this on facebook like this is just this is just what you should do in 2021 and if you can't do you should find some way to sell the most expensive product you possibly can on your front end to cover your ad costs and you can make all your money in your back end this is why i absolutely love this funnel now let me show you the real golden goose because i love this one because what you should try to do on your funnels when you're running ads is you want to remove as many parts as possible usually with this opt-in funnel this works really well the one i just showed you because this is how you run it and this works better with my info product you want to run the opt-in funnel with info products because what you're doing is usually the person's already seen what you're selling you're not selling a unique opportunity for example if you're selling seo you're selling some some course or something like that there's a thousand other things out there so you kind of have to lure them in and really kind of work on them and so you want to run the ad to the opt-in and what's going to happen is they're going to see the first video and you might actually make money just from there but where it really becomes easy is if you have an email sequence that just goes on for months and you just keep sending them valuable content with a link to buy or a link to book a call and i mean if you send really good content to people eventually they're just going to book a call with you because they opt in in the first place because they're interested in what you're offering they're interested at least in the results if you just prove that you're the right guy you're trustworthy and can deliver the results over and over again by sending them really high value packed videos which is what i'm doing to you right now you're not stupid um [Music] but let's also be frank if you're a high roast user you make more money from your advertising you upgrade your account and you pay us more let's just be frank with what i'm doing here and that's why i'm just telling you i'm just giving you the farm right here because i want your ad accounts to grow because then you're going to run in the tracking issues and then you're going to use hyrus to solve them and we're all going to win you're going to make more money i'm going to make more money and then we can go hang out and have a birthday party somewhere i'm not coming to your birthday party you probably don't want me there i'm i'm i'm a real wet blanket anyways so just some general two cents on funnels so if you look at this page right here it's literally just a single page and what you want to do if you're in a b2b business is specifically where you have something unique and you can guarantee results like i do at highrose for example we have a 90 day refund guarantee if you don't increase your ad roi which is up to you or you're not happy with the results you just don't pay okay so that allows me to make just this crazy offer where we're going to increase your ad roi you don't pay this is essential with with b2b call funnels if you can't guarantee a result and you're doing b2b that's just weird okay uh that also being said we scroll down right here what i like to do on a b2b sales call funnel that works very well is you can see i have a very short video the the pitch the book a call actually comes out about 45 seconds in and all i try to really do in a b2b video is i try to show people the opportunity loss that they're missing and this is essential for ads b2b you don't ever want to sell some mysterious like benefit you want to be very simple i'm selling you a hundred dollar bill for twenty dollars a person signs up for hiros they stand for high uh iron the entire pitch is like look you can make a hundred dollars if you pay us twenty dollars you can make more money from your ads you can make more money from your business with youtube ads tracking and if you don't you don't pay us and that just works great because i can back up all the results i have more results with youtube ad coaching than anybody ever and then hyrus the results are ridiculous so that's what you want to do if you're in that type of position you can describe your business like that don't go for the opt-in go and run a single page and then show people your results and then make it very clear that you're selling a hundred dollar bill for twenty dollars okay they can just come on and they will get the results that they're looking for which is making more money from their things all businesses want to grow all businesses want to grow so if you can go and make that case very strongly and guarantee it just shoot for that as long as you can make the case and clearly show that you can do it and make them understand the case okay so just a one-page funnel and then what i like to do on this actual funnel right here is i like to give everybody everything all at once so you can see what i do is i make the case up here and then what i do is i show basically specific instances because the person looking at this page probably has specific problems and so what i do is i say hey look if you want to see it actually in action go check out these specific videos on these things that being said this main video right here makes the case and if that's all i need to make it's a seven minute video goes 14 minutes breaking down what's going to be on the call but you can just skip all this stuff right here and go there because most of the time b2b businesses or owners they're not going to watch a 30 minute but you can't even get me to watch a 7 minute cat video that way you're going to get me to watch a video on ad tracking for seven minutes come on that's what i like to do for b2b and unique b2b businesses look if you're selling seo you're selling the same exact thing that everybody else is you might actually be able to pull off the single page thing but if you're selling info marketing you're selling make money online courses you're selling like fitness courses you're probably gonna need to run the opt-in call funnel instead and again you're probably thinking well you know i don't feel comfortable selling a two thousand five thousand ten thousand dollar product you should and this doesn't have to be your core product you need to sell one of your higher level products up first because then you can get everybody in via the opt-in and you can sell your lower level products first them and you can send them through these sequences which is where the real money is the goal of ads the goal of the offer yourself formats is to pay for the ad if you can break even on the ad while getting people in you are a dynamo you are awesome you should you should have a small parade if you can make money like a two three x roi or doing it well then you're as cool as me and you can come to my secret squirrel club it's it's a tree house outside my apartment it's actually made of boxes and it's really cool it's for secret scrolls only you don't want to go there it kind of smells but that being said guys this is the lesson for today i just want to break down how these funnels work to you and make them make you really aware of them because when i look at hirostats when i look at my stats when i look at all the funnels i've ran throughout the years this thing just dominates and i can't imagine running any other funnels because they're so tough webinar funnels are tough um they work though they work like crazy okay i was able to scale the hcom funnel past a million dollars per month some months that's it what that's insane lower ticket funnels i'm not talented enough to do that if you can do that you should come up here and teach instead and then sales call funnels i've worked very very very hard on the highest funnel and the whole reason it works very very well is because also we always deliver results or people don't pay for them makes it easy to sell it so just keep that in mind so that being said guys if you're interested in learning more about this or applying this to your business number one why not just book a call with me if you have a sales call phone or an info funnel we can connect it to youtube ads and you'll make significantly more about if you don't if you don't believe me go click the consultation link below and see literally some of the hundreds of businesses that i've gotten significant results i'm not talking like hey oaks is really nice and i like them i mean like their business came in and they're making a lot more money now if you want to actually track your ads and you want to run your ads correctly and make the correct most profitable decisions while turning off the unprofitable ads click the link below this video it will give you a demo of hyrule so we'll show you everything we do and i literally guarantee that if you sign up for hirose you will see an roi increase in your ads or we just give you your money back that's it that also being said subscribe this channel i'm uploading about three to four times a week here i give away all the ad content i can in about 12 to 15 minutes for the very simple reason is if you're my customer you're not my customer if you make more money from ads you're going to want to become a customer or you're going to increase your high rose account so i'm just going to tell you everything i know and i know quite a bit so subscribe i'll just keep telling it to you it's been
