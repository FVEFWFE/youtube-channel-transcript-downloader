the first 5 Seconds of a YouTube ad you mess this up you're toast you're not going to make any money but if you nail this you can mess up pretty much everything else and you're going to see your cpls your cost per acquisition your Roi just Skyrocket and I see this messed up more than anything else in YouTube ads when I'm helping people grow their businesses on YouTube and I also see this everywhere in the day and hyros so I'm going to show you exactly how to make sure you get your first 5 Seconds right hey this is Alex Becker I'm the CEO of hyros the fastest growing ad Tracking Company in the entire world right now the YouTube ad coach with the most results out of any YouTube ad coach in the entire world as well and doing both those things gives me an ability to show you exactly what is working in ads with nothing held back so what I'm going to do right now is actually just do that I'm going to show you to nail the first 5 Seconds of your YouTube ad this has been the absolute key to me generating tens of millions of dollars in return on my YouTube ads and I think it will help you a lot so let's get going okay guys let's get the cold turnning so we're looking at one of my best performing ads for hyros and I could use any of my businesses the ads I run for iron my YouTube Mastermind does very well you should book a call below uh but you can also see the same pattern in my old info marketing businesses and any ads I've ever ran ever for anything and people that don't get this who try to run YouTube ads they just fail because your YouTube ads won't work without this so let's just watch this magical 5 Seconds you're probably going to be very underwhelmed you want customers from ads much cheaper and the scale much further our software hyros will do that for you or you don't pay for it no Ser okay so what did I accomplish in those 5 Seconds you want customers from ads much cheaper and the scale much further our software hyros will do that for you or you don't pay for it easy what most people do on YouTube is they think the first 5 seconds is meant to grab attention I cannot tell you how many YouTube ads I see that you can't tell what the ad is for and what the hook is and who it's talking to in the first 5 Seconds and that's the key okay again watch this first 5 Seconds watch if you can see who I'm talking to what the benefit is and then why they should keep watching like what's the hook you want customers from ads much it so in the first 5 Seconds of the ad what I do right here is I do three very specific things I call out to the person I want to be talking to I offer the immediate benefit or I show a benefit that's going to Peak their curiosity and then I also make a hook these are the three things that must be achieved in the first 5 seconds because what most people are going to do is they're going to do this they're they're going to say something for 5 seconds that doesn't do this and this is terrible for YouTube ads CU what you want to do in your first 5 seconds is completely hook everyone you want to talk to and repulse everyone you don't want to talk to because you pay for the views on people you don't want to talk to so for example if you're running a ad for let's say an ad Tracking Company like hyros the last thing you want is people who don't run ads watching the video because you're going to pay for those that's the big oopsy Poopsy that people don't understand if a person is a farmer if a person is the 99.5% of the population that hasn't ever touched an ad account or doesn't buy customers from I don't want them watching the video so do you think that type of person do you think anyone other than an ad Runner would watch this you want customers from ads first two seconds person goes no not really clicks away all right so that's the first thing right there you you need to remember this this is the most important lesson scare away everyone that is not your Target customer immediately and call out to your Target customer immediately now the next is not just hey do you run YouTube ads and do you like like socks no there must be a clear clear benefit for them to watch okay and so what's the benefit in this ad right here customers cheaper pay less make more money okay call to the C the Target customer present a benefit in the first 5 Seconds what's the benefit here pretty easy I just laid it out but let's go over it real quick you want customers from ads much cheaper in the scale much further customers from ads cheaper scale much further now the most important thing about this 5 Seconds too is you understand the benefits that are most important to your customer what a lot of people do when they're using this this technique is they use weak benefits not all benefits are created equal I know from watching my customers at high RIS watching how they interact with ads I know that saving money on ads and scaling further or paying cheaper for sales and scaling further are their top the Gena of what they're looking for I could talk about hey are you having trouble tracking your ads won't work won't work that benefit won't work I say hey are you having trouble tracking the long-term value of your customers nope won't work I will see my ad costs and my cost per acquisition Spike if I use those benefits if I don't call out to the first person and repulse the other people if I don't call out to my Target customer repulse non-target customers my ad costs will Spike I can see it in my ads like a lot of people like how do you get cheap clicks and cheap conversion on YouTube I can literally change out this first sentence and I can watch everything change in my Roi it's not some secret betting technique then there must be a powerful hook now the hook can be two things it can be a challenge it can be a promise of explaining something that's mysterious or it can be a story I don't like the story one but it it has worked for me a few times let me let me explain this so a challenge what's what's the challenge in this ad and this works really good B2B the scale much further our software hyros will do that for you or you don't pay for it so what's the challenge in this ad our software will do this or you don't pay for it oh really so me an ad Runner that's been called out to can save money and scale the two things I'm most interested in and I don't have to pay for it if I don't do that okay you got my attention so the next one using mystery what I used to do in an ad that worked really well is I'm going to show you how I turn this molf mug into $60,000 a year in income okay that's people are like what I'm like yeah I'm I'm going to show you how I use this ugly wolf mug so I start this ad off with a wolf mug this is a this is a mug okay uh but I'm going to say look I'm going to show you how we make tens of thousands of dollars a year from this wolf mug okay and you need to understand that in that 5 Seconds I've called out to everybody that wants to make more money so I've already called out the benefit and to the target audience by saying that you have to understand that when you are writing ad copy or communicating with humans this is essential for copywriting there is many ways to say the same thing with different words this is one of the biggest problems people have when it comes to copywriting okay just like when you're communicating with a human how you say things can be just as powerful as the words that you actually say for example if if you look at uh liberals and Republicans if a republican asks a liberal oh so you voted for Biden he's technically saying you're a crazy liberal who supports communism liberals on the other side if they ask a republican oh so you voted for Trump they're really saying oh so you're a crazy bigot fascist crazy person you see it all the time in the news that's just a very upfront examples you see every day of people saying one thing completely different than what they're actually saying and so what you must understand with ads is that what I just said right here in the pattern I just laid out can be conveyed without following this template you can say one thing and still achieve the same exact effect and say the same thing anyways that's the next one right there use a mystery okay there must be a mystery to calls out to the target audience the final one is a story so one of my other most successful ma ads was I would start the ad with saying this is match Smith I'm going to show you how he made how he went from zero to 30k a month to uh 200k a month in in I think I said like 3 months selling cat socks okay so again this story right here covers all the basis of the call to the target audience people that want to make money the benefit how to make money fast 30 to 200k okay that's what it's saying right there and in the story The Hook is hey I'm going to I'm going to complete the story about how you made 200k on cat socks these are the three things that must be achieved and again you don't need to say it in a cookie cutter template you need to achieve these three things for example if I was calling out the people that had stomach problems maybe acid reflex I'd start the video of this weird fruit just totally stopped me from having acid reflux in my sleep they there's there's a call out to the person who has acid reflux there's a mystery and there's a benefit okay there's a story they want to know that and so this is how you make the first 5 Seconds of your YouTube ad Pop I really challenge you today as you watch videos watch how many videos do not accomplish this in the first five seconds just watch it there's there's one that runs on this channel all the time where some guy goes you know I'm going to break all the rules of traditional advertising and do this thing for it he does that he doesn't explain what he's doing in the first five seconds that might do okay I don't think it does or probably doesn't do better than my ads that being said this is super duper important so that being said guys that's the content for the today just two bonus tips for you if you're running YouTube ads at all and you're not using hyos tracking you're going you're shooting yourself in the foot look look at the tracking from Google right here caught uh two calls two calls and three calls when there was actually six calls right here I caught one call right here there's actually five and as I go through my account you're going to see tracking from major ad platforms completely failing right now if you're not tracking your ads you are literally making wrong decisions all right this one right here only caught 50% of my conversions if I'm not operating off 100% of my actual data about 50% of my ad scaling decisions are going to be wrong about 50% of my ad scaling decisions are going to be wrong that's going to lead to me wasting money in my account and killing ads that are actually scaling and doing well for example I might
