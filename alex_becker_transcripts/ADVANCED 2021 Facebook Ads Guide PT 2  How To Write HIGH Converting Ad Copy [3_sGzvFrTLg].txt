================================================================================

you welcome back to the facebook advanced ad course basically where i'm sharing everything i've done the scale business past six hundred thousand dollars per month of about a hundred thousand dollars a month in ad spend in this video i'm going to be getting into facebook ad copy basically everything i've learned about it and everything i think will work regardless of what niche you're in again you might be wondering why am i doing this well what i like to do whenever i nail down an ad platform i like to make a super advanced course in it just like our youtube ad course where i scale the business past a million dollars a month you should check that one out if you get bored too that being said i don't want to waste your time because i hate when people waste my time so just hop straight into it i want to show you what i think is the best ad copy and at least one of the highest performing ways to write your ads on facebook so uh all right everyone welcome back to the whiteboard of truth and justice it's ugly it's bad the presentation value is less than five dollars but this is basically where every major ad discovery in the history of man has ever been discovered so you're welcome this is what genius looks like i'm done making jokes let's actually talk about ad copy all right so look the first three things i want to teach you and the biggest thing about ad copy is actually not doing stupid things and i'm going to show you my three highest converting types of ad copy but they're not going to work if you do stupid things because if you do stupid things usually you get bad results and these are the stupid things i see chronically all right so here's stupid thing number one look at this sidebar ad right here legend london dot co it's got the shirt off what what and what gravy's name is going on right here what is this selling what is this doing rule number one the ad copy is it has to make some form of sense if you're putting ads up and they're going in the sidebar or they're going on instagram and parts of the ad are missing that are not missing on other parts of the ad for example this is obviously meant to run in the news feed they probably description or something with the ad what will make sense well if you're doing that that's stupid it's stupid as much as facebook is going to optimize your ads it's not going to out optimize stupidity this right here driving sales driving traffic but no sales we're in an ant techs get 300 credits i don't know what they're selling right here i don't know what they're selling right here and this is a tic tac ad tick talk ad tic tac tic tuck i don't you see the kids posting their faces and dances on there and i'm glad i'm not 15 anymore those people are terrifying anyways look check out the difference with this ad so check this out right here this is what's going to look like in the sidebar at least somewhat like that this added a drops add costs 52 in some case studies we have this guy holding this little chip so what's going on here is this the only way you should design your ads no no but i have ads that are specifically made for the sidebar i have ads that are specifically made for instagram because you're going to see dramatically different displays on different networks look at this right here there's no headline okay so this ad right here where you see this headline right here this big sexy headline that gets a juice it's not going to do as well on instagram because if you run ads in 2020 and you're not using ai tracking script you're at a huge disadvantage you cuts off if i want to run this on instagram i want to put a headline right here something that tells them what they're going to get if they click and then get everything before this more thing because we all know people on instagram they're not there to read all right they're there to look at kylie jenner's butt and so that being said you know you got to distract them from that thing okay so what you need to do is you need to go and really hit them hard with an instagram ad this wouldn't work well on instagram very very important you need to design your ads for the platform they're going to be on but you're going to think whoa to put the most possible place yes but you can get an absolutely great return if you optimize for instagram only and then you could really crush it not only in the news feed but then also on instagram and then also in the sidebar you can actually do fantastic in the sidebar area because everybody's ads look like this because everyone's a goof troop and tries to run the same exact ad on every single place ad copy 101 don't be a freaking idiot okay don't be a goof troop don't be a pressed ham next the goal of the ad is to click so what i see people trying to do is i see them try and make the sale and the ad so they have like a long winded video they have a long text and don't get me wrong there's a place in time and i'm sure you whoever you followed in ads is like what you want to do you want to write a story that convinces the person to change their life and no you you goof what you want to do is you want to get the person to click the damn ad so then you can actually grind on them because guess what's happening when a person is going through their news feed okay i have all my news feed blocked because i'm smart and i don't use social media but we're selling the people like you who watch social media videos i love you please keep using social media i need you to look at my ads but look when i'm going through my ads you can see this ad right here actually has a very long-winded copy it is it is a it is a storybook of why you should use ai tracking with your ads by the way you want to know why you should use ai tracking with your ads here's a bunch of call funnels okay so check this out i'm using hi-ros it's obviously as you know i'm the ceo of pyro some wee bit bias but i'm also this weird type of crazy person that actually likes to scale their ads based on accurate data because what happens if you scale your ads based on inaccurate data and in la la land data that isn't actually real you get la la land money which isn't isn't accepted at whole foods you can't spend it there okay so i like to work with real numbers so i can actually make real money you can see right here with the calls that came in right here first off hyrus caught seven calls you might be wondering was facebook agreed with the trucking is it just missing stuff i can go through and find every single little call that comes into my business and i can see every single click the person's done okay i can see this person i've been tracking them all this away since july to their click here on to their click here in october every single call that comes to my business is attributed not being said there's seven calls reported right here facebook reported 11 because it gives itself all sorts of wonky view through conversions and weird other conversions you can also see it here there's actually a call that came in right here facebook reported no nothing came in and then facebook isn't even able to track the call conversions on the phone and actual numbers if a person comes back and buys one two days later forget about it and then we're not even operating around profit which if you're running ads and you're not operating around your actual accurate roi you're a goblin i don't know what's going on stop doing it no matter ad copy is going to allow you to escape being irresponsible with your ad spend and not working off of accurate numbers and accurate data literally the same exact thing is going on in adwords if you go right here reported i got five calls actually had six report i had one i had two reported ad four i had seven if i'm going off this data right here i'm gonna be turning off my best ad sets and if you're doing that you're just goblin level ad running and you can have great copy but if you're turning off ads that are making you money or investing in ads that literally aren't making any money or getting you a bad cost per call or bad cost per sale dude stop it just stop you don't have to do that just book an analysis call with hyrus below and we'll just literally fix it for you in seconds but that being said getting back on topic the goal of an ad if you looked at that last ad i showed you i have this giant giant copy inside of it okay giant amount of copy but the goal is not to get someone to read or be sold on the ad the goal of the ad is to get them to click with intent and curiosity that's the goal a lot of people will say hey just get the click or a lot of people will try and sell it in the ad that's not what you want to do there because when a person is skimming through facebook they're at whole foods looking at your ad while also looking at a candy bar or they're walking around or they're sitting at their house watching pewdiepie i don't know but they're not in a phase where they can be actively convinced or sold to they can be curiosity peaked and you can start a trigger or a behavior train which is basically where the person clicks and out of curiosity and they're more likely to do the next thing and they're more likely the next thing if i have an ad right here that says click for cat pictures and a person clicks the ad they're not going to respond the way i want on the next page if i put something that says this add ai drops ad cost 52 which it does you should probably use it but the next thing i want them to do if i want to become a high-risk customer is that opt-in to watch a video on this so the next page they go to they're super interested in how this works so what then happens is this peaks their curiosity if they read the subscription right here they get primed to opt in i don't tell them the answer i don't tell them what they're going to get i make them go holy moly i really need to know what this is if i want to move forward in whatever i'm trying to do in my life and this heavily applies to the goal that's very important to me but i'm not selling them or convincing them to use tracking this ad i'm convincing them that they're at a big disadvantage if they're not using this thing i'm talking about then they click the ad and then they're more inclined to opt in and then behave the way i want them to that's what you want to do you don't want to get them to buy you don't want to convince them to change their life here you want to convince them that they need what is going to be on the other side of this page they need to take the next action and what i mean by need to take the next action is we don't say click this add to opt-in no they need to complete whatever happens next in page whatever it is because they're missing this thing in their life that's what you're trying to achieve with the ad copy finally what you need to understand about when you test ad copy is what facebook is going to do is it's not going to run your ads based on which one gets you the most sales and whatnot at least in theory sometimes it works out like that but what it's going to do is it's also going to look at a bunch of factors that don't really have to do with your sales like which one gets the best interaction rate and engagement right that's not always the one that gets you the best results when it comes to sales so what you want to do when you split test your ads is you want to go and make a testing campaign okay and what you want to do in each campaign is you want to have the same exact audience maybe put twenty dollars a day on each audience five ad sets targeting the same audience at 20 days then put five different ads across all those ad sets so if you have five ads one ad in each ad set that is a tongue twister but what you should have is five ad sets and one ad in each ad set that's different and that's how you split test it because it's going to show you your best opt-in rate and your best metrics and that's going to tell you which ad is working the best these are just three fundamental things that people mess up and when you mess these things up you're doing stupid things and you're not going to have good ad results and i want you to have good ad results so that when you scale your ads and you're making a ton of money you're like well i'm losing a ton of money because i'm not tracking my ads right maybe i should use hiros stop being a goblin so let's talk about my three types of ads that i basically run so the first type of ad copy that i run is actually quite simple it's called the peak and click so what i'm going to do right here is i'm going to use curiosity peaking images so check out this image right here these are very simple ads and what i'm going to do is i'm going to try to run ads that look native like a news source so you can see right here this ad ii drops ad costs 52 in some case studies and i have a picture of this woman with tattoos and i have this little chip right here and so what i find works exceptionally well is when you have someone holding something that's weird or you have something that looks weird and is unexplained a lot of people put pictures of like liver or like they used to one thing that used to kill on facebook is people put pictures of like raw eggs and like funny formations and people like what is that now that is spammy you want to have something that ties into this and looks like something someone would put on a new site if you have a picture of yourself next to you in a suit holding crossing your arms no you look like a goober who's trying to sell something on facebook if you have this picture right here it looks like something interesting is happening in the world of technology with combo this with this headline it seems like hmm if you don't read this you're going to be missing out in the world of technology and so what i want to do with these types of ads right here is i want to pique their interest and trigger fomo specifically that's one of my biggest strategies when it comes to anything i'm selling you want to make people particularly feel like they're missing out if they don't know what's going on combine it with the image it catches their attention and a headline that makes them feel like that you're going to get the click now remember you can't just put something like hey people that don't eat this foods head explode all right you'll get a lot of clicks but it doesn't make any sense what's going to happen on the next page it has to relate in what you're doing i'm selling technology and tracking so i want people who are interested in their ads interested in their ad cost to feel like they're missing out and they're not on the cutting edge of technology this gets them to come on to the next page and fomo triggers them and gets them to opt in and go through the rest of the sales funnel fomo is the most powerful thing you can use when you're writing very quick gimmick ads like this i get a click that's relevant because again the criteria is right here ad ai drops ad costs no person who's interested in losing weight is going to click this ad people that are interested in saving money on their ads right away they're going to click this ad because they feel like they're missing out this is the first type of ad copy okay and the most important thing to understand about facebook ad copy as well is i really don't care what's below this fold right here i know some people that will preach and they write their life biography right here most people are going to read this part of the ad they're going to read this part of the ad and they're going to look at the image and click okay so it's very important that you get all your message in before the see more part right here you want to put it in mobile variation and i go and always end it with a here's why or keep reading at this point because yeah this is some good copy right here however the key to it is if you run ads in 2020 you're not using ai tracking scripts you're simply at a huge disadvantage people want to know more i want to see what's going on here so the next type of ad right here is more of a traditional ad something you're probably used to and seeing in the internet marketing world this ad right here which hannaf mohadi absolutely hates you can see the angry emoji right here so here's how you make good video ads make sure the thumbnail i'm using the same exact strategy with the image ad i showed you people like what's going on right here and i put this ai script as the biggest edge in page ads people want to know what's going on right here okay again when you're running video ads make sure to put captions on because people don't turn on sound they just sit there like a brain dead goblin and they read the text i do the same thing i'm a goblin in every four in my life all right so i don't expect other people not to be so what's going to go on in this ad right here is again it's just straight up fomo and what you want to do on videos is a lot of people for example i saw this one person let's just say selling like a youtube or ad consulting course or something like that the person in the video makes this huge case that youtube or facebook ads or their ad strategy the new way to go things are changing like look at my ad manager these are the strategies they're working in 2020 that's not what i want to achieve i want the person to click the ad and go man this guy has something that i need really badly and i want to get them the knee jerk do what i want them to do on the next page and so what i have right here is i'm not telling them about how tracking changes the world or how it's going to improve their scale or how that they're going to see more accurate data in their ad managers it's too much for them to comprehend what i tell them is if you click on the next page i'm going to give you a script that's going to help you save 52 on your ads they click on the next page it says how we use print tracking and ai to save 52 percent of our ads opt-in people go okay that's what i came for that's the thing that their interest they opt in and then they see a sales video that actually does the grinding and the working on explains how sales tracking scripts combined with ai actually do save money on ads and i'm able to actually lay out and hit them with a message because they're not scrolling through instagram they're not scrolling through youtube anymore so what you want to do when you're running these types of video ads especially when you're doing info marketing you want to find the one thing people really care about and what people really care about when it comes to tracking is instantly getting customers much cheaper and so the whole entire ad focuses on if you pay attention to what i'm saying i will give you this thing that gives you that exact result that you want to get and the reason why this result works is because tons of other people say it works look at all these other people that have gotten this result and if you click this ad i will give you the same exact thing that got these people to result okay so that's the format that i use over and over again with my video make sure you have a big enticing headline that matches that strategy i talked about the images go straight into it say look this thing is getting this result that's super important to you and if you don't have this you're missing out you're spending way more money than you should you're doing this x y z thing that causes pain i know this sounds ridiculous but here's tons of other people that have gotten the same exact result and if you click this ad i will give you this exact thing and show you exactly how to use it to get this result click this ad leaves a person with one thing in mind they have the key result that they want which is all you can hook them on you're not going to sell them on a new theory of life they click on the ad they have massive curiosity and they're inclined to do what you want them to do on the next page i want them to opt in so i can really work on them retargeting wise because that's a whole other video you should check out my retargeting video on this channel because that's a whole other beast of a game but that's what i'm trying to do with this type of ad the final type of ad that i like to run is a specific type of retargeting ad and i just want to show you because it's important so when i run retargeting ads again watch my retargeting video on this channel because there's like a zillion other things that i do but one of the things i find is super useful as i make funny retargeting ads why because when people see retargeting ads that they don't care most retargeting ads are like you sitting in there saying like hey you watched my video training and you should be interested in my thing why did you leave i'm so mad and if you want to schedule they didn't schedule call because they didn't like you in the first place okay they didn't they weren't interested and approaching them with like another straight up repeat of what you just said works retargeting wise but if you want to make it better i make funny ads okay i make funny ads that catch your attention make them laugh a little bit and then say hey come on back because we're not trying to convince them to do something again we're trying to get their attention and get them to come back best way to get someone's attention is give them something funny people like reading funny things and so i have all sorts of goofy goofy ads would i retarget people with like mecha reagan raven finds your lack of tracking disturbing people go what's that oh that's that brand with that tracking thing and they're like you know they do get results and then they come on back and then i can work on them again through a sales video we don't want to resell them right here because again you cannot sell to someone who's already on facebook they're doing other things and there's like 16 other things literally scientifically designed to get their attention why would you ever try to make your sales pitch when when the person's being distracted that's like literally trying to go on a date with a girl well there's like 16 other guys all like throwing roses in her face and buying her our drink and then there's just like a chimpanzee screaming in her ear you're probably not it's probably not the next best way to meet your wife that's what i'm trying to say so tip if you're going on hinge or bumble dates try to do it in a room where there isn't 16 other gentleman suitors and by all means avoid that monkey okay that'll lead to a really awkward date and that will probably be feces thrown so that is the lesson for today guys if you like these lessons subscribe to this channel because i'm completing this facebook series and i'm releasing a new video almost every two to three days on this two track your ads you should do it if you're scaling your ads at all and you want to set up that tracking i showed you early video go below this video just track a consultation we'll show you exactly how it works show you where you're losing a ton of money in your ads show you where you can scale and the way high-risk works is if you don't see the results that help you scale make a lot more money you don't pay so you should check it out because the worst thing that could happen is you stop running goblin ads and actually run with accurate data finally if you're interested in that ad mastermind i talked about you can book a call with me below i'll go through your ads we'll analyze your ads look at them i'll show you where you can probably grow the type of funnels you should be running the targeting you should be using and how to
