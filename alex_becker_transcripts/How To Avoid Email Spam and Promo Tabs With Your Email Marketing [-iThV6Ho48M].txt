money and refund guarantee and the subject lines of the emails which is nuts okay that's something I've never been able to do anywhere else and that's something you can do too but what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be sitting down with my head of email um who is actually the genius behind our delivery and everything like that and what we're going to focus on is what you need to know to make sure that you're hitting the inbox every single time these are quick little tips that you can apply in about 30 minutes that will increase your delivery rate all right you get a 10% higher delivery rate you'd make 10% more money okay that's huge for like 30 seconds of work we're going to be focusing also on like headlines to get higher clickr rates and what we're seeing that allows us to hit the Inbox and also get those High open rates from good headlines that actually convert okay so we're going to hop in right now and dive straight into that okay guys so something really funny we did the really demonstrate Market Heroes inboxing and just like how to make sure you inbox like a champ uh our head of email actually just sent these and so you can see right here we actually sent out an email right here and if you know anything about email you know having a headline like this um and then having this content in here uh you can see right here we have Viagra sex porn PayPal wire online bank just this stuff right here they will always get your your email sent to spam and you can say we're still inboxing that with Market hero so that's just kind of a testament to uh how good the delivery is is over here you can just see that the emo right here that went in um I know there's some weird topics right there but that's all the stuff to get you knocked out and we're still hitting the inbox with that um so just just first off right here step one inboxing I suggest you try free trial of Market hero that being said I want to go over a bunch of things that you can do when you're about to email that will drastically drastically drastically improve your inboxing and this is really how you troubleshoot out of the promo tab how you troubleshoot out of the spam tab so the first thing I want to show you kind of how to do is you want to go on a Goog Google and you want to type in SPF record setup tutorial now I'm not going to show you how to do this right here there's there's actually a video of me showing how to do this I'll put it below this video just in a link it's just a really ugly basic video but you can find out how to pretty much do this this anywhere and if you don't know what this is you need to you need to figure this out like right now okay because an SPF record right here is going if you don't have this it doesn't matter if you're using any other autoresponder and this tutorial isn't so much even if you're using Market hero I mean if you're using Market hero you'll still inbox but you still need to do this with Market hero but I want this tutorial to be helpful to you if you're sending emails in general because that's the goal of these videos that provide just as much value so maybe you'll check out the company in the future um so what you want to go is you want to go do this because if you don't do this you're you're going to miss the inbox you're going to hit the promo Tab and you're going to hit the spam box talks a lot and what this does is it basically is a digital signature so when you send out an email from your from email so if I send you an email it's from alexit Market hero.io what's going to happen is when you shoot out the inbox that you sent to is going to check back with the domain you're sending from to make sure this is a validated domain um and so that's really how you can tell what a fake email is from just basically a person using a fake domain they have no authority over so I can go anywhere from be like you know send from alexg google.com and SPS will shoot back to Google and say we don't know this person so that's essentially what it does and what you also want to look into if you really want to improve your with Market her that's pretty much where you have to stop but if you want to look into improving it even more you want to also set up your dkim dkim record as well and this is going to further increase your inboxing if you're sending out a lot of emails right now and you're hitting the promo tab or the spam inbox a lot these two things right here are going to help you dramatically okay D dramatically it's like the the back in the beat DJ version of dramatically right there so next thing I want to get into is making sure your domain itself is not blacklisted for example we had a person hop on about a week ago and they had a big list and they were sending out emails but every single email went to the spaming box and as you can see right here you know delivery like I just showed you in that that picture is not an issue okay once you have your SPF sub but what you're going to notice a lot of times and what you want to check especially if you're seeing this problem and you're consistently in the spam inbox it might be the domain you're sending to in the the account or email you're sending from for example one of my just email addresses long time ago at a website you st just would always hit the spam inbox and it just got blacklisted in Google's Gmail for some reason the way around this was simply changing the email so instead of making it like alexm marketer.com it would be like Bob marketer.com or Alexander marketer.com or IO that's our website so that's another thing you really want to look at right there and that's that's kind step two if you're still hitting the promo Tab and stuff like that and then what I want to show you to do uh inside of here is really how to go out there and troubleshoot your email so what I like to do I'm going to kind of walk you through my entire process is you know first off you want to make sure that you have the SPF set up and so with this email right here I usually send from Chuck's email at Market hero so if you see anything from Chuck that's why I send for him because the the delivery is just so good from this email right here uh when you're sending for Market hero so then what we're going to do right here is I'm just going to select who I'm going to mail to let's just say I'm saying the source wave right now and actually I'll change this to Source wave okay cool now what I do and I don't so do this anymore at Market hero because um it hits the inbox regardless of what I do I could put free money in the title it still hits the inbox but what I want to do is let me just go pick an email right here that has um maybe some money let me just type in money right here let's find one that has like money in the key the headline there all right so here we go right here so here's an email basic one right here to get sent out and I want to show you how to really troubleshoot these emails if you hit the promo tab or the spam inbox so there's a series of tests that I do when I'm sing at a test email I'm sending to myself so if I send out a test email or I send a test email out to myself and I see it hit the promo tab or the inbox the largest culprit is probably going to be your subject so the first thing I'm going to do right here is I'm going to put in um I'm going to change the the subject line to basic subject line okay so I'm just going to make it so that there's zero reason why the title would be a reason for us not to hit the inbox okay and so what's going to happen first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to hit that and I'm going to send that to myself again okay and when that goes and hits uh the promo tab again I know okay cool it's not the headline it's something in the content of the email there's just sometimes where a section of your email is going to cause that so the next caller that's going to happen right here is probably going to be your images okay so again with Market hero if you're sending stuff in the image area uh if you're sending images you're going to inbox anyways but if you're using other R SM you're probably going to run into this where if you send an image a lot lot of times it's going to hit the promo tab it's almost the difference between hitting the inbo and the promo tab a lot of time so all you need to do is just simply remove the image okay just remove the image send out the email see if that's the reason it didn't hit okay and if you're still hitting the promo tab it has to be something in your text okay and there's a lot of ways you can get around this okay so words like you know free money uh income all this all the stuff to Chuck run in there what I like to do or what I used to do when I was at another odd responder and I'm not I'm not going to pick fun at other OD responders I do that enough but what I would do is I'd find sub subs for these words basically words that mean the same thing and people read them the same way but they don't trigger the same spam response okay so what I'll do is I'll first actually go through and I'll look at certain sections that might trigger it off so I'm look at this one right here if any of them have dollars on your online business right here so what I would do is I delete this section and then send out the email again okay and if it's still in the promo tab it's not that section I just gradually remove sections uh until there's nothing left in the email okay and this is a pain usually you're going to hit hit the inbox by this time but if you're not right there when you get to the section that is knocking you out of the inbox okay uh and if just by the way if you if you have a normal email and it goes out and hits the promo tab there's something wrong with your domain you're sending from or the autoresponder you're sending from it's more than likely your domain there's no autoresponder out there that can't hit the inbox with a proper email um so once you realize which part of it is knocking you out of inbox just put a quick note down like put the put the subject of the paragraph somewhere in the text file so you can kind of see stuff that c es the promo tab from your autoresponder so what I do a lot of times when I'm writing my emails just to avoid this the first time around is when I say when I want to say free in the email I'll say no cost okay when I want to talk about money I'll say bucks or buckaroos okay I I'll use slang for money instead of using the word dollars or money or stuff like that okay when I say income I'll talk about you know um you know I something generated income actually works pretty well um like a lot of people will say money generated and stuff like that um or you know how much money you make a year I'm going to say it will increase your income um it will increase stuff like that so one thing you want to do when you're thinking about writing out emails and stuff like that um what what I could do like if you want I'm just saying if you like want to type in like porn or something I'm not saying you're going to type in porn I just want to show you how you want to think about you put in maybe you know adult videos okay or something like that you want to change the words around whatever you're doing so that was a weird example actually way to offend everybody but like payday loans okay like if you put in like payday loans into whatever you're typing out out there you could put in something instead of like get the bucks on the same day okay that's not like proper English but you can see how like I go in and kind of describe with this type of loan okay you can see that's that's really a weird way of saying payday loans but I want you to take away that there's ways you can change the text to get out of the promo Tab and still get your message across in your email so you know these are just some tips right here and this is exactly the process I go to to make sure I hit the inbox every single time because when you hit the inbox if you get a 20% 30% higher inboxing rate uh you make more money you make 30% more money it's one of the easiest things you can do to increase the income your business makes that being said um if you want to get this like I showed you before you know we're inboxing with the titles free money and putting images and all sorts of stuff in our emails you know Market hero does that if you have your SPF set up correctly but you know if you're on other I responders this is a process you should probably be going through and you need to set your SPF no matter where where you're at okay a lot of a responders don't make people do that when they come inside um we do and the reason for that is because you know a lot of a SPS want people get in with least resistance as possible but there's a downside to that it kills their delivery it makes their IPs just awful so uh that's exactly what I do and that's what we require at Market here so we keep our IPS really clean and delivering good so this is just a quick little checklist if you're interested in getting this type of delivery just try the free trial below this video uh and if not stay where you're at and use these tips to go and increase your delivery so this has been Becker and I will see you around the general vicinity of Market hero okay take it easy
