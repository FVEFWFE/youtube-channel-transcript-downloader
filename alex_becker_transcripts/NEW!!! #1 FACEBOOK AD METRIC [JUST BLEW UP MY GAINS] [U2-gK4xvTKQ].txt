================================================================================

you're about to see the one metric to rule them all in fact if you just alter this metric in your facebook ad account and ignore everything else you are going to see plummeting ad costs and much much higher rois on your ads no hyperbole this works nearly every single time i do it any person i show it to it works for them as well and this right here is perfect for you if you look at your ad accounts and you see all the stats like cpc and cpm and bpm and rpg as well as dps you got to have high dps in your your facebook accounts okay that way you can get sweet loot by killing the raid bosses the nerds got that joke anyways you probably look at all the stats in your ad managers and you're like whoa cpc went up or a cpm went up and i don't know what's going on and everything skyrocketed or went this way this this is the fix to all of that and will allow you to get your cpc cpm everything at dirt cheap levels and it will just be easy for you to do so instead of talking this up anymore let me just show you and by the way hit the like button hit the notification bell and subscribe i release these videos every monday wednesday and friday and on this ad channel unlike other ad channels i don't teach you one fourth of what i do and then sell you a course i have no course to sell you i want you to grow your business and make more money so that you buy hiros my ad tracking company do make you more money and the best way for me to get you to buy hiros so you can make more money with hiros is simply just give you everything i know because then you'll buy highers and even upgrade your account because you're making so much more money from the attackers i give you like this one right here okay guys let's just get going and i guarantee again if you apply what i'm going to show you in this video you're going to see such better metrics and get all the things you're looking to achieve cheaper clicks cheaper cpms dramatically reduce your ad costs this works nearly every single time and that's not me being hyperbolic when i help people in my mastermind do this and they stop thinking like i'm about to show you it nearly always works so let me show you what i'm talking about right here what i'm looking at right here is usually the number one sign that a media buyer is about to get really really lost don't get me wrong this is actually a spreadsheet that i'm pretty sure this media buyer captured from one of my friends sam evans now sam evans and his team are like literal data scientists so this stuff can actually work for them i never use it but i i know it's helped him the thing is what most people do when they're buying facebook ads is for example sam's business which uses this is like a 20 million dollar per year business people that are making a hundred thousand two hundred thousand less than a million dollars a year even less than five million dollars per year they'll go in and they'll start adopting this type of data scientist strategy and what happens is they end up trying to control all these little metrics right here and i want to tell you something about these metrics you can't control any of them directly your cpc is controlled by facebook your your ad spend your impressions your cpm these are all these are all indicators of something else that is you can't actually control for example if you want to control the speed you're going on your car you don't look at the mile per hour you don't look at the rpms you don't look at the battery you just look at your gas pedal and you press down and the thing you need to focus on if you want to make the car go faster is not the readings aka the mile per hour the rpms etc you want to actually focus on how hard you're pressing down on the gas pedal i know that doesn't make much sense so let me explain this if you look at my ads i've clearly identified the gas pedal and that is going to be my cpl my cost per call and my roi if you go and look at my ad accounts the only columns i really ever have showing are these things i will occasionally look at these stats that i'm mentioning right here when something has gone terribly wrong but these stats still don't help i usually use this to look for glitches or something that's broken okay for example if my cpc skyrockets or something like that i i haven't literally looked at these things though in years so again i don't even want to use that example but why alex why do you only look at these things shouldn't you be looking at all these things and trying to micro bid and optimize here's what you need to understand let's just look at a simple metric like cpl now you have to break down what actually leads to your key metrics and then what actually controls things like cpa cpc and cpm there's all sorts of other crazy stats that people look at i'm just going to focus on those two because they're just the easiest to explain okay and if you're new cpc is cost per click cpm is the cost for how many 1 000 impressions you're getting so if facebook shows your ad to a thousand people and you pay 21 dollars for that that's your cpm but you have to understand cpl is a reflection of metrics that are then also reflections of your cpc and cpm so cpl is the top level metric and by focusing on that the thing that controls your cpl is actually going to be your ad click-through rate your ad engagement and going to be your opt-in rate at that point all right there's many other ones out there but for example your ad click-through rate is going to be controlled and your ad engagement is going to be controlled by two things actually one thing how engaging your damn ad is okay and these two things are first off how many people watch your ad and how many people click your ad you're probably thinking no duh obviously alex but what you need to understand right here is that if you want to get a low cpl what we're going to focus on instead is not going and altering the ad click-through rate and the engagement we're going to focus on lowering the cpl by focusing on the thing that controls all this the ad itself okay we don't ever i don't ever look at these metrics right here what i'm gonna look at is i'm gonna go upload an ad and i'm gonna look at which one gets the lowest cpl uh across the same opt-in page now follow along with me right here if the cpl is lower automatically that means the ad click-through rate and ad engagement are better every single time because i know that in the sub of this an ad that has a high ad click-through rate and a high ad engagement also has a lower cpc and thus because of the engagement has a lower cpm but again i'm not looking at these right here i'm going to only look at the cpl because again the cpl is a symptom of these things and these things are a symptom of these things and so what you can do is you can cut out all of these charts right here you can cut out all this excessive data that's going to confuse you and lead you to an action you can just focus on one metric the cpl because as you focus on the cpl let's imagine we haven't optimized the opt-in page or our sales page uh or the shopify e-com landing page the landing on or the call funnel okay let's imagine we haven't optimized that yet your cpl is naturally going to tell you the ad that has the best ad click-through rate and the best engagement and thus the best cpc and cpm and by focusing only on cpl you're moving all these things in the direction you want to anyways so instead of that i'm going to upload five ads and i'm just going to look purely at the cpl don't move the cpl i can guarantee you 99 is going to have the best metrics that's it and so then what i'm going to do to reduce cpl is focus on the overall thing which is the ad itself and the ad itself is actually controlled by how many people watch it and how it speaks to them and so i'm going to focus on the ad message not the metrics at all i'm going to focus on what message i see so if i have five ads and they all five say something a little bit different i'm gonna look at the one that gets the best cpl thus gets the best of these things i'm not gonna repeat them anymore and then what i'm gonna say is oh that message is what people respond to and then i'm gonna make five more ads around that message and then see which one of those ones people respond to the most and say oh okay this message out of the five out of this message gets the most powerful response and that's how i'm gonna go out there so instead of actually even focusing on the cpl i focus on the add message and this is how you drive all these to the floor then what i'm going to do is i'm going to go and apply this add message to the opt-in and then try five or six different opt-ins that have a different version of this message right here and so then i'm gonna get the opt-in right so let's imagine right here we started off with a cpl of let's say 15 okay and this 15 cpl is actually your ad click-through rate engagement all these things right here contributing to this so what i'm going to do first is i'm going to focus on the add messages and get this cpl down to let's say nine dollars by focusing only on the ad message not the opt-in page yet if the opt-in page let's imagine it has a 10 opt-in rate right here all right a 10 conversion rate 10 something okay whatever we're trying to do get calls or whatnot so i'm going to use purely my ad messaging and using the cpl to tell me which ad is the best message ignoring these other stats so once i get this down to nine dollars or i'm gonna say all right that looks really good now what i'm going to do is i'm going to try and get this opt-in up to 30 or 40 percent or increase my conversion rates on the page by uh three to four x which is very very very doable on your first version of anything your first version is usually going to have so much room to be optimized to again just look at the cpl and i'm going to try and get this cpl down to three dollars by purely focusing on the opt-in and that right there is going to in turn make my business significantly more profitable if i take my cpl from fifteen dollars or my cost per any acquisition i'm looking for from fifteen dollars to three dollars my business just 5xed in profitability ish all right and i'm off if i'm off a little bit there just because i don't do math in these videos that's not my strong suit getting ad messages is this right here is by far the best way to improve your ads versus this excessive over analyzation this is something that your mind can understand right here i can easily focus on cpl and i can easily focus on the message of the ad i can control that and think about it super clearly i cannot look at this chart and make clear simple decisions and this is what most media buyers do they they come to this and they try to they try to do it like the stock market okay we look at all these metrics and whatnot uh all the billion things that are going on try to make a call but the thing is the stock market is not under your control the cryptocurrency market is not under your control so you need to sometimes do all this over analyzation okay in theory i guess your ads are literally under your control so you don't need to do this you can literally just go in and focus on one key metric now the last thing i want to focus on is i always like to look at the upfront metrics so that's going to be your cost per call cost per uh lead cost per call is cpc that i'm referring to right here or cop cpa so cost per sale or something if you're doing ecom okay but these aren't always the best thing to look at especially cost per call and cost per lead because the main thing is actually roi we want to get these things as low as possible to tell us to to basically control the add metrics so these things right here are going to control all these metrics that we're looking at right here okay they're going to be symptoms of all these metrics at least the roi at the end of the day though is the number one most important thing and i want to show you this by looking at the stats right here from just hiros and google ads okay you can see right here the cost per call on these right here is actually really good this one is great 49 cost per call i can come in verify look at the stats and hire see exactly who's booking calls and who's coming in so the cost of a call is looking amazing on both of these actually 200 cost per call is amazing but you can see if i optimize for cost per call this is a weird instance right here where the cost recall also lines up with the profit but you can see that these calls right here didn't generate me a profit these ones did this is actually tracking that's impossible to do in google ads because these are being closed over the phone and i'm tracking this with hiros again i hate to show highrose in these videos actually i don't it will just improve your business immensely and the point of these videos is to help your business so much that you're eventually going to be like hmm i'd like to improve it more with hiros we literally guarantee you'll get these results and be able to grow your ads you don't pay for it so i have no problem showing it to you because frankly it just works but tying into this lesson right here if you are optimizing just around cpl or cpc and not around profits what happens all the time is people look at everything except their profits and then what they do is they go and scale up ads they're actually unprofitable in roi terms but they look amazing in cpl and cpc this is chronic so don't do that as well this is a lesson for today guys to wrap it all up what you want to do is you want to understand that your cpl or your main metrics are symptoms of all these other metrics but if you focus on the symptom it's not like the doctor's office right here which is usually going to then be controlled by your ad messaging and then your landing page we want to focus on the messaging first because the landing page can artificially drive this up and down focus on the messaging first because that will then control this and this will just control every other stat okay or will we be a reflection of every other stat and if we just keep our minds simple focus on the ad message to lower cpl this will lower everything else and then once we've lowered cpl enough without focusing on the landing page or funnel then we focus on the landing page and funnel to lower it even more to get our ads to massive profitability this is the best way to do this and my iron mastermind whenever students stop doing this okay and again i'm not hating on this for example my friend sam evans i massive respect for him he's a genius i have not seen this work for many of people it might work for people in his mastermind or whatnot i usually see people get way better results in my mastermind by doing this okay so it depends on who you are and maybe what you want to look at but nine out of 10 times simplifying everything to a point where your mind can easily get it is going to deliver better results for you speaking of which check out the links in the description right here you could book a call with me you can literally see the results i've gotten six seven and eight figure results by moving their business to youtube and improving their facebook ads you can go check that out book a call with me i'll tell you exactly how to do it for your business as well you could even join the mastermind if you're a good fit that being said in these videos this is the lesson for today i share everything i know in these videos because frankly i want you to grow your business to the point where you need highrose so i don't hold anything back i don't have anything subtle to sell you here and that's why you should subscribe because i release videos like this every monday wednesday and friday and you'll see them when they go live and it'll be
