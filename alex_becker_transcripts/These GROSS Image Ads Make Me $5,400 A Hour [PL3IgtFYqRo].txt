================================================================================

hello there do you run Facebook Google ads or maybe even put up YouTube videos and no one clicks your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well it's likely because you're ugly and I can't fix that you're a 5 fo2 Goblin your ugly parents produced an ugly kid it's not going to happen I pity you hence why I'm making this video right now to give you the blueprint I use for images across Facebook ads Google ads and YouTube videos to get better results than videos you're probably running video ads on Google and Facebook and you're not getting the clickthrough rates you want this image added blue PR right here beats videos right now you are going to get cheaper clicks you're going to get people to your site at a much lower cost and they're going to convert much higher in fact I've been replacing most of my video ads with this and you can listen to me on this because I've been running ads for almost a decade and built multiple eight figure businesses in fact I built One n figureure business all fueled by ads and if you need proof what I'm about to show you works you can check out my YouTube channels not just this one but my one in crypto that have reached millions of followers and the reason why they're able to do this is because I'm exceptionally good at getting those red hot clicks my thumbnail and headline system I'm going to give you right here will allow you to slap an image in a headline anywhere on planet Earth magazines Facebook ads heck even at your cousins Bar Mitzvah and people will not only just click it but they will buy in higher volumes or do whatever the heck you want them do watch a video stay on the page read the sales copy opt in I don't give a f you'll get them to do it with these image ads and as an added perk you won't even have to make video ads anymore you can just be a lazy piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] load up Ms paint slap some crap down and you get higher click-through rates than all your friends they'll be very impressed they'll come to you and go wow that's great that that's a great click-through rate you got there and you'll be like yes I F know I copied Alex Becker his works so without further Ado I'm going to get into this and this is something you have to learn because what I'm seeing at hos right now and if you don't know I'm the CEO of one of the largest ad tracking companies on the entire planet is I'm seeing image ads taking over and actually replacing video ads in many instances and like I said before if you know how to do this you're going to get a lot cheaper you're going to get people to your site a lot cheaper you're going to be able to put in no effort because you're using image ads which is fantastic we're all for that here we're all lazy saxs as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you'll be able to stand out cuz everybody's using video ads and ugc ads right now this right here is different so let me break it down so let's begin now it goes without saying after a person clicks the ad a lot of other things importantly have to happen okay they have to go through the right funnel they have to go through the Right video Sal scripts there's different video ad scripts you can actually use to set up these ads better on YouTube and Google the targeting the whole hoopla there's a lot more to advertis than just making cool sexy images we get it which is why below this video my exact ad funnels my ad scripts my ad targeting the exact type of procs and type of funnel I like to use it's all here on YouTube listed below so after this video and throughout this video I'm going to mention a few other tactics which you can watch below it's all given away totally for free I have no info products or education course or Mastermind to sell you I'm already extremely rich I don't have to do that my only hope here is that if I help you make more money with this content via your ad you're going to think to yourself maybe I should track my ads maybe I shouldn't run my ads like a drunken baboon because if I track where my sales come from accurately I'm going to be able to optimize my ads and then get more of those sales cheaper that's common [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sense we all know this when you make more money from this content I'm going to give you you're going to come and use my company hyros to track your ads to thus make more money from your ads we in fact guaranteed or you don't pay for hyros so that's my theory here I hope it works out so let's talk about these image ads and why we want to be doing this so on top of giving you my exact blueprint right here that works on YouTube it works on Facebook it works on Google heck you can probably copy this over to Tik Tok if you want but imats has some very unique uh benefits the first one being you can be a lazy sack of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and make these work you don't have to shoot video ads you don't have to do anything and these are actually beating video ads in many instances the clickr rates and people looking at them is just it's better in a lot of instances the reason for that is with image ads you're really able to get your entire message across and less than five seconds which is going to get the click okay and this is super important in many instances because getting the click is 90% of the battle getting the attention and expressing everything is 90% of the battle so this is why I think it's been working a lot better and then three it stands out so right now everybody's doing video ads I'm sure as you scroll through Facebook heck I can go do it right now if we look through the video you actually see one of my ads right here's the video at ignore that but you can see they all blend together into one just giant hoopla of something you've seen seen before nobody's really running images right now and if you notice when you drive through you stop to look at images like this a lot like stuff like this you don't look at this you look at stuff like this stuff like this like this is what gets people to look at stuff on social media right now people's attention spans are so short that image ads really played this better than even a 5-second 10-second video ad so let's go through the steps to making a really good image now the cool thing about image is you can Mass split test them very easily you can change the colors you can change the text of them rapidly it gives you an advantage you wouldn't naturally have in video ads but I want to show you this technique being used in the most high stakes form of image ads to Art which is YouTube thumbnails because when you put up a video on YouTube you have one shot at the headline you have one shot at the thumbnail yeah there's some split testing features on YouTube but they're dog they don't work so you really have to get it right the first time meaning you got to know what you're doing and so what I want to walk you through through is the techniques I use for thumbnails on this channel and my other channel and as you can see my channels greatly outperform other channels if you look at crypto channels for example the average views there is probably like 50 to 100K I get about 500,000 views per video if you look at this Channel and advertising the average view on channels in this space is about 3,000 5,000 views we're getting 20 50,000 views a video right now I'm going to explain to you why this is happening because if you understand this you can make phenomenal video and images jzs and you can also apply this to your YouTube so there's three steps to this one there's the trigger okay and what the trigger is is what gets the person's eyes on the image and what we want to do is we want to disturb the person in some way okay whether this can be making them mad giving them a punchable face which I'm going to talk about here in a second turning them on a little bit to playing a little bit with their dopamine systems making them feel judged shamed or some type of emotion we have to put an image on here that makes them feel some type of emotion whether it's disgust Amusement interest it has to be something that triggers them okay then what we're going to do is we're going to create curiosity not just curiosity but targeted curiosity all right if I wanted to get everyone's attention on YouTube and get them to click I could make a thumbnail with a a girl with a big rack and put she made 6 million on only fans this month everybody would click that not only are they triggered by the picture of the hot girl but then they have the story right here how the heck do she make $6 million and they're all thinking I hate her so they're all going to click it but then when I start talking about advertising on my video Channel or talking about cryptocurrency they're not going to watch it so we have to find a way not just to trigger curiosity and interest to get the click but we have to get the right people clicking and then finally we have to create a story with a headline that must be completed if the person is our target market okay so what I mean by this is I can create anything a story like hey girl makes 6 million on only fans how did that happen that that's great that's going to get a click but that story headline isn't something that's necessarily going to need to be completed by our target market for example at hyos I have to not only catch a person's attention but I have to catch the attention of someone that's interested in running advertising if I'm going to run these ads I have to trigger their curiosity and then I have to create a story that a person who run runs ads will then click on which is again actually being able to run your ads correctly and makeone from them and make a much higher Roi from your ads which again I'm not going to shamelessly shill you hyros too much in this video but I don't see how you expect to make ads work when you can see right here if I'm tracking calls just for hyros right here on this one ad account you can see in this example Facebook caught 32 calls hyros tracking caught 61 Facebook tracking caught two calls hyros tracking caught nine you can see tracking is off on Facebook and Google by 50 100% in some instances Base number one thing you have to do if you're running ads is know where the sales are coming from so you can turn off ads that are not working and clearly see the ads that are and then scale them up with your true numbers if you're not doing that you're wasting are losing 20 30 40% of your potential profit from ads so please as I teach you this image technique that's going to make you more money from your ads you should go and make even more money from your ads by not running them like a drunken pirate and actually being able to track your real results and real numbers so you can actually scale these things so let's talk about this thumbnail on our Biz roids channel that just did very well okay and this applies to all the thumb THB nails they on my crypto videos and everything this is the core concept right here so why does thumbnail do very well there's three things that are happening right here there's the trigger there's the Curiosity triggering text in the image and then there is the headline what a lot of people do when they're running their image ads or creating any images is they try to do they don't try to do these steps in order and they try to convey way too much um at a time without actually uh engaging the target so they're going to put images that try to tell the story their their headline text is going to try and convey way too much information or it doesn't convey the right information and their headline doesn't trigger a click you have to use each part of the image as its own targeted sniper like action so if you look at this image we have to start with the trigger the trigger is Whatever Gets the person's eyeballs there so in a lot of examples right here what I like to do in my videos for example is I like to make a very punchable face okay whenever I used to watch YouTube there was this like 18-year-old YouTuber had like broccoli hair genen Z as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] very annoying looking kid and he'd always have faces like this in his videos and I wanted to punch him at all times but what was the result I'd stop I'd look at him I'd hate him and then I'd look at the damn thumbnail and then I would go and look at the headline and I click his video and I at least watch it for a few minutes it worked the kid was getting millions of views in the marketing space so that story aside what I'm going to try and do with all my videos is I like to give them a punchable face that just works for me what happens is a person sees this and they get triggered they feel a little bit of anger resentment some type of negative emotion that gets them to then read the story of the ad now for triggers you don't just have to use a punchable face you can use for example if you ever saw those images ads back in the day there'd be a picture of like this weird farmer um you know with his shirt off in a field and it would say like the IRS hates him he found a way to break the system once for all and Escape taxes on his farm something like that the trigger on that was the weird guy with the Pitchfork and that that ad sounds so played out and so generic because it worked for so long for a decade you could just run that ad and make money okay and it used the same exact format we're going through right here so what you want to do is you want to use some image that triggers them another good example that doesn't involve faces or people is I saw a weight loss ad and they got like a bunch of eggs egg yolks all together and they put them all together so it looked like fat or something and then they put like that in the image and that Drew people's eyeballs to the image because it was disgusting to look at so I want you to think about you're going to have to split test this and use different things and certain triggers will work better than others but think about what image can I put in my ad that will draw a person's eyeballs to the image first that's priority number one get the eyeballs on the ad the face right here Eyes eye contact also very important because people are drawing the faces and eye contact that all works very well obviously you could go and throw like a hot woman or something on here but what I'd also suggest with these triggers is don't use something that they see repeatedly for example if you put hot babes in your ass everybody's seen hot babes and it's not probably going to create the best thing for your brain so think about this split test different triggers now what I want to do with the text as well is I want to do a few things I want to trigger them create some type of emotion and then I want to create a story a provocative story that they then must get the answer to all right or creates a question in their head creates a question in their head pequs their curiosity and I must make sure it's getting the right people so let's look at this headline right here hey stupid obviously triggering run sexual ads obviously the sexual word right here triggering okay um it's very provocative these two parts right here create a very provocative statement that gets the person hooked okay but then when we say run sexual ads then sell this this calls out my target market right here obviously this makes it very clear that this video that they're going to see is going to be about advertising and selling things so what I've done is I've captured the attention of everybody I've created a provocative story that then appeals only to my target audience and then reels my target audience in this is the goal of the headline that's in the image all right there's a headline that goes below the image that it's about to get the click but what we're trying to do right here is we're trying to get their curiosity peaked and filter them and make it provocative so they actually are interested like their curiosity is very peaked out this statement right here creates a lot of curiosity now this is finished by the headline of this video which is I explain an ad funnel that makes me $72,000 a day and so what does this headline right here that is going to go below the video I'm sure you've seen ads on Facebook and gole Google I'm sure you've seen YouTube videos you're watching one right now you you look at that headline last and that headline what it does is it creates the story that they then must click to finish I explain an ad phunnel that makes me $72,000 a day so what has happened I caught the person's attention I hooked their curiosity and filtered them to make sure my target audience and then I presented them with a story that they must complete this ad funnel make $72,000 what's the ad phone how do it work that's an extreme amount of money how is he doing this and that's the end position I want my target user in they're going to click and then they're going to watch the video now of course the video then has to heavily relate to the story and all the imagery I put right here of course the ad has to relate to that and for example you really want to make sure that your image ads and your landing pages line up using what I like to call the sell a pizza get a pizza technique that is broken down below under this video it shows how you can make your ads relate very heavily and pre-sell your landing pages to dramatic i al increased conversion so watch that video below this it's incredibly useful for this technique I'm giving you right here but you can see those three steps have been accomplished and if we go over to my YouTube channel you can see if we go look at my most popular videos recently you can see I'm using this technique over and over and over again all right so if we go look at one video that did really well like don't run ads to poor people you can see right here what am I doing trigger punchable face hey stupid don't run ads to poor people what is that very provocative very obnoxious and it's it mentions ads it filters the target audience in and then I explain an ad tactic that made me 150 million at 30 super engaging story let's look at it in crypto okay let's look at this technique used over there and then we're going to hop over to add accounts and break this down for advertising so let's look at some of my best converting videos right here so obviously you can see I'm using similar faces over here you can see I'm using the same technique across the board and you can see when I'm not using a triggering face look at this one right here the face isn't is triggering it's kind of boring okay doesn't not as many views okay not as many views right here so you can see that pattern kind of playing out right here now what's happening right here hey stupid dump Bitcoin buy these very triggering image triggering provocative headline in the text sell Bitcoin these seven crypto coins will 23x by 2025 with a story that then a person that's interested in cryto crypto investing must engage in now let's look at a few other things with these images before we actually hop over to ad images what are what's going on in these images you can see how I am using a very simple background in the images because I want the text and the face to stand out we don't need goodlooking images you can actually see on my business Channel a lot of the images like still have pixels around them it's just because I go in Photoshop rip out the background shuck it out there no effort you don't need the images to look good what we need to do is remember how the person's eyes work and what our goals are we want to get them to our trigger that's it we don't want them to look at a pretty AG go wow this this guy's a great designer we want to lock their eyes eyes locked okay then we want to drag their eyes to the image headline dump Bitcoin big red titles right here okay they go this is what's going to attract them right there then they're going to see hey stupid and buy these that's how their eyes are going to work when they look at this they're going to go hey stupid dump Bitcoin buy these buy what and then they go to the headline because they need more information sell Bitcoin these seven cryptos whatever all right you can see where it's going from here and you can see this this this strategy has been repeated over and over and over again now a few of the things are going on right here if you notice on the face in the trigger I make sure to make it stand out I make it very bright overc contrasted I've gone and made the eyes even deeper blue to drink people's face uh uh attension in I I go and also increase the brightness around the eyes so people's eyes and everything come in and some really good channels you can look at for inspiration for thumbnails Beast mister or Mr Beast if you look at Mr Beast thumbnails he's like the master of doing this when it comes to images so what he's doing the exact same technique but what he's doing right here let me make sure you can see this is for entertainment videos I don't think that headline in the image works as as good as um it does in info or business or infotainment type videos I do like so for example crypto or business videos I want to use text in the image for entertainment videos you can see what Mr Beast does really well right here is again all the things I talk about when it comes to the face all right he lures you in with the face you see the face right here ion overcasted face even if it wasn't his face on there this would reel you in all right obviously because you he has his face in there it's going to get a little bit more attention but same exact concept okay you can even see this face is a little bit triggering it's a little bit like there's something off about it it brings you in all right it triggers you then you can see he tells a story a provocative story with the image in the background you can see this ship right here and then this golden ship it looks crazy it it creates this this curiosity what's going on here the same way the text and my images does then $1 versus $1 million yacht it's a story that you must complete if we go to Alex Heros Channel you're going to see the same exact tactics and Alex is very very well um as far as business videos go so when you look at his videos especially his most popular ones that do the best okay um let's go find his most popular videos all right you can see how he's doing the same exact thing in two different ways so here's the Mr Beast effect right here you got the triggering face you got the money in the background there's some story being told here why is he upset why is he why is he angry why is there money in the background okay same exact thing what really does well here and a really good example of just the text one that I really prefer for ads and info based channels as you can see he has the face right here there's some story it triggers you in it pulls you in why is what's why is his expression like this obviously Alex's brand is a little bit different than mine mine is provocative triggering and obnoxious his is not so he's not using the same type of punchable face but you can see this sell to the rich right here this is very true triggering right here this is this is a triggering headline right here obviously it's going to attract people that want to sell things and want to make more money and then he has a story right here in the headline you can see how everything works one point at a time so now that you've seen this pattern over and over again let's apply it to ads now the same process works on Google ads Facebook ads anywhere you put up an image with a headline combination this is where it works now the reason why I covered YouTube ads so much is because that's the highest Stakes highest level of this technique when it comes to paid ads you can split test 50 different images 5050 different headlines 50 different triggers you really you really can get it wrong and you just have to get it right once with YouTube you have to get the thumbnail right you have to get the headline right or the video doesn't do well and you just wasted 30 minutes making the video and all you can only upload so many times per week you only put up two to three images so when you're looking at the video thumbnails and headlines on YouTube that is the Super Bowl that is the UFC of image ad creating okay so once we move move over to ads themselves it's far easier because we can test everything so let's look at one of my ads on hyos it does super well this thing craps money it does great now I'm going to give you one little tip before we talk about this I find that image ads work particularly well for retargeting ads because the person already knows your brand and they know about you now there's two different types of image ads we want to use whether we're using cold ads or we're using retargeting ads which I'm going to get into in this so what I'm going to to do is this is a cold traffic ad this is meant for people that don't know what hyros is so you can see what do we got going on right here the thing that I've done wrong in this ad is this image is not triggering this is actually a bad ad and I'm pretty sure I can make this better by making this image better how would I do this what I'd use is the hyros dashboard but I'd put in weird images like show like an ad manage or dashboard maybe put in weird images like a creepy face or you know boobs or something that looks like a turd this is just me being an iMat goof right here but there's all sorts of weird things you can put in a software dashboard to draw someone's eye in you can see how I'm going to use something that's going to trigger people the same way now you can see I'm using the text to create a curiosity Peak that is filtered my ads are scaling so fast I had to take a damn loan one thing I want to point out is I Ed the word Dam in this why using little slight cursives catches attention better General tip for you my ads are scaling so fast I had to take a damn loan it's a triggering statement it's not as controversial or crazy as my um as my YouTube videos but it has the same effect on someone that's running ads why are they scaling so fast why do you have to take a damn loan what what am I missing right here I wish my ads were scaling all this works together so you can see the image drags the person's eye in okay the text right here creates curiosity then they're going to go and check these headlines to figure out what the heck is going on can't scal your ads in 153 test it increased ad scale by 15.3% here's how the big and more important one right here is new data plus AI grew ad scale 15.3% on average this is going to trigger anybody that is interested in making more money in their ads to click this ad and then they're going to go to the page and the whole other marketing tactics like the video sales or the videos that I have selling the copywriting on the page the funnel I'm using which are all linked Below in this video go to the description it's all there that's where all that's going to come into play but you can see the same exact pattern being used I use in my YouTube videos and there's even ways we can systematically see how to improve this because the whole point is getting the hooked creating curiosity getting them to this headline right here and on to the next page and this headline here new data plus AI grows ad scale or grew ad scale by 15.3% on average the person is going to click to complete this story right here and by the way if you're interested in that again yes hyros does that and we guarantee it or you don't pay for it you can see literally in this ad right here as I'm using this hus tracking is beating Facebook tracking as much as 200% in some instances right here if you're not using accurate stats you're running your ads like a drunk baboon so bonus tip actually track where your sales are coming from if you're using base tracking it's not going to cut it you're losing so much money for no reason so again maybe track your ads but you can see the same exact tactic being used right here that we use on YouTube it works this thing beats a lot of our video ads so to wrap things up let's look at one other image ad that works very very well this works well on gdn it works well on Facebook ads say crush it for us and this is a different type of image ad but it's not too different I just want to point out a few things that are key here so this is a remarketing ad for people that already know what hus is and one of the best things you can do when it comes to advertising is using image ads to people that have visit your website almost like an email list because they're so cheap to run you can hit these people so targetedly and you can also dominate places that most people aren't running Adge which is the side areas on Facebook and then gdn people aren't running ads very aggressively or at the same rate that they are as they are video ads that are in stream on YouTube and Instagram that's just what people all lean towards so what's going on here I think you can already tell me if you've been watching this video triggering face brings the person in this is too much ands soon the one caveat here is people already know who I am or they've they've already been the hyos and they don't need to be told what hyos does they don't need to be filtered the fact that they've already been on the H highis website means they're my target audience so I'm not doing the filtering I'm just creating a provocative headline right here this is too much ands soon what's too much it's too soon why does Alex look like he has to poop these all things trigger the person in and get them to read the point of the ad 30% off hos pre- Black Friday prep sale the entire point of the ad is to get them to read this right here they already know what hyros is they already probably know if they're interested or not and all I really need to do is get them to click right now so what I'm doing is I'm not explaining hey this AI improves results or anything like that what I'm doing is I'm saying literally if you've been interested in this it's time to click now and you can see I'm using the same pattern just to express different things it's not about following in a cookie cutter way it's about understanding the pattern itself trigger the person reel them in create a headline or something story that they become curious about use the headline or the final headline text to reel them in On promotional ads or direct ads I like to just use a big straightup click now headline like this one to really bring the person in I'm not really going to rely on this headline or the description too much because we don't need to the the point of the that is much more simple the person's a lot further along the sales process already and so that in this long-winded video is exactly why and how I run image ads I think this is probably one of the most powerful techniques you can use because you can spit out image ads so quickly you can text or test all the colors the headlines images super quickly and if you use them correctly in this pattern I'm going to show you they will beat video ads a lot of the times and allow you to give a have at least a good mix of video ads and image ads which you want to have you don't want to just have purely video ads so this is everything this video has already gone way too long I don't have anything else to say if you want to see the funnels I'm running link below this video if you want to see the exact scripts I use on my video ads as the worked and sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of product at this point they're below as well if you want to see how I make my video sales videos and all the stuff that happens on the page the funnels themselves after that has clicked it's right below this video I have nothing else to say see you next video
