hey what's going on this is alex becker and in this super quick 5-minute video i'm not only going to show you how to set up your market hero app on your Shopify store I'm also going to show you the potential that when you combine market hero and Shopify together you're gonna have a lot of functionality you've ever had before ways to upsell your customers way to down sell your customers ways to go and make sure your customers buy what they're originally checking out and hit them up for cart abandonment and basically the sky's limit you're going to see a lot of really cool things here and this is just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do you're actually can go crazy here well let's just start beginning alright first we want to do is go to the app store where there's a link in your dashboard install the app just like any other app that there is now once it's install what we want to do is we want to go over to market here and get our API key and assign a default tag so I'm going to go over here in our settings section and we're going to load that up and your API key is going to be right here in the settings section you can see it right here then you're going to click copy key and you're going to put that in there so this is going to integrate you you're done right there okay okay so once you put in the API tag we want to come down to default tag right here and what this is going to do is tag every person that comes in through our store we want to set this up so we can sort people by store and segment them instead of market hero as you can see right here if I go and type in let's just say my store is source wave okay it's one of my businesses imagine to shop by store I can see everybody that's came to store and as a part of that store this is really useful if per se you have multiple stores ones a snowboard store and you want to separate your customers and talk to them individually you don't want me talking to people to wiener-dog store the same way you're talking to people at the snowboard store so I'm put in wiener-dog guitars right here's a tag and hit save okay you're announced you hit enter and you can also add other tags for example like I don't know tag two and then tag tag three just make sure they line up perfectly with how you put the tags instead of market here so this is all saved boom we're good to go okay perfect now let's get to talking about our product event tags okay these are really simple too so when a person checks out or begins check out for a product we're going to sign a tag team you can see right here I have guitar a check out ok so it's the same way we apply tags just with a default tag except will happen when they're checking out certain proxy say a person is checking out on your product guitar a-ok this will be assigned to them they start and start the checkout process now let's imagine they purchase it suddenly we're going to put a money a tag right here because this is the money tag instead of mark here it shows what people bought for example right here I can see every single person that bought source uni in the system so far ok you can see I had their numbers and dollar amounts right here that's what that's going to allow us to do so that's really cool this is a cool way to track exactly how much people are worth and what they're buying and who's bought what and who's not bought what ok now let's get into the potential right here let's get in the cool part this is where your minds going to start to be blown I create this funnel right here and what this funnel right here does in this instance is it creates a cart abandonment system and an upsell system inside of market here so let's start from the beginning and remember you can drag and drop everything that I'm doing right here right from the start so first thing is going to happen right here it's record what I like to call or what is actually called the start action so whenever the tag guitar 8 checkout is applied it's gonna remove people from all their other funnels and actions that are going on inside market here we can also turn it off if we don't want to but I prefer to turn on so not getting conflicting marketing messages so what's gonna happen right here it's going to wait 15 minutes after that checkout tag has been applied now what's gonna do at this point in time it's going to sort by tag alright the tag is going to be guitar a bots we're going right here and putting guitar a thought remember the money sign because that's what we use for that and it's gonna sort people when they come through now what's gonna happen if they come right here and they haven't bought yet they're not going to have that guitar a bought tag yet so what we need to do is when you send the car abandonments we're gonna send an email right here it's going to send them something saying like hey man you didn't buy the guitar ok then it's going to wait again ok it's going to win another day or so or two days or whatever you want to set it by right here this one's set 24 hours and we're going to grow it here we're going to do sort by tag again if they stolen had the purchased tag we can offer them a special aka down sell on guitar a to just get them over to line and get them to buy something ok now if at any point time they do buy we're going to be sorting by tag remember we're going to sell to it up self we'd be like hey maybe you want to buy a guitar B and we can do the same exact thing right here where we can do the sort by tag again if they haven't bought it yet so another upsell or some another follow-up email do the same exact thing Sam is special and so this right here this simple funnel that I built right here and you can see how easy it is to build the stuff this isn't rocket science I can go right here set the time set the email it's really easy to do this right here shows you just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do inside market here just this right here this is going to increase your sales but like 30 percent because you're hitting up the people that didn't buy originally following up with them saying hey man what's going on while you're not buying you're also segmenting them so you can talk to him easier in the future and we can also upsell them easily you could actually build like a 20-item upsell just based on this alone okay now what this also allows us to do is sort people by what they've bought what they've started checking out what they haven't ok so if we want to go and we want to get everybody from wiener-dog we could do any way I can do everybody from source wave that doesn't have the tags source uni okay so these are the people I need to get buying source uni so for example to your store we could do wiener dog Depot anybody it's part wiener dog Depot that hasn't bought guitar a so we could find everybody on your daughter Depot isn't bought guitar a and try and sell them guitar a okay are when your dog guitars it's a different story sorry I can confuse anybody who hasn't bought a product we can search them out and we have a list of everybody that hasn't bought yet so we can start hanging up saying man you might you need to buy this product you probably bought this too or we could find everybody that has that tag and also has the tags has all the tags right here as all tags source wave source uni and in maybe let's just say another one right here source hunter okay I'm not sure how many people have that in this system right here we can go in and generate that up and what that's going to show us is our hot buyers these are the people that are really really into what's going on in our store so we really we could sell them like a whole different program like a thousand dollar program or something really expensive we only reserved for our best fire so the potential is huge right here and it's so easy to handle because all you needed use of these tags inside of Shopify and instead the streams that basically fire on their own in the sky's the limit okay there's literally unlimited possibilities with this there's so many creative ways you can apply this by using the tags and start action inside of market hero so can't wait to see you inside using this and all that kind of stuff this Ben Becker take it easy
