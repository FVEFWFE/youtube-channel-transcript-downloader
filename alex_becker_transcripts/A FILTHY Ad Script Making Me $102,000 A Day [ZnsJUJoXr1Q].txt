================================================================================

so we going to play my microphone like a banjo for now to start these videos you ever look at your ads and think to yourself why are these things not scaling why are they not converting higher why do I always get to a certain point and I spend more money and then it doesn't convert or maybe it doesn't convert at all you ever wonder why that's happening it's probably because your ads suck no I'm I'm just joking I'm just joking it's a problem with the Internet it's not a problem with your ads but here's why they're not converting okay all right it's because of two simple things you are not getting people's attention in you're not convincing them with enough mph with enough power with enough prowess that clicking on your ad is going to benefit them they don't believe you they're not paying attention to you if you just fix these two things you are going to make so much more money from your ads and I can tell you this because what I'm going to showing this video I use a scale one ad campaign past $100,000 per day just $100,000 cash of about probably about 25 to $30,000 A Day In AD spin I've also used this to grow a SAS business past $100 million valuation so it's worked pretty well for me now of course if if you're making $500,000 a day a billion dollars SAS valuation don't listen to me at all cuz you are a Wise Wise silverback gorilla on hill but if you're below that you should listen you should apply this to your ads because this is going to fix 90% of your ads anytime my ads are not working correctly I just come back and do this this works on YouTube this works on Facebook this works on Tik Tok because it is the basis of human convincing and communication so apply this let me show you so look you can use this literally everywhere Tik Tok Facebook ads YouTube ads it does not matter if you are trying to talk to someone way where the goal is to get them to click something and go somewhere and hear more about it this is how you communicate with them period now look this is a two-part video this video right here I'm going to introduce you to the communication style and the concept you can just use this framework everywhere but you're probably not going to want to think for yourself because who wants to do that okay and so I've made these videos bite chunked because I'm fully aware and empathetic that you have Tik Tok brain you can't focus on one video for more than 10 minute at a time so you can watch this video and then you can come back a year later uh after committing to improving your business and catch the second video this second video that I'm going to link to at the end of this video has an entire breakdown of this script being applied in YouTube ads so you can go and see an ad that I created from it you can see the script walk through it's all on YouTube it's all for free I'm not trying to sell you anything I just want your juicy juicy attention and viewership so I'm just going to give you stuff that's made me tons of money to bribe you for that so look let's get down to this you have about 45 seconds in an ad let me make sure see I'm already off the screen this I really got to work at this this content creation I'm kind of new to it so bear with me look when you're communicating with anybody and you want to get to them to do something on internet you have about 45 seconds but you don't even have 45 seconds you have chunks to get them to the 45 seconds and 45 seconds is the optimum amount of time to get them to then do the thing you want them to do but you need to persuade them enough in this 45 seconds to get them to do do it 45 seconds you try and do it in 5 seconds they don't do it you try and do it in a minute and a half they've already lost attention this is the magic sweet spot and it's broken down into sub sectors so we have the first 10 seconds and we even have the first 5 seconds in that then we have the next 20 seconds and then we have the final 20 seconds with the final 5 Seconds that is the CTA okay so what do we do here the first 5 Seconds of any communication is hooking the person what does this mean it means getting their attention and creating interest in relation to something they want that ties into your business so for example when you watch the beginning of this video what's the first thing I talked about and laid out there immediately that this is going to improve the results of your ads across your business but I also did it in a funny weird way by talking all sorts of hoopla and passive aggressively talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to you you're like whoa what's going on this guy's a dick and he's promising me result what's happening one that's just how I talk in videos but two I'm predispositioned to speak in this this form of communication because I've been doing ads for so long I I no longer function as a normal human being I just completely communicate in copywriting form but we have to go out there and think about what pain or what goal can we trigger in the person it's usually pain that's the best way to roll with it and then how can we put in an attention grabbing way so if you look at any of my ads out there even the low effort ones I'll put like an Iron Man and thumb drive or I'll be wearing a Pikachu onz and what I will then do is make a big bold promise so we want to do something that gets their attention Okay and we might want to make a big bold promise backed up usually with some interesting stat a very detailed and precise stat because the more precise you are the more interesting it is so for example if I just start an ad and said hey do you want to improve your ad results you're like sure but if I'm like hey in a Pikachu onesie wearing a Wizardry hat a Harry Potter hat or let's even make it even weirder let's say I hold a gold fris in front of you and say this is proven across 153 businesses to increase ad results by 15.3% you're like whoa wait what's this goldfish doing and then I have you with this interesting Stat or this big bold promise and so this hooks the person we want to make a big bold promise right here now the next 10 seconds are backing up that promise with undeniable proof and results so what you want to do in your business is you want to get your customers results I know that's a far-fetched thing that people don't really like to do anymore but you should really get them results and then you should get testimonials you should film them in the wild using your product and going like oh wow this is an absolute ass so assuming you can do that one basic step I'm going to assume you can okay if you're watching this video right now and you're like I'm like you got to collect results from your customers you're like but I don't have any of those so what do I do I'm like I I can't help you okay but if you're one of those people that's not running an MLM or pony scheme online you're good so what we need to do is collect results from our customers specifically I'll give you a few techniques that work really well for me is get your product in the hands of influencers and bigger names for free get them to use it and get them to leave testimonials and result and return for whatever just get it done that works really well as well so for example at hyos my ad attribution company um we have an agency that runs Tony Robbins ads you know Playboys ads we have Jay shett on there Patrick B David uses it or for example in like SAS we we get large businesses like clickfunnels or up incoming businesses like runpod businesses that matter to the Target customer okay so for example if I'm trying to Target infom marketers I want to use testimonials from like Grant Cardone or something if I want to Target SAS marketers I want to use testimonials from like clickfunnels or large SAS businesses on our platform and we have all those Tes OS because frankly when people plug their ads in the hos they make 15 20% more guaranteed you should use it but whatever this is that's not for you cuz you don't like making more money the bigger point is get testimonials no matter what and get testimonials from people that are going to be similar to the customer you're trying to acquire now make those testimonials Focus around your big promise so for example if I talk about in an ad how hrus is going to increase people's ad scill I get a bunch of AD scale testimonials and I show those and I back them up and what I'll do a lot of times in videos is make a giant page of testimonials and scroll past them in a really obnoxious way I've been doing this for almost 15 years when I used to launch procs on Warrior Forum uh way back back in the day I would find hundreds and hundreds of testimonials that's just the one thing I would do when I made a product and then I would just paste them all on a page so it took a person like 10 minutes to scroll past all of them it's extremely effective tactic so I back up the big buold promise so what I've done is I've gotten the person's attention and I've triggered some pain or reminded them of some pain or made some big promise of of a benefit or a result and I've backed it up and then what I do is I explain how that is accomplished without explaining it at all so for example what you want to do is you want to make the person watching the ad feel that they are missing out and not doing something and so what you want to explain is you want to explain that thing they're not doing but not in a way they can understand per se so for example at hyos I'll point out how ad platform tracking is just wildly inaccurate and if you're using that you're using the wrong data and if you're using the wrong data you're going to lose a ton of money and then that trains your AI completely wrong on ad platforms thus you make less money and hos fix that by using a new form of print tracking a optimization now what does that mean if we really boil it down did I explain how it does anything no not really that is what it does but that just creates interest and makes you feel like you're not using this and you're just losing tons of money so I got your attention I proved that everything I'm saying works and then I made you feel like you're doing something that is causing you all sorts of pain and not getting you the result you want and you don't understand it so now you feel like you're missed out you're like a person on the outside of a club uh not being let in what a lot of people do at these points in their videos is they try and explain their product and how it works we don't want to do that we want to get the click and so this next 25 seconds we're really going to be focusing on the click and we're going to break this down in two points right here so I just show them all these results and I explain how it works right here now they're thinking how do I do this too okay so what I want you to do is I want you to click this add and we can plug that exact thing into your business without any effort today and get you the same results as all the results I showed you before now what we like to do with hrus is I like to add on to that that hey if it doesn't get you that result you don't pay for it so this makes the person go this guy is insane he must this must actually work or this guy's running the dumbest ad campaign in history you don't have to throw that in I know not everybody can guarantee that but having some form of a crazy guarantee is um usually helpful in ads also in your business if you're if you're are selling a product that doesn't get results and the way you're keeping and making money is keeping people who don't get results as money eventually the business dies so having a crazy refund guarantee is just in your favor yeah you're going to get more refunds at first but you're going to solve and plug the problems in your business and keeping people's money who don't want you to have it makes them mad and then you ruin your business's reputation but who cares about that let's just print money by putting hoopla on Google ads but this is what we want to do in the final SEC 20 seconds okay look if you want to get that result I just talked about if you want to fix this pain click this ad go here do this thing we will get you this result with very little effort just you want to make it as little effort as possible you're going to get this result if you just click this ad we actually guarantee it now this is a really forthcoming ad if you are running for example you're going to see in the next video linked after this me running this like webinars for info products the goal there is to get them to join uh the webinar the free event okay so this in in my hus ads we're going for the call in other ads I'm going to show you we're going for a webinar sale there's other ads I'm going to show you where we're going for like an e-commerce sale so you really want to then the pitch around that and in the final 5 Seconds what you want to do in the ads is give them time to click so reemphasize click hey go here click now this ad will end here in a second go here click now a lot of times I'll just do a black screen with a button on it why because what people do is a lot of people wait till the end of the ad and then it will just end and it will move on to the video and they're like oh I'm not going back to find that ad so that's just a little handy thing you can do right there off the end of it and so this is what you need to do to convince people to do things in an ad it usually takes about 45 seconds if we're going into a minute 30 which sometimes I will do an ads but all the the core message the core thing I'm getting done is always done in this first 45 seconds and then I'll use an extra minute 30 to do extra stuff that you will see in the the videos after this I'll link to Again on YouTube there's no optin or pitch I'm trying to get you into but we need to accomplish this in the first 45 seconds and 90% of our hoopla is going to get done in this first 45 seconds and if you look at my sales videos it's really just this but long longer which is what happens on the page they go to so that's the lesson for the day this right here is what this is how you should make almost every ad it just works there's other things you can do like testimonial mashups and images but if you're making video ads to cold customers this is what really has gotten it done for me in every format for almost a decade you should use it now what should you do you should subscribe to this channel because I'm going to make more videos like this and I know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm talking about unlike everybody else on YouTube and I'm not selling you things this is a great place for you to hang out on top of that after this video I said it's a two-part video you want to see the script you want to see this actually being applied in action right watch the video that's going to show up after this video it's going to be a big black screen it's going to be a video on there with the video you click it it will show you all this in action you can apply it and it will get you better results with your ads so I'll see you the next video
