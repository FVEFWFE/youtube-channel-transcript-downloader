[Music] hashtag urination what is going on this is Alex Becker CEO of this whole market hero thing and today I'm going to show you three simple tactics you can use to increase any Shopify store actually any online business by 30 to 50 percent now before we get going I know this whole shooting setup isn't exactly professional but our studio is not set up yet but I just wanted to kind of drop by and say hi before we hop into my computer over here and get in the content I also want to show you the new market hero phone cases they're pretty cool they increase your signal strength by like 20% - but besides that what is up guys if I'm in my computer right now and let's get into this tactic all right guys we're inside my computer and we're looking at the whiteboard of truth and justice and I'm just gonna get right to it I'm gonna show you the instantly increase your Shopify revenue and this video is gonna be very quick because what I'm gonna show you here isn't complicated then when you apply this to your store it's gonna take you probably about a minute two minutes to actually apply but this is going to overnight increase your sales by thirty to fifty percent so there's four things we can do and I've I've arranged these all out right here on how we can go out there and really kill it so here's the first thing you do and it's it's the easiest of course but this is what most Shopify sellers are doing they're they're running a Facebook ad okay and then we're gonna send this Facebook ad to our store and from the store someone's gonna pay us ten bucks okay so this looks pretty good especially if we're only paying five bucks to get that $10 sales it's a two xry this is fantastic it's actually not because most Shopify sellers are only sending one or two emails a month if that okay we've worked with a lot a lot of stores and about 85% of stores are not sending any emails and in fact there's only about probably 5% stores that are doing their email marketing correctly but this is the first thing you need to remedy this so this person comes through you have their email address you know they would like to stuff and your store they're gonna buy it so what do you do you maybe send them some content and information to make them like your store a little bit more let's imagine they come here and they buy a t-shirt that says hey I like camping we cinema maybe a video on something that teaches them about camping and then maybe the week after that we send them right back to our store to buy maybe a ten dollar flashlight or something like that just simple situation right here has increased our ROI from our ad from just five dollars to fifteen dollars now if we can go again send some more content to them and then send them to another $10 offer and I'm just really dumbing this down of course not all of our offers gonna be ten bucks but what have we done right here we've got to turn us into $25 ROI and so instead of going out there and just getting a 1 X are 100 percent ROI we've gone out there and nearly tripled quadrupled the ROI we're getting so let me show you how to do this inside of your store so I'm gonna do this with our official market hero and alex becker emerge store and show you how i'm actually going to improve sales from my Shopify store doing this so right now we're looking at my store right here we're inside the dashboard and what I've done is I've already connected this store to market here own so what I want to do first off is I want to go and make it so that anybody who checks out for my store automatically has products attached to them so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to turn on automatic sales tagging and so whenever somebody checks out it's gonna sign a tag to them in market hero so I can separate people by what they've bought and what they haven't bought and actually calculate their value to me but more importantly we just want to hit this option first and the next thing I'm going to do is hit import previous customers so what this is gonna do is it's gonna download every single customer in my store that is bought in the past now what I also want to do is I want to import previous products and then I want to import previous orders now more on why I did those other features here in a second but what I can now do is I can go into my app and here's the really cool thing you can see I've actually gone and download every single person that's bought something from my store but I can see exactly who's bought something and more importantly what I can do right now so first things first I want to see exactly what store they came from when I'm doing this so I'm just gonna tag them hero merch so I know exactly where they came from but now what I can do is I can come on over to my broadcast tab and automatically go out there and email every single person's came to my store so let's imagine every week every Monday I just send them a weekly discount or something like that doing that alone will instantly increase my sales 10 to 15 percent overnight just a simple tactic but here's where things start to get really fun so the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna go down and we're gonna do segment and mailing so we want to see who's bought what and sell them what they haven't bought so let's imagine I have two t-shirts at my hero merch store okay so I got t-shirt number one and I got t-shirt number two now obviously what I want to have happen when a person comes to and buys t-shirt number one I don't just want them to just go away forever what I want to do is I want to then sell them t-shirt number two because they're probably interested in buying something else and people that buy t-shirt number two I want to sell them t-shirt number one just doing this let's imagine we have a Facebook ad right here and someone comes and buys a product from us cost us again $10 we profit or $10 we generate in revenue and it costs us $5 to get them there so we just made 5 bucks but an easy way to make another 10 bucks is to then say hey you like this shirt maybe you want to buy this shirt and boom we just made another $10 so how we do that that is so so cool inside of this is we're gonna go over to our lead section and what you can see is I can see exactly what people have bought ok I can see exactly how much they bought of it everything they bought everything like theirs so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and take this tag and I'm gonna bring it on over to our broadcast tab I'm gonna go and select everybody that has this tag you can see boom right there there's that one guy but doesn't have let's just say this t-shirt I'm just gonna select a random one let's just do Hero iPhone ok let's say they haven't bought the iPhone case yet so they just bought the hoodie they have about the iPhone yet so I'm going to remove anybody that has this but hasn't bought this so right there what this is gonna show normally because I haven't sold enough iPhone coverage from my store yet I kind of suck at it but let's imagine right here I have 200 people that have bought this and I have 20 people that have bought this it's gonna remove those 20 and I can send them a message now saying hey you just picked up the hoodie why don't you get the phone case to go with it boom segment and targeted mailing that allows me to segment my customers and sell them what they haven't already bought so that alone right there will again increase our sales by another 10 to 15 percent just doing that because you're getting people that haven't bought something to buy something else now the easiest thing we can do again is if a person comes from our store from a Facebook ad and then they come to our cart and I'm just gonna make a really ugly cart symbol right there that says this is just gonna be our cart they come to our cart and they don't check out they just abandon the cart so they just go somewhere else so what we want to have happen so we then do is we can come back to our Shopify integration market here oh and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set it so that if they come in and don't do this so and set minutes that I want the cart abandonment to work I'm gonna so if they don't check out within 10 minutes of starting check out what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send them a specific email and so I can select a Bandhan cart draft email that I will send them and so when they go and do this an email will be symptom say hey dude you didn't quite check out you know maybe maybe you want to follow up maybe you want to come back and check this out this is the easiest easiest way for us to go and recapture these people and this is just a incident way to increase our sales by an easy 5% easy you just follow up and say hey dude you didn't check out maybe you want to finish your check out now the next thing I want to show you is very cool and then I'm gonna get into something very advanced it allows you to just dominate with advertising but the next coolest thing is up cells and down cells so what we can do right here is inside the app you can have a tag applied whenever a person starts to check out so if the tag hero merch is applied what's gonna happen when they start check out or do anything in my store the second I get their email the tag hero merch is gonna be applied now what we can do is we can go and create a upsell stream so what's gonna happen is I'm gonna create a stream right here and whenever two tag market hero is applied from Shopify what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have it removed from all streams I'm gonna go hero merch they wouldn't want to have happen is I'm gonna have it wait one hour okay I'm gonna have it wait one hour now what it's gonna do after a person checks out is it's gonna follow up with them and upsell them something so let's imagine we know our most popular product is our hoodie so what it's gonna do is it's gonna send out an email now what this email is gonna do is it's gonna send them and I'm not gonna write the hell entire email right here but I just could create a new template right out my email what this email is gonna do is it's gonna sell them our hero hoodie I have to wait 24 hours at least wait one day now what it's gonna do at this point in time is it's gonna wait and see if the person bought the hoodie or not so we're gonna do a sort by tag and if they go through right here and they have bought the hoodie okay if they have bought the hoodie I'm just gonna put in hero hoodie black there we go and what its gonna do is it's gonna see if they bought it or not so let's do this if they do buy the hoodie we're gonna send them to an upsell and we're gonna sell them the iPhone case see how that works now if they don't buy the hoodie what we're gonna do is we're gonna send them a down so we're gonna send maybe a coupon for 20% off of the hoodie now we can endlessly and infinitily do this we could actually just keep doing the down so over and over again if the person still doesn't buy we can have it wait another day and I'm not gonna fill out these ones cuz you kind of get the gist I can have it sort by tag again to see if they bought it now if they do finally buy it then we can send them directly to our upsell boom we can send up to the up so again if not we can send me even better discount like hey we'll give you 50% off but you have to act now then on the discount we can do the same exact thing we can have it wait one day and and if it doesn't go if we don't go and sell that iPhone case what can we then do we can upsell them again so we can sort by tag okay and so if they do have it let's just say if they've bought by now we're just gonna stop selling to them so if they do buy it we're just gonna go to stop if they don't buy we sit in one last email giving them a discount on that iPhone case this right here is humongous when I was skinning my star in internet marketing the easiest way to increase how much money you made from a product launch was just adding an upsell this is adding an upsell and then down sells this completes a trifecta and this right here will easily add another 10% to what's going on in your store now finally what I want to show you is a secret thing I wasn't playing the show in this video but it's called L T V and this is what it means so what I can easily see now that I pulled all my sales data and all my customers in the market here is I can easily see all right I want to see everybody that is coming from my store hero merch all right well we got 25 people now I want to calculate exactly how much they're worth to me on average every single one these people is worth 11 dollars and 59 cents to me but what I'm gonna see over the next few months is I sent email sim these people are gonna keep coming back to my store what's gonna happen is they're gonna keep buying more and more and I'm gonna suddenly see dude when a person comes to my store and begins checkout on average they come back and buy more products and so I'm gonna gradually see this number go up and up and so let me put out a scenario to you let's imagine right now we're on Facebook and we're selling a ten dollar t-shirt in order to make this product even work we need at least at least get someone there for five bucks we need to make we need to spend five dollars to get a ten dollar sale now let's imagine this our competition gets really fierce and the only way we need a ten dollar sale is by spending ten dollars but let's imagine these people then come back and we're able to track everything we're buying we're saying WOW every single person that bought for example let's just do this one right here let's just do this tag for this this t-shirt right here so we have one person let's imagine this person right here it costs if they're LTV for me right now is $56 so I go right here hit generate LTV this person is only one person who's bought something so far so they're worth $56 to me but then let's imagine this person comes back and buys another t-shirt and buys another t-shirt I'm gonna go WOW for every 50 six dollar sale this person on average comes back and spends twenty more dollars on my store so if we apply this right here and we say okay so we just made a $10 t-shirt but I know every person with a ten dollar purchase on average comes back and spends about twenty dollars more with me what does this do our competition has to stop their ads but we don't have to because if we spend ten dollars to make a ten dollar sale we know on average this person is going to come back and spend another 20 bucks with us so what can we do we can outbid our competitors and still stay profitable even when all of our competitors go oh man it's too expensive now to get a sale we can go no it's not every person comes back to the store and over time spends 20 bucks with me in the next two months and in the next six months spends 40 bucks with me and this changes how we do everything because every big brand online usually breaks even on their ads most big brands spend ten dollars to make ten dollars but then what happens is they email their customers afterwards and they keep sending them and they make another ten dollars and then they keep yelling again make another ten dollars they make another ten dollars and they know this and so they know on average for every ten dollar customer they acquire that person on average is gonna spend 40 bucks with them and this changes the entire game and everything I just showed you takes a few clicks to do inside of market here oh that's it that's how easy this can be that's how simple this can be and so that's all I wanted to do for you guys today I wanted to give you this training and show you four methods actually five methods right now that you can use to increase your sales automatically now I'm not gonna do a hard pitch here to you guys I'm not here to do that but what we've done for you guys is I've gone and created a 100% free Shopify course that breaks down how to do each of these methods and way more detail okay and if you click the link somewhere around this video if you click the link it will take you to a page where all you have to do is simply sign up for a free trial

don't care what you do I just want to give you guys some awesome value in this video so this has been Alex Becker CEO of market hero and overall pretty neat guy and I really hope you enjoy this video and this right here I just want to really stress whether sign up for market here or not whether you check it out you need to understand we're working with stores that are doing 500,000 a million a month and applying these tactics adds instantly an extra 20 to 30 percent in revenue that's 200,000 300,000 months we apply this to a store that's making fifty thousand a month it increases it to a $70,000 per month store and you don't have to spend any more money on advertising you don't to do anything else I am begging you whether you hop on this or not apply this to your store and start emailing because the number one way to make more money from your business and the easiest customers to get to spend more are the customers you already have so it's been Becker I'll catch ya on the
