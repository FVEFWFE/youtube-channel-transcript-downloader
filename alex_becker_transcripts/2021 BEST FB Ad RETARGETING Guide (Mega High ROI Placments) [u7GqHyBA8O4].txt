hyrulean you ever sit around and think yourself i wish i knew how to retarget better i wish i had retargeting ads that made a lot more money i wish i knew the proper way to set up a long retargeting campaign to follow people around the internet and convince them to buy my stuff well i think it's pretty obvious that's what we're going to get into in today's video i'm going to show you retargeting campaigns i've set up that miss just made tons of money they work really well and you spend very very very very very little money to actually get these results because the people are already pre-warmed they're already predisposed to buy you just need to know when to hit them and when to hit them and you're going to see some really juicy results that being said we're going to dive into it that's it let's get into it okay guys so when it comes to really crushing retargeting especially in 2021 there's three things you need to look at first off where are you going to be collecting retarding lists from and how are you going to be marketing to them on top of that secondly using your retargeting like a secondary email list instead of using your email list is a strategy you need to know about if you do this you're going to you're going to see huge results with your business especially when it comes to promotions affiliate offers other things you're promoting upsells down cells et cetera most people don't consider this part of the equation right here third you need to understand how you attribute it i know you're probably rolling your eyes saying you know alex ceo of hyrus is going to talk about attribution again if you don't attribute and scale your retarding ads in relation to your cold ads you're going to make a lot of mistakes you're going to hurt your cold ads a whole lot or you're going to waste tons of money on retargeting ads you don't need to be targeting with you need to know the ratios to advertise with and you really can't get those unless you're using proper attribution and you're aware of it most people aren't and they do all sorts of goofy stuff so let's talk about all the places you need to be collecting retargeting first off okay so my biggest thing i'm going to tell you first off is don't over complicate retargeting i see people that have like these deep funnels and people come through it and they all always just it's just not it's just not going to get you the results you're looking for the best thing you need to do is focus on how to make funnels and offers like the train you see on this channel because that's going to get you those three to five xrys and your eye and your ads and i break down the funnels and everything that's worked a lot on this channel just subscribe watch the other videos on this channel and on top of that i release about three thousand dollars in ad courses in our community post tab so if you're subscribed to me you're gonna see those posts about once every two weeks i keep them up for about a day and i take them down that's why you should subscribe because you're not gonna see those posts from me unless you're subscribed to this channel so if you do ads or run a business of any kind that runs ads subscribe or you're a psychopath because i release the best ad content online that being said i see people and they try to put retargeting on all the different pages of their site like a blog post that does this one thing and uh maybe a pricing page on your site and then they run different ads based on the pages the site they view at look is that going to get you slightly better roi's yes but it's not going to be make or break and it's probably going to distract you so much that you're not getting able to comprehend it all in your mind and you're not gonna be able to do move effectively because it's too complex okay so the biggest thing i need to teach you about retargeting is that if you keep it simple you're probably gonna get better results okay so the way to keep it simple is to collect retargeting from two places and then treat these two places differently or two categories so your first level retargeting is just going to be anybody that visits your website not your ad landing pages or funnels your website okay so if someone comes to highrest.com and clicks anywhere on this website that's where we're going to be getting all juicy with okay all right so keep that in mind now emails anybody that puts in their email on your website just needs to be on your retargeting list period okay and then finally youtube and any of your content youtube is able to generate great retargeting lists so for example when i send training to my customers when i put this training online the youtube retarding lists are spot on because there isn't all the blocks and everything that you're seeing other places youtube and google are very aware of who's watching a youtube video that has no problem tracking those and just marketing to that user or customer whereas if it's on the website youtube and google have to line up what it's on the website with who's using their platform they have access to directly who's watching on youtube okay so the way you're going to market to these customers right here in particular is slightly different in how you're going to market the people that click ads okay and we can actually move youtube down here but i'll talk about how to do it in different situations so if these type of ads right here we're not going to send people to the top of our funnel we're just going to send people to go for the kill okay because if people have entered their email they've already in our funnel people on our website reading around around they've already entered our funnel okay so we want to send them back just the point where they need to buy it so for example when i'm using this on hi-ros i'm going to send people on our retargeting ads just right back here okay just write to the main landing page not to a funnel not to anything else because i don't really need them to do other steps i already have access to their information i don't need to collect information on them and i'm going to be using my retargeting ads like a second email list so again i don't really need to be collecting their email and going through the whole deep funnel i want to get them to book a call so a lot of times with these type of pages sending people back to the main sales page sending people right back to the actual page where something or the objective is being done it's going to work a lot better it's a lot simpler and we don't need to be sending them down our funnels again okay just keep sending them to the goal point that's at least what works for us very well okay now we're going to do that for people that visit our website our email list and youtube in general just send them straight to the offer this works great for us okay now what also you need to consider is people that click your ads aka the people that land on the top of your funnel or click an ad or people that have recently watched your youtube you need to you need to split test and see which one works better for this right here so for example if you're watching this video right now you're just going to get ads literally just sending you straight to our call booking page you should book a call at hiros we literally guarantee you'll get better ad results in your ad so you don't pay for it okay that's why like literally every big influencer on planet earth is using us right now anywho not to brag about harass but when you're sending people and retargeting people in your funnels what i suggest doing is anybody clicks the ad just send them right back to the original opt-in page or landing page for your ads don't go crazy and like hit them up with a completely different ad and a completely different offer just use the same ads to them over and over again this works great okay again you could make special ads for people who've already clicked your like how you come back do this thing whatever a lot of times if people haven't interacted with your funnel or gone down the funnel they don't remember enough for that really to be effective so hit them with their most effective ad over and over and over again so they finally do what you want as soon as they enter your funnel move them into this just basically sending them the offer over and over again this works great and it's easy now the reason why you want to use these big giant audiences right here instead of using microns is again ios 1 14 has and i always name it the wrong thing it's either 1.4 or 14 i'm an idiot by the way you shouldn't ever watch anything i say anyways micro items just don't do very well and you just can't get the amount of traction you need with them because the targeting is just so small okay so it usually happens when you use micro audiences that you just can't get the the the reach that you need okay and you're just gonna be marketing the same like two people over and over again it's it's keep it to the bigger audiences and now the other thing i want to talk to you about that's really important is email lists don't work quite like they used to okay so for example people used to live and die by their email list and you understand people don't really check their email that much anymore they have like 16 different email addresses and they don't they don't it's just not how they get their information anymore and it's not an effective way to communicate with your customers not that email is bad i'm saying you need to start viewing retarding ads as your second email list or actually your main email list why is look if i get someone's email i can only message them about once per week with a marketing message before they stop opening if your email open rates go down you you you your delivery just gets tanked google just says no you're not you're not you're not hitting the inbox anymore that's just how it's going to work okay so what you need to do instead is look at these different layers of retargeting as your different email list so for example if i have a new offer or an upsell or something i want to promote to my customers what i want to do is use these lists that i have right here specifically existing customer lists which are going to be these ones right here people actively investigating our product without needing an ad and so i can go and follow these people around on the google display network on youtube on all the facebook platforms do this right here with a simple image ad even it's pretty much impossible for kirsten your customer to get on the internet without being hit by you okay so whenever i'm making a new promotion anything like that i'm just going to load up a gdn ad a youtube ad a facebook ad usually just image based and hit all my customers with that maybe for two to three days look ads don't have to be a long term thing you can run an ad for two to three days when it's roi is exceptionally high and then turn it off okay ads don't have to be long term you can use them as promotional things because you're only hitting your most active of active customers so that's how i would use retargeting right now there's a few things you need to be very very careful of when you're doing retargeting the first and foremost thing you need to be super aware of in facebook ads i'm going to tell you about when it comes to attribution and setting up your campaigns we go and look at this campaign right here i've set this on before this video so you can see what it looks like on default but you're going to see detailed targeting expansion is on this is facebook's way of breaking out and just going and marketing to everybody and blowing up your ad spend turn it off okay turn it off you don't need this on here you don't need detailed targeting expansion because it's gonna break outside your list okay it's going to break outside your list of people you can target it's just going to be a big old mess make sure to turn that off that's absolutely huge now on google ads make sure when you're creating a new campaign for your retargeting make sure to just set it to website traffic so you're gonna get as many clicks as possible because you're just you're not targeting things that need to have optimization to the pixel that the list is too small when it comes to retargeting to need an ai to optimize for you're already messaging and running ads to your targeted customer you don't need the ai for this so just set the website traffic and just you want to get as many clicks as possible that's it that's all you want to get all right now remember display and video and discovery are all different things you can remark it with okay so video ads are going to be ads that really go and interrupt people's youtube videos display is going to follow people around the internet display works a lot better as an email list alternative because you can just have your little face popping up on every website the person's on it's almost like having a notification okay discovery you can put stuff in gmail you can run the little you can run special promotions from that usually not going to get you the best bang for your buck it can work you should try it and you have video so usually when i'm going to do like a remarketing campaign a short promotion one i'm going to use both of these every single time if i'm going to do a promotional campaign i might use discovery in some cases but i'm too lazy most the time so i just use this now you also need to understand finally when you're using display or video or remarketing what happens is you burn through the customers very quickly this means that you really don't need this means that you don't really don't need to be spending that much on your ads for about 340 bucks i got a thousand views on it and that's a large amount of my retargeting list okay so that's a large amount of people coming in here and so you need to understand if you crank this up to like 100 150 200 bucks a day we're just going to be messaging people way too much and wasting ad spend you want remarketing campaigns not to be polite by any means but you don't need to be hitting people three times a day with your remarketing ads one ad per day is about what you're going to be looking for so when you're looking at the frequency in your ads and you're saying the views and everything try to hit a person at .5 times a day so every other day try to look for that type of frequency when you're running your ads if not it's just going to burn and hit the person over and over again and it's just unnecessary and so what people do a lot of times that's finally going to mess you up is they're they're going to see a retarding campaign pop off and they're going to increase the ad spend when really what happens a lot of time is the initial ad was clicked and then someone sees the retarding campaign and so what really needs to be increased is this ad you don't need to be increasing the spend on a retarding campaign the best way to actually do that and see that is using something like scientific mode and hirose okay so here's a perfect example of this this going haywire so when people search the hi-ros keyword obviously they've already seen an ad or something in the future so if i'm looking at this this mode right here in hi-ros traffic and of course i can dive into our dashboards and see the tracking way deeper so here's a perfect situation on this right here so here's our search campaigns you can see our search campaigns right here last click are not doing so well okay they're not they're not doing as well as the scientific mode what scientific mode is is basically this let's say we got a 15 day span right here and we have a sale that happens within the 15 days or outside the 15 days so let's say this is the first click right here let's say the sale occurs on a last click okay so if the sale occurs within 15 days of the first click or any time span i set it's going to go to this first click sale i want to attribute it there because that's the campaign and needs to be scaled we could even lower it down to like three days or five days or something like that this is the campaign that's during the sales now if a retargeting ad or an ad generates a sale outside of the 15 days so it's been 15 days since the first click we obviously don't want to attribute this to the first click we want to give it to the last click okay so if we're targeting ad campaigns and other sources what continually happens is you can see the same thing is happening right here in our search campaigns the search campaign is actually starting a lot of the sales but it's not finishing a lot of them okay you need to be able to see that across facebook your youtube ads your email marketing and whatnot if you don't see this what could happen right here is i can only see in last click mode when i'm using my accurate tracking i could i could think it's not doing that well and i could turn this off okay but if i turn this off i'm gonna be hurting my retarding campaigns this thing helps retargeting it helps our secondary traffic sources it helps other ads on other platforms immensely thus i can crank this one up to keep seeing results okay so it's incredibly important you do that with your ads and even when you have multiple traffic sources are you going to be turning off things based on the last click that isn't accurate okay so that's the last thing i can tell you you should pick up hi-ros i don't understand why you'd run ads without it i don't care what you do if if you run i don't care if you even hire a guy with a wiffle bat to chase people down and hit them after they buy something asking where they came from you need to know this information or you're going to be scaling up the wrong things okay so for example in this situation i would scale this campaign down and then increase my retarding campaigns or my other campaigns and other traffic sources that aren't generating the initial click or sale and then those would have been failed campaigns and i would have been turning off the campaigns making the most money you do that you're gonna make less money don't make less money so that's the lesson for the day guys that's how everything that i see happening as far as retargeting ads go again subscribe to this channel i release new videos every single week and i post links to free courses that you can get there you can go buy them for 3 000 or somewhere else or you
