hashtag cure nation what is going on this is alex becker and you are on your third open email from us you open two more and you get that six hundred dollar course free now what you're gonna see in today's video is a live storm i did that basically breaks down here let me show you how I've grown my channel from zero to over three hundred and close to three hundred twenty thousand subscribers as I make this video and more importantly check out some of these stats in this videos you can see this video right here a hundred sixty two thousand views 158,000 186 two hundred ten eighty to two hundred seventy seven and it just goes on and on and on so what I'm gonna show you in this video is exactly how I go and get hundreds of thousands of views on videos and no it's not because it subs subs don't actually matter on YouTube and most importantly let's tie this back in the business it's not just about getting famous on YouTube and putting a cool youtuber it's about going out there and actually making money in doing this you can see right here I generate about eight thousand dollars a month just posting on YouTube but more importantly the viewers that come on here I will routinely generate about five thousand to ten thousand dollars a day just retargeting and with super cheap ads and I want to show you the ROI on these things so I'm inside my ours dashboard what you can do what's so cool about YouTube is every person that views your video becomes a retargeted person on a list for you this means you can target someone who knows you who probably likes you because they just watch your video and is interested in what you're selling because they just watched your video on the topic so this is a really specific audience I have right here of people that watch my marketing videos not so much my Star Wars videos and you can see right here I spent about fifty five thousand dollars and about three hundred twenty eight thousand dollars back now the thing here about AdWords is the DES tracking is probably way up so we'd probably be closer about five hundred thousand dollars from the fifty five thousand dollars and actually if you go and look at the last 30 days right here the last thirty days you spent about five thousand dollars did probably $50,000 in sales back the advertising and this is not like other advertising where you're going and marketing the people that are cold then what we're doing is remarketing people that are already predisposed to buy therefore they're gonna watch more so it probably only takes one cent again to watch the view that's how much it will cost and Adwords and we're gonna be making like a 10 X or Y without too much effort just like you're seeing here and that's what you're gonna see today the one thing I want to

videos on YouTube on top of the eight thousand dollars a month in Adsense on top of all the branding and exposure that we're getting on YouTube if you are doing a business and you are not on YouTube I think you're insane and this stream is gonna make it very clear why let's get this going guys alright so welcome to live stream I got all set up right let me load up my little doodle pad right here and what are we gonna be talking about tonight guys what are we gonna be talking about tonight's nothing but the legendary YouTube by the way if you're my Instagram we get the vote on what I talk about each day on these live streams and so you should definitely be there so what I'm gonna be breaking down today guys it's a little strategy you guys asked me to do again which is all about YouTube and look a lot of people are kind of reluctant than getting the YouTube let me just kind of show you like some daily stats right here let me just go blood up the screen drop this down move this aside look how good we're getting into the stream and stuff right here but guys look I'm gonna show you a simple little strategy right here and this comes from a whole bunch of other ads right here but here's about what we've done today did about 28 that let me actually refresh then stripe for you guys then about 28,000 actually got thirty thousand dollars in sales about ten thousand dollars in sales and PayPal today and here's our ad spend about eleven thousand dollars on YouTube and so if you want to see how we're doing that you should probably listen up because what I'm gonna show you today is we're about ten thousand dollars of that income comes from it's actually using free traffic and using a very simple retargeting method I'm going to show you to turn that free traffic into customers now look you can also go and use the traffic I'm about to show you you can get sales for free but if you're smart you're gonna do the retargeting okay so this is gonna be a pretty spiffed assed extreme so give me a three if you're excited because we get this going by the way guys we are giving away a copy of H com 2020 live on the stream and the way I'm gonna pick out the person who gets it is it's a person who's most active in the comments so if I see you commenting a lot I see being a cool cat I see you give me way too much attention because I'm very insecure I need it there you get H come 2020 so that's like a two thousand dollar course so guys look I'm just gonna dive straight into the topic of the evening let's make sure I get everything loaded up right let me expand this a little bit so you can see very clearly come on down come on down there we go well pal okay that really didn't change anything at all but it made a big difference like I just tell me it did so look guys let's get into the topic at hand all right so my notes right here great so what I want to talk about first up guys is why you want to be doing YouTube right now because you're probably thinking you know why on earth would I want to make a YouTube channel and it's very very important okay because I want you to understand exactly what happens when people come to your YouTube channel so let's imagine go on put a bit Oh up on thank you thank you over all the people saying hey I see it we got like a ton of people pouring on right now and like a few live stairs ago I tried to answer questions and it just gets crazy because I never Annie back and forth for trolls and stuff like that so if you put a video up on YouTube what YouTube is gonna do if you use the algorithm the way I'm gonna show you in this livestream today and by the way if you hop off you don't get to see the rest of the livestream so don't hop off because I got something actually crazy free thin okay I'm gonna give you like a zillion dollars worth of stuff so look when you upload a video if you use the algorithm the way I'm gonna show you what it allows you to do is get thousands of people let's say ten thousand people to the video now this is gonna happen every single video but if you use the algorithm the way I'm gonna show you this this video you can consistently if you're just starting off get two thousand to five thousand views and by the way it has nothing to do subscribers whatsoever so let's imagine we're in the camping niche right here and we're able to send this amount of traffic to our video by the way there is no other platform on earth there is no other website on earth that's gonna give you ten thousand free visitors maybe Instagram if you get like a really nice post up there but there's no platform on earth that is gonna send you ten thousand visitors warm them up to your offers and get them to like you and become customers for free there just isn't period look at Logan Paul look at Jake Paul there is no platform on earth that is gonna send you that amount of business for free okay maybe vine back in a day Instagram to a little extent but look this is where you want to build it but I want you to understand one thing if you get a thousand people to a video what just happened is you did something very important okay so a lot of you guys probably come to your website again everybody pouring and give me a quick one if you can hear me someone said okay okay I'm listening I like it somewhat everybody saying such mean things about Logan Paul be nice to Logan Paul guys he's he's apologized he's apologized for his mishaps okay so let me make sure that many chat went out all right so look I'm gonna tell you why when you probably send people to your website they don't turn in the customers okay it's probably because you suck at your website first off your app site probably doesn't look great and you probably aren't selling too well but the very bare minimum I want you to really think about a time you went to a website and bought something where you didn't know anything about the business or who it was okay now I want you to think about a time now where you saw a video of somebody your you've got to know somebody a little bit do their videos you got to know their brand or you got to know the brand overall and then you went to their website and it was really really ugly but because you really like the person's videos and that even though the sales process isn't good but you like the person's videos you bought why does this happen why can't a site if it looks really good and you got sent to it but you don't know what it's about why would you not convert there when you're converting at an ugly website with really bad Sun it's because of this rapport trust and respect now look if you have rapport with somebody it means you like them okay you like the person you like what they're doing trust you believe what they're saying okay and respect you believe they are the best at what they're doing all right there you believe they're very knowledgeable if you have all three of these things it is infinitely easier to get someone to buy something okay and don't worry we're gonna get to the algorithm how to get all the free traffic how to get the sales even exactly how we're doing this we're spending like 11,000 making like 40,000 we just made like another thousand bucks right now we're on the stream about another 10k in PayPal right now if you want to know what to do that don't worry we're gonna get that but look if you have these things it's gonna be extremely easy to sell even if your sales skills are awful okay and you want to look you want to pay attention this right now if your sales skills are awful because look if you're watching this right now you probably not you probably good internet marketing you're probably beginner most of you are maybe 10 percent of people here have a business it's working that's fine that's fine but if you have these things right here it's gonna be so much easier to close sales you guys might have seen sales pages I put up online the reason why those sales pages work even though they're really boring okay there's a few like the hero sales academy sales page has like nothing on it we have like 2,000 members in there right now it's also because the contents amazing but people don't know that but they come from the YouTube channel they check and I go wow that's awesome so what just happened what YouTube is gonna do for us is when we put a video up online and then it sends traffic to us for free what YouTube is gonna do is it's two things first off it's going to give us a little way to run ads to every single person that viewed that video no more on that later on but more importantly what it's going to do is it's going to send people to that video and what are we gonna build rapport trust and respect respect okay get it it's all about the respect all right I'm gonna make a lot of Logan Paul jokes tonight so look once you have those things if you can get this person to go to your website then you're gonna be in a very good position now here's the problem though on your videos if you link to your website you're gonna see your videos not get as much traction as they could be now you can still sell from your videos once you warm up the algorithm a little bit to your channel okay I'm gonna talk about how to do that here but more importantly guys what you need to understand is we really don't want to sell in our videos we want to use our videos to get tens of thousands of views and I'm going to show you how to do that and so what I want to break down to you is my exact strategy okay I'm gonna show you my xx tragedy it easily generates 10k a day it's it's very very very simple and you're gonna understand it right away but give me a one if all that makes sense real quick okay someone said one more Logan Paul reference people don't like the Logan Paul references guys guys come on guys it's it's it's I forgot what's what's his sayings I don't know that my Logan Paul sayings anymore what are they no gangster alright I don't I don't know I haven't watched enough I used to watch his channel a lot for giggles but I don't do anymore all right so you guys are clearly getting it good good all right so the next thing we want to get into is look how does a strategy work it's very simple so if you go to my channel you're gonna see that I'm gonna actually lower it where's my channel let me go to my actual channel you know that thing I can see myself streaming to myself right now is it am I in the future because that's what's going on if you guys saw my can you die video you know that I'm technically in a different time warp than you but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do that alright so look if you look my channel right now I want to point one thing out I have 256 thousand subscribers but I'm gonna show you something if you look at my videos right here it's really hit and miss so if I make a Star Wars video 143 thousand views I make a video games video 5k views I make a video on building a business about 13 K views it's pretty obvious right now that subs don't really matter okay I can show you a lot of Shopify bloggers I can show you a lot of people that have way less substance I do to get more views than I do and that's because what YouTube looks at is not your sub count sadly I would love if it just sent it my video to all my subscribers that's not how it works okay what YouTube is gonna do is gonna look at the metrics behind your video and if you get the right metrics on your video what is then going to happen is YouTube is gonna blow that video up so doesn't matter if you have subs or not and so I noticed this a while back and so what I will do is I make videos using a very specific strategy and I use a headline a combination of the headline the thumbnail and going for a high watch time to get YouTube to blow up my video for example this video right here the Star Wars video got 143 thousand views in about a week okay that right there is worth probably like fifty to eighty thousand dollars for me I'm gonna explain why in a second okay but just understand that it's about 50 to 80 thousand bucks to me and I'm gonna show you exactly how I do that so what you're gonna notice is if you get a video that has a high watch time gets a lot of clicks and has a good thumbnail YouTube is gonna blow it up so what I do is I make these videos and I'm gonna get YouTube to send me anywhere from 10k to 100k views on average now if I make an entertainment based video I'm usually gonna get that hundred K views and so what YouTube then does is it gives me a retargeting list of let's imagine this alright so I make a shop of a video it gives me the 10,000 people who just watched that video okay and so I can go right here into my shared library and AdWords I can go to audiences and I can literally find every single person that's viewed that video and I'm gonna show you how to get these views here in a second if you're feeling a little bit overwhelmed just bear with me so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create an audience of anybody that viewed a video from my channel okay so this is I literally have an audience inside my account I'm not gonna scroll down to it right now but it has like I think like 8 million people on it or something like that but more importantly iWitness I wanted to go and target people that have watched in the past two days so these are people that just watch my videos these are gonna be the people most likely to convert so what I'm gonna do is it's gonna give me a retarding list of 10k to 100k people and so right after they watch that video what's gonna happen is I'm gonna send and add to them on AdWords say hey I noticed you just watched this video or if the person just watched a video on Shopify what I'm gonna do is I'm going to send them to our HTM 20/20 webinar okay so let's imagine this I get 10,000 people to watch my Shopify video and if I can get those 10,000 people and then I can get I don't know 500 of those 10,000 people who just watched my video they opted in for a webinar I converted about 3% on that webinar okay so 250 show up that's about 7 sales ok that's about 7 sales about 14,000 dollars in my pocket now what's going on right here if I get like a hundred K Beus or something like that I can do the same exact thing I said hey this is Becker I saw you just watched my videos come and tend to live event today we're building a business if I get 100k views man I just get 30 people to watch that that's 60,000 bucks does that make sense but why do those people opt-in why are they so much cheaper you need to understand that when I run an ad to these people usually right here I'll show you um I'll show you this alright so check this out here's a perfect example of me doing this right here so I'm gonna do last let's see last week okay so it costs me usually about seven eight dollars to get people to sign up for a webinar now these are people that IRA targeted from video views and my subscribers and stuff like that and if you actually go back I was paying about $1 per opt-in for our webinar all right a dollar per opt-in okay and the amount we were generating per day is about 8,000 bucks a day at $1 per opting we're spending probably about 500 bucks to make 8,000 back that's what you understand because these people they've just watched the video they just watched you and you just gained rapport trust and respect then you ask them to attend a webinar when they on this kind of rapport trust and respect hi and what's gonna happen is boom they buy and they convert much higher and they opt-in much higher so give me a one if that makes sense so far if you having some aha moments yes RTR go to the RTR dance alright anyone remember the Macarena I was watching this video the other day like that brought the Macarena and I remember when I was like in fourth grade doing that that's that's how you know you're cool alright first person I want to see I want to see Macarena chants in the chat right now this gives this really increases your odds of getting H come 2020 alright first person to say hey Macarena gets twenty cool points in my book alright alright we're done we're done there we go there we go thank you guys all right that gives you 20 cool points if you put it in there I'll remember you at the end of this and we're giving out those things so guys how do we get these views all right how do we get these views pretty simple okay so what I'm gonna do is let me make sure I'm on pace with my notes is I want to go and let's imagine we're in the camping niche and I use the camping niche because it's so easy to sort of explain what all right so let's go to YouTube and let's type in make sure I'm screwing the same thing alright cool so let's go and type in survival and let's go find some channels okay so um primitive technology right here so there's three tactics you can use to consistently get views and I just use the if you watch my videos the ones that actually go and try and get views for I use one of these three topics or strategies every single time so I'm gonna show you the first strategy right here so I'm gonna go back to my channel I don't know why I came over here we're live everything's just gonna be awful if you want better teaching this is why you watch the videos if you want a complete mess of a thing you come to the live streams alright so let's go and look at this video right here alright so read the headline right here how to make a thousand dollars a day at fifteen years old or as a beginner alright eight hundred eighty one thousand views now we're gonna go to my buddy deadbeat Dan's deadbeat super affiliate alright and I love Dan by the way I'm not giving him poop or anything right there so look look at his most viewed video how to make $100 a day as a lazy 16 to 17 year old do you see the similarity in headlines and you see the similarity and thumbnails yes so what you want to do if you want to have a successful YouTube channel go and look at other channels and I'm telling you this copy their headlines and thumbnails and put a slight twist on them like Dan did right here by the way I copied an headline headlines too I copied an the syllables head we all copy each other's headlines okay no one none of us are original we're marketers all right if we were original we'd be you know going to Japan and filming stuff in the woods and and yelling on trampolines like Logan so look we're gonna go back to my channel man I want to actually let's go that survival Channel survival Channel there we go so we go over here to primitive technology and I mean these guys look like they haven't made I mean if who doesn't want to go live in a hut in the woods and sleep and a pile their own you know have you ever seen that show naked and afraid good gosh that this place I'm like the the what you might call it the National Geographic Channel or whatever this is one chant it plays it 24/7 straight I don't understand how that show caught wind but it's weird don't go google it so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go look at this guy's channel let's go look at his videos and let's organize them by popularity all right bingo bingo there we go so primitive technology bow and arrow alright so we could obviously make a video on how to build a bow and arrow in the woods something like that how to build your forge in the woods how to make mud bricks alright primitive technology how to make mud bricks or something like this like these people really effing like making mud bricks I don't see the appeal but 22 million people than six months so look let's imagine we are selling something that I didn't cover what we're gonna sell let me back up and do that so let's imagine we have an e-commerce store okay and we have are we up to we could have do this two ways we have a survival course or we have an e-commerce store the ecommerce store sells tents and our site sells a survival course okay easy enough so those are what you're gonna sell and you can get the tents by going to aliexpress.com and we're gonna do tents so what are you gonna do if you don't know what drop shipping is we're basically gonna go then find a tent on here alright so you see this one right here Kim can pop up down out there camping tip quick and automatic opening tent for whatever all right so it's 40 bucks we could easily sell this tent for $150 from our website then what we do is we come to this website we buy the tent and we ship is the person that bought that's called drop shipping and it's done in every story you've ever been in whole food 7/11 the dollar store maybe I don't know yeah pretty much every store ever so knowing that now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go and say all right so how can we get people to our tent or a survival store we're gonna go and make videos just like this teaching people how to survive in the woods maybe using the tent that we're gonna sell in our store or we're gonna teach people how to survive in the woods and then afterwards tell them hey look by the way if you like this video come check out my course and the way we're gonna do that we'll make videos like this channel is made okay and copy the videos and we want to do about three to four videos a week is that a lot of videos not really actually it at my usual pace no not at all but look if you can rack up a subscriber list of or not even a subscriber list a view list of 10 20 50 thousand people that is enough to make six figures a year easy I'll show you how here in a second now the next way you can go and get a lot of views is you want to go and copy trends so check what I'm doing on my channel alright so we're gonna go to my channel pop on over so I want to show you some of my most popular videos we're gonna go order them by most popular so look you're gonna notice how I blogged about Star Wars a lot why well first off the last Jedi did you see that it's offensive it's offensive okay I'll just leave it at that Luke Skywalker has no business doing the things he was doing with that fat little bubble creature down by the creek alright that was inappropriate and I felt like I was watching an adult film Luke Skywalker is one of the actors that was not cool alright but anyways a lot of people were also very pissed off they shared my same feelings about this and so I noticed there's a lot of trending anger about the movie and so I made a bunch of videos on it look at this video 275 thousand views 400,000 views do you keep going down there's another one right here 143 thousand views look what do you want to do is you want to look out for trends so what were some really good videos you could have made a video about this last week to get a lot of views the Zuckerberg thing I believe the Han Solo trailer came out and what you want to do is you want to look for relevant news big news to Syria thing with Trump okay you want to make videos about them and then tie that into your topic why it's gonna bring a lot of viewers to your channel now this isn't the best way to get organic viewers that are really interested in your topic but this will bring a lot of people in now the final way to get a lot of views is what I like to call feats of strength and this is where you go and do something ridiculous and really this isn't the best way to get views it's a really good way to grow your channel but I would really start off with the headline thumbnail tactic I talked about but check this one out here rich kid buys over a thousand overwatch loop boxes so I went and bought 1,000 overwatch loot boxes I think it cost me like nine hundred dollars to do that I made my money back in the Adsense alone from this video so I think I think if you get a million views on a video it's probably about a thousand to two thousand bucks you're gonna make so that's about the give or take it depends on your channels value and stuff like that but what you do is you go and do something crazy not super crazy but there's all sorts of things you can do for example I get go I can go get in the Ferrari and go pick people up in uber okay that would be a really viral video you can make videos comparing certain things like here's one $100 steak versus thousand dollar steak okay check out this one 27 million views so what you want to do is you want to create videos that trigger a question okay so you could do $10 survival tent versus $1,000 survival tent you could do let's just do like a survival video right here alright so you could have watch me survive in the woods for one week I'm not saying that would be the best idea right there but look how many views this thing got 1.5 million views you make one of those videos and I would do maybe one of these videos once a month you're gonna get lots of views you can turn those views easily easily into customers so those are the three ways to get views okay give me an X if you're tracking right now give me those x's and remember the people that are most that are coming the most interacting the most you're up to win age comm 2020 okay let me make sure awesome look at all those X's I like it I like the participation we're gonna do the X dance now donate some money to I think you can do that in YouTube domine donate me ago the first person to find a way to donate a dollar on this channel I'm gonna give you H comm 2020 to donate a dollar alright and if we get $10 and donated i will donate them to save a puppy or something I don't I don't I don't know okay I like all those X's guys I'm enjoying this alright so look now how do we get people to view our video very simple so the next thing you want to do is you want to go through you need to understand there's two things that control whether people or whether your video explodes all right it's it's clicks you're right and watch time now there's tons more stuff that goes into videos being viewed but if you can consistently nail these two you're gonna be okay so CTR is handled by those tactics I just talked about alright it's handled by those now watch time how do you get a high watch time it's very simple one you're not gonna always get a good watch time but you need to make your watch time go about eight minutes if you can get about eight minutes of watch time on average on your video you're going to do pretty well so what you want to do is you want to upload videos are about 15 to 18 minutes in length alright if you go look at my most popular videos the the Star Wars ones for example they're about 20 minutes of rant now when you're making these videos what you need to do in the first minute is you need to hook people the most important thing is you hook people what a lot of people do is they say hey subscribe to my channel by the way I make videos on this and man I really love mac and cheese I'm gonna go get some mac and cheese real quick be right back just remembered I'm in my garage I don't have any mac and cheese guys but look guys here's what the video is about today it's about this book it's really good see that's what most people do in their videos that's when people click away and that's why you see so many people if their YouTube channels and they get like 50 views per video it's because they do stuff like that hook people in the first minute so if I'm making a video about how to make 10,000 a month on shop I'm gonna say look in this video I'm going to start it off with a crazy intro and the first 30 seconds make people go what's going on here then the next 30 seconds what I'm gonna do is say hey look in this video you're gonna see step by step how to make $200 a day on Shopify without without any investment and you're gonna see able to do it in 32 seconds whatever creates curiosity and then get into your topic and don't stop progressing spend about 30 seconds per point and then keep moving keep moving keep moving keep moving especially if you're doing educational videos especially if you're doing educational videos if you're doing entertainment base videos show some emotion get a little bit angry rant a little bit people like angry rants they just do that's just that's just a side talk but what you want to do is just make sure to make your videos and progress very rapidly you don't need high levels of quality you don't need this a two thousand dollar camera take out your iPhone turn it sideways get a white light shoot some videos okay there are tons of videos online where people have made tons of views just from an iPhone okay so give me a three real quick if you're still tracking you're getting this it's all making sense that's how you go and get that's how you use the algorithm and look guys one thing you understand as a lot be you might be tempted to go back to you like your SEO roots cuz i got into SEO and back when i first go to youtube you could use PP ends and all sorts of stuff the rink don't do that anymore you just want to go for watch time and click-through rate and while there might be some SEO tricks still out there look my SEO trick makes videos about star wars make videos buying loot boxes and video games get a ton of views alright shooting threes like the NBA yeah I like that there we go awesome alright so how do we make money now how do we make money so this is very simple so we're gonna make these videos we're gonna upload them and I would really encourage you to do three videos a week three videos a week is what you need to do why because I just increases your odds it's kind of like playing a slot machine not every video is gonna work I mean like look at some of the videos on my channel I have some real stinkers okay I have some real stinkers like this one right here like check out this one right here like I made a video game video none of you guys watch this video game video not nice not a nice thing to do guys okay so knowing that you want to upload many videos as you can and you want to kind of play around with your topics like obviously I can get a lot of views if I use a celebrity name or I go in there and I use like a big trend or something like that so now that we're doing that guys we want to go and create an ad so how do we create an ad very simple you want your ad to be about a minute in 30 seconds the first five seconds you need hook them and how do you do that you pitch them on what they're gonna get without all the things they hate hey do you want to make $4,000 a month without investing or working hard hey do you want to go camping in the woods but keep getting attacked by bears hey do you want do you want to be more attractive to girls but you don't want to lose weight here's my magic secret dude or dudette all right so that's what you do okay what I would do honestly you should just make a video where it starts off and it says you're fat and then and then just yell that and then obviously everybody will pay attention and be like and you should be like you're fat if you were 20 or more pounds overweight by the way you don't have to do that here's our special sitting yeah don't don't do that but that would be kind of funny you might see that ad in the future if I can get that approved all right so look after the first five seconds where you hook them we want to spend about 30 seconds explaining how they're gonna get all those things so hey do you want to go camp in the woods but you keep getting attacked by bears well you know that this special tent that we showed in one of our videos it's been displayed on our channel Survival super dudes calm it's been displayed on our channel and what's happened is when we put in this tent bear attacks have reduced by 90% and we didn't have to do a thing we can sit in there and eat our SpaghettiOs and no bears are doing anything to us it's it's a maze it's amazing and so what we're doing today is we're actually giving a huge discount on this tent because you've viewed our channel and so if you click right here we're gonna give you 50% off and so what you want to do on this part of the video for about 10 seconds is give them a call to action saying look we're giving this tent 50 percent off on our store today we're giving 50% off our survival course you need to come here right now and if you don't come here right now the Bears are gonna get your SpaghettiOs nobody likes sharing their SpaghettiOs alright so what you didn't need to do is another three seconds is you need to explain the benefits say like look this tent is insulated if a bear touches it they catch on fire instantly they don't tell PETA but yeah it's amazing tent and then you need to close in the next ten seconds telling them hey the tents here hey the tents here that's it you do that you're gonna be doing really well and you I want you to understand most ecommerce experts they run an ad the people that don't know about them in their brand therefore the ad doesn't work if you run your ad to a person that respects you have rapport with and trust you RTR all right even though I set out to order okay if you were if you're running out to a person who has RTR especially coming up the high of watching your video you're gonna see I'm not joking five hundred percent higher conversion rates why because they know who you are they know who you are and they like what you have so how do we go and do this once we have the ad how do we go and create the ad it's really simple first one go down here we're gonna go to our shared library and AdWords and we're gonna go and create a of anybody dispute our videos in the last two days easy okay there's a few videos on the channel too to kind of teach you some bit more and I'm also gonna give you a way to like do this here in a second now next thing you want to do we're gonna go and create an ad I'm gonna keep this one pretty simple okay and for everybody turning in right here just for everybody hopping on just show any kind of what we're talking about we're talking to how we're doing an extra 10k day on a YouTube you can see we spent about eleven thousand dollars a day and we've already made about another thousand dollars we're doing about we're at about forty thousand in sales today from all the businesses actually I think I don't know where we got we got another processes are right here and we got PayPal per source wave and stuff like that so it's going good going good so if you're interesting that and listen up so what we're then going to do is we're gonna go and create an that so how do we create an ad we're just gonna go right here and we're gonna get create an ad do I'm not gonna show it let me just show you can I have what it looks like so there you go really simple you just link to your page and everything like that and what you want to do in your video targeting is you come over here we're gonna go to remarketing and then we're just gonna simply target what are you doing we're gonna target everybody that's viewed see all sorts of videos like if you viewed this video right here I'm gonna target you with the consulting ad if you viewed you with this if you viewed this ad it just goes on if you viewed a Shopify video I'm gonna target with this alright this ad set this one hundred forty thousand people right here is worth like Lisl e 5k a day to me so I'm just gonna go and do recent views if you viewed my video in the past one day hit save boom we're running an ad and here's the most beautiful thing guys it's gonna be dirt cheap to do this and so instead of going out there like every other person out there and targeting a bunch of people that don't know you you're gonna start your first Shopify store only targeting people or your first digital marketing store whatever targeting people that like that have did you have rapport with trust with and respect now here's the thing let me let's look at a few ways you could really monetize this first off imagine you had a survival brand or any brand losing weight juicing shaving cats if you're into that type of thing and what you're gonna do is we can go and then target them let's imagine we get us membership and it's 47 bucks a month and we give them a free trial so let's imagine that these 10,000 people that view a video we get 200 of them to sign up for a free trial 200 if we get just fifty percent of those people to convert that's a hundred people that's forty seven hundred bucks a month year-round that's forty that's like about fifty sixty thousand bucks a year one video 10,000 people gimme an X if that kind of gets you excited like that if you see the potential right there that's why I think reoccurring memberships especially where you coach is the best way to get started ever pretty cool right yeah one video 10,000 people let's imagine guys you upload a video every single day or three times a week for a month and you're able to rack up 30,000 retargeting viewers you got these people for free all you need to do is get 200 of them to convert now what else let's imagine you have a brand where you teach people for lack of better words let's say you help businesses that's a little name one you help people learn Facebook Ads okay you make a video about Facebook advertising and then you retarget people right after soon let's say you're not gonna give them any views both so you get 3000 views you retarget everybody right after asking what they want to sign up for a consultation call where you'll help them with your Facebook Ads if you get 3000 people and you get to that with you for a thousand dollars a month paid traffic management that's 2,000 bucks a month 24 K a year from one video that's the greasy hot goodness I'm talking about right here that's the bigger picture you need to look at right here for example guys if I make a Shopify video Oh wonder what I'm you've never seen me be one of those yeah this keeps going like here we go ten days hundred dollars a day hacking shop by sellers 10k 10k so I got 24 people right there so 24 K people if I get 10 of those people to buy H come 2020 I just made 20 great okay okay but if I can get three of those people at a twenty four thousand you've just watched this video that's sixty thousand dollars in my bank account and it's a little bit more obvious how I'm able to go and generate see I just made another 500 bucks is sitting right here okay so it's pretty it's pretty obvious how I'm able to go out there and generate an extra 30 to 40 sometimes 50k a day on even crazy days eighty thousand dollars a day just going out there and using a lot of this is a my only tactic I run a lot of cold traffic ads as well a lot of cold traffic ads but this right here is responsible for about an extra tank a day and sales so I have a question for you guys how many people give me a three if you want three more if someone said how do you do loan law or a lot of questions hold up give me a three if you want more information like this okay you want this like in depth you want this process mapped out okay here's the crazy thing I'm about to do if you've been on any of my live streams before you probably know hey it then Alex Lee usually likes to pitch hold on to your butt's for

well if you don't like doing videos then you know you can't really do that someone actually did too many questions pouring and there's a lot of people gumming in so I'm gonna teach one more tactic about YouTube okay all right so if someone said I bought it already I'll buy it again for this put in the dollar put in a dollar okay and guys again I just go nuts in here again the person I'd the person I see going nuts the motions chat is gonna get a CH come 2020 okay so all right so I'm gonna teach you one more tactic before I hop off again the URL is directly below this video so this is pretty crazy so if you go on Facebook guys the hardest challenge most people have is when they go and run their first ads they only target interest that's really hard because I want to tell you something about your ads I'm gonna let's say you're selling a workout set all right you saw barbells and you're gonna go and target people that like bodybuilding but I'm gonna tell you right away that targeting someone just because they like bodybuilding doesn't necessarily mean they're your perfect customer for barbells you don't and so what Facebook gives you the option to do is create look-alike audiences and so what Facebook will do is if you give them enough examples of people they'll go out there and find a million people just like those people that right there is a far better audience because the perfect person for your dumbbells is probably a male 25 to 34 takes protein supplements lives in New Jersey close to the beach okay because he's a Guido that's gonna be your target marker and so what's gonna happen let's imagine we go and put up a YouTube video so we put up a video and then we run an ad to every single person to view that video so here's workout Wally okay we run an ad on YouTube to this guy alright so Bam Bam now what's gonna happen is when this is gonna look so ugly when work out Wally comes to your website he's gonna get recorded Facebook's gonna go ah workout Wally this man is 25 to 34 eats a lot of Cheetos and has an addiction to protein powder and pre-workout supplements ah I know the perfect customer for this guy and so you said about 50 to 100 of these guys to your site and then when Facebook is gonna let you do is create a look-alike audience of a million people just like this guy and here's the shortcut instead of starting off your Shopify ads or your even your digital marketing ads to people that are not your target customer you have facebook a little ego and create an audience just for you of people that are just like the people that are visiting your website organically for the most part because they are people that are watching your videos organically a guided system and watches a ten minute video on pre-workout supplements it's probably gonna be interested in pre-workout supplements don't you think and so when you're in an ad to them and SCIM to your site and you get a hundred people that are interested in pre-workout supplements to your site face it's gonna go ah I see this is the key and then it's gonna go and give you that perfect look-alike audience give me next up that's pretty cool I'm gonna give away the copy of H com 2022 Chris oh my gosh what it what a what a at the comments oh yeah look at those X's yeah all right yeah it gets me going guys all right so look guys that is tonight's livestream we're having another one tomorrow 8:00 p.m. Eastern problem you might stream in the middle of day actually I'm probably on doing like random live streams all the time at random times just like that so look guys I'm begging you right now I'm begging you come check out I'm gonna show you this real quick come get the video marketing accelerator it's gonna show you step by step everything I've done tonight down to an insane detail exactly how I'm generating like guys again the numbers don't lie it's gonna show you exactly I'm not how I'm doing all right so if we look at this right here where's the there

thousand dollars back to the rest of this is in PayPal and more importantly show me how we had generated an extra ten kid and I really want you to see the final potential here guys remember what we talked about if you go and run a survival video you get 30,000 views here out the month if you can get just a hundred people or 200 people to try a free trial and convert at 50% and pay you 47 bucks a month you're making forty seven hundred bucks a month that's the potential here if you get a video that has a lot of views you get people to that video you get just a super small minority a hundred people out of 30,000 on a forty seven dollar per month program you are now financially free congratulations imagine this you go and create a video teaching people how to do Facebook ads you get three thousand people to view that video you run an ad right after that video that you just you get all these people for free these people now trust you they like you and they respect you you get two of those people at a three thousand to converted a thousand dollars per month pay traffic management after they already like you boom that's 24 K a year you make five or six of those videos you get five or six clients boom you're financially free you make a survival video okay you get 10k views this is why I'm really a big fan of reoccurring stuff because reoccurring stuff makes the most money just keep that in mind but let's imagine we get 10,000 views and you make the video showcasing the tent a little bit you get just 20 of those people to buy of $200 tent you just made 4000 bucks for the
