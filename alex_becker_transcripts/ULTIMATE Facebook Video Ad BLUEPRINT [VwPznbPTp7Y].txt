================================================================================

most people are terrible at facebook video ads they just are it's not an insult it's not a dig it's just not these aren't going to convert guys what i'm going to show in this video is exactly what will make your videos convert much higher this is in terms of clicks but this is also in terms of people landing on the page in a much more likely to buy state okay if you understand how to start videos with the same the middle videos the proper length and how the format the colors the text all these little things that are actually really important on where the eye lands in the video you're going to get such better results from your ads okay so why am i telling you this well straight up i'm the ceo of hiros it's the fastest growing ad attribution company in the world because um we basically guarantee results people consistently at least see a 15 20 increase in their ad roi from our a optimization and print tracking or they don't pay but what that gives me is a little special insight on how our industry works and evolves and i'll never share anyone's data i will show you the trends in industry and what i've learned from growing two businesses to eight figures almost exclusively from ads so that being said let's hop in the value because i'm going to show you exactly how to make your videos convert so much higher if you just do this it's simple it's easy and it could actually go and increase your business significantly because if you get more clicks at a cheaper cost that's going to give you cheaper conversions and more of them that can be a big result if you get like a 20 50 more increase from that and it's quite simple to do if you just listen to this let's get into it okay guys so like always i'm just going to get into this i'm really going to be comparing ads that i just don't think are optimal to my ads that have performed very optimally okay again i'm not taking digs at these businesses i'm not here to i'm not here to smack them or anything like that i just from my experience seeing tons of ads working at hiros these aren't optimal so let's just get started with the most important thing when it comes to video ads judging your video ads performance what most people get lost in is they look at the cost per view and the cost per click this is pretty irrelevant are these things relevant in the in a micro scale yes but the only thing that really matters is your cost per acquisition and then overall your revenue you have to understand that i could get an amazingly low cost per view on my video ads if i just put a cat on it and just rambled and made the cat do cute things i could go and get very low cost per clicks if i say click here and you'll get free things this doesn't mean the ads can perform well you need to understand that your goal with that is to attract your target customer and if you're really attracting your target customer sometimes your cost per viewing cost per click will be expensive what is important is that you attract people and put them in a state of mind to perform well on your landing page that is going to be reflected in your cost per acquisition whether it's cost per call cost per lead or short-term cost per sale that's super important to understand because if you send the wrong people to the page cheaply you're going to have a very high cost per acquisition so what i'm going to tell you straight up is a lot of people are going to disagree with us i don't care don't pay attention to your cost per click or cost per view it's irrelevant what you need to be paying to is cost per acquisition and more so cost or total revenue back in okay which is again why you should be using hiros because you can see facebook is missing calls all the time right here i would not have the right it's over reporting and some of them under reporting and it's not catching my call conversion so i can see calls that converted a week after to click and actually get my true roi this is what i judge my ads by and the reason for that is because if you were attracting the wrong people you're not going to get the actual results that matter okay and you can spend all day optimizing your cost per viewing cost per click this right here gets the right person to my page and then i'm able to look at the revenue numbers and actually judge it as a good ad by the cost per call and the revenue generated okay so again do those things now here's the most important thing with video ads there needs to be something to entice the person to watch them i this this is so straightforward we look at this ad right here design pickle it starts the video off the thumbnails i'm sitting around with garyvee and you really can't even recognize garyvee if we're scrolling through this ad right here like this we're not gonna recognize garyvee and frankly that's irrelevant because i'm not gonna buy something because they're sitting down with garyvee this doesn't tell me what the proc does for me doesn't tell me why i should be interested look at this ad right here the most important thing first off is i'm using all the tactics from the last video to draw the eye in on the purple stick people want to know what's on this stick they go what's on the stick that's that's exactly why i'm doing this create a question that gets a person to look at that present the benefit of watching the ad our tracking ai will scale your ads or you don't pay let's talk about this headline real quick ai is a buzzword that gets people interested they make something it's something new cutting edge that they're missing out on something we'll scale your ads you don't pay a person that run ads is gonna go wait buzzword guaranteed results explain lower ion buzzword slash interesting context subject guaranteed result that they're super interested in this lures people in like that okay so we go and look at a lot of these ads right here we can look at like i'm not i'm not here to pick on wiki reports we do enough of that at high rows but if we look at wicker reports right here you start the video you don't know what are we what are we watching right here why what what is the benefit to watching this video behind the scenes with clickfunnels and it's it's already it's a tiny text right here what's the benefit click funnels trust wiki reports what what is the benefit to a person running ads i don't even know this is a company that tracks ads we just see a guy sitting here talking so all right whatever uh we go down and actually look at some other ads right here let's go look at some i i believe i saw a good one right here okay so video starts off it's muted of course we don't where is the thing that hooks the viewer in tells them the benefit they're watching okay ppp performance framework not for beginners this doesn't tell me the benefit if you look at this ad right here our tracking ai hooks you in buzzword blue stick guaranteed result hooks them in like that now another thing you're not going to see on ads like for example we saw like the wiki reports ad they don't have they didn't have subtitles people you literally can't get people to click your ads so what makes you think they're actually going here and turn on the sound while they're on their phone like you see someone in an airport being like just skimming through facebook and being like oh yeah you know what i want to hear right now a bunch of noise no they don't do that that's why you need to use something like veed not the facebook caption manager because it doesn't always show up to just slap the subtitles and really big well-positioned clean text that people can read because people most of the time aren't going to turn on sound on your ad okay so that's the next thing now first five seconds if you run ads this ai tracking script will scale your ads at least 20 further and get you customers as much as 52 cheaper i guarantee it what's what's the benefit i'm offering what is this ad about what are people going to get and what is the big gain they're going to achieve if they click this ad it's all explained in the first if you're a person that runs ads and cares about making more money this video has your attention at this point at this point all i'm doing in this video ad is that first eight seconds focus on who is your target customer what are they most interested in and how can you make it extremely enticing to continue to watch the video the way i do it in this one i say this stuff is going to get you this result this result in a new cutting-edge way i guarantee it it's like whoa all right this is new and cutting edge and he guarantees that house is going to go down a lot of people start their ads with rambling or they're walking around their house get to the point and tell people what they're going to gain okay what they're going to see so for example when i was doing an info ad info ads in the past i said the next 45 seconds i'm going to show you how we made 45 000 selling this wolf mug okay for my youtube mastermind ads okay that i'll run i'm gonna say this ad right here this powerpoint presentation did two million dollars in sales i'm going to show you exactly the ad targeting that i used on youtube what's the person getting in the first five seconds there you go that hooks them they want to see the rest of it so at this point right here i just follow a really simple pattern that's really covered in our youtube uh ad script is also on this channel as well and i want to really express one thing to you guys this first five seconds and the things we just covered is 90 of the battle all right most people are not going to watch past the first 10 seconds now now that we're into the first 10 seconds customers as much as 52 cheaper i guarantee it no literally guarantee this is called hyrus and if it doesn't get you those results you don't pay for it and that's why so that there's a huge hook right here so the the thing i like to do is i like to present a huge hook and explain the benefit behind it okay especially on facebook where we only have about 60 seconds we don't need a five-minute ad on facebook you want a 60-second ad okay then what i do is i back it up i back up the big crazy challenge so i make a big challenge statement then i back it up big brands like clickfunnels.com tombylow's impact theory dot com ingrazios and tonyrom's mastermind dot com six seven eight and nine figure ecommerce brands like ladyboss.com those and ads leaders you get it so i back it up and this way the way in this video i back it up is i just show the brands that are using hyrus in my info ads i show the results of our customers and people talking about it and then mentioning the product all right all right show our results on there so i back it up with proof like dan henry and even one of the highest revenue click funnels funnels of all time alex marsey's gymlodge.com they all use this too and so do hundreds of other businesses and frankly if you're not using it too you're at a massive disadvantage because frankly you're paying way too much to get a customer then after i back it up i induce fear and fomo you can see i did exactly right there this thing does incredible things here's proof that it does here's proof here's the fact the the sad truth that you're missing out who all right this thing is amazing everybody else is using it you're not using it that gets people hooked in there okay and then when i do at the end of this at the end of every video it's very simple very simple close i don't have time to explain it all here i will break down everything in extreme detail and give you every aspect of how it works if you click this ad same thing with info ads look i just showed you that this concept right here is making people a ton of money here's a ton of money people that made a ton of money doing it look they're all making money and you're missing on this thing that is just sitting right here it's a huge opportunity i can't explain it all in a 60-second video of course so click this ad and i'll show you exactly how it works we'll give you a template on how to do it we'll give you the scripts we'll give the yada yada so we wrap it up with a call to action to get something laid out extremely easy whatever because when you use print tracking plus ai optimization you pay much less you can scale much further you get customers cheaper you can bid more competitively and if you click this ad i'll explain in extreme detail how it all works and we will even set this up for you and we will also guarantee the results i've talked about that's it that's how simple a facebook ad can be you can see how easy it is hook them back it up create fomo call to action people don't watch five minute facebook i've never watched a video on facebook have you have you i don't i mean if i'm watching videos i'm on youtube i don't i don't ever sit around and watch videos on facebook like ever because the way facebook is set up is so unoptimal for watching videos it's meant to keep you scrolling they don't want you watching videos the more you scroll the more ads you see so it's not set to get you watching a video youtube wants you to watch videos because the more videos you watch the more ads you see it wants you to skip from video to video to video facebook wants you to scroll okay it wants you to spend as little time as possible on there so the site isn't designed to get you to watch videos so what do you do keep the video short hit hard use those subtitles make sure to hook the person with a with an appropriate headline in the video itself this is your biggest headline space in the entire ad use it use it do not have an ad that just says nothing do not start your ads off in a vague way okay and for the love of holy monkey holy moliness make it abundantly clear who you're at is for what the benefit is and abundantly clear what they're going to get for watching the ad okay like almost every ad we've skimmed through you like what is this what does this ad actually do make your ads stand what are we getting right here hey let's keep going through these ads right here okay i love magics strong roi and free to try this is much better okay uh magix is one of the people we actually kind of partner with with our integrations so look they're literally going for this is a great ad this is a great ad actually you know um i was worried i was gonna have to poop on magics for a second here's another one right old way to plan marketing from a new this doesn't this doesn't if someone builds funnels what does the old way versus the new way have to do with them [Music] what is the benefit of what we're seeing right here how's this so this stuff right here guys is just really chronic when it comes to facebook if you don't do this the right way you're going to be looking at weird metrics like cost per view and cost per click and you're not going to be getting the most important thing which is the cost per acquisition for sale at the levels you want to be so this has worked abundantly well for me it's so simple it makes it easy to make ads very quickly high level produce and i think you should use it so that being said guys if you're interested in increasing use if you're not tracking your revenue and your inspiration accurately you're not spending your money that's simple that if you want to help scaling your hands my headmaster has more results literally guaranteed if you don't see and i'll see you in the next video you
