look this is simple i'm just going to show you what you should be selling on facebook and youtube ads right now now look being the ceo of hiros it allows me to see exactly what's working across entire industries across entire ad platforms now let's back up for a second yes we are tracking literally almost hundreds of millions of dollars a month in product sales that being said i'm never going to share any exact tactics or strategies or what my clients are doing on there i'm never going to say oh this is what so-and-so is doing you should just copy this what i am able to share with you though and what i am comfortable sharing is what i see industry trend wise working and when it comes to facebook ads when it comes to youtube ads there's very particular set of funnels there's a very particular style of offers they're just working very very well and the reason i feel comfortable sharing this with you is you can easily see this on facebook and youtube you just don't know which ones are working and which ones are not there's a whole range of junk you're being shown on these platforms and if you understand what is converting really well right here what type of pricing what type of funnels are working you're gonna absolutely kill it you're gonna absolutely crush it this because people that get this they're doing very well so i think it's probably gonna be one of the most useful videos i share in this channel so without further ado we're just gonna hop into this all right guys so let's just let's just get into this there's three types of offers they're killing it right now the first type of offer that i see absolutely nuking it right now is call funnel offers for products that are above eight thousand dollars in the info marketing space two specific b2b industries let me explain this so ignore my chicken scratch though so what does it call funnel first off i'm gonna get into this in the next video where i get into the best funnels and i break them down and i'm going to explain every part of them but a call funnel for lack of better words is this we send people this is an example of a funnel that i'm running ads from for hirose and a person lands on this page from a facebook or youtube ad they enter their email and then get taken to a page with a simple sales video uh making an offer and i'll explain this more specifically here in a moment but i just want to show you because the person lands on this page they see the sales video they see that we got like basically every big person on planet earth using hieros for tracking their ad optimization and then they come down here and they book call okay so this is essentially how we've been growing high road slots one of the ways we've created one of the fastest growing tracking companies actually i think the fastest growing in the world right now that being said that's not what i'm telling you to make here i'm not saying make a sas company okay because i want to talk about offers that you can readily get accessible to though i think right now one of the biggest opportunities in sas marketing is having a high ticket sas software sold through a call funnel but this is what i'm seeing right here more so info products and done-for-you service products to specific industries now i'm not mentioning any industries that i've seen in highrose i'm just giving generic examples out there for example thinking about dental offices surgeons roofing contractors hair salons these type of offers to brick and mortar businesses where you can give them strategies and ways to increase their sales i've seen working like crazy and what i mean by crazy is when i look at and i go to masterminds or i go to ad conferences or i look at the trends across the entire ad industry what i'm seeing in this is this is usually the ads that are generating the highest roi i'm talking people putting in three thousand dollars and making i don't know 30 to 40 000 back i see that very consistently these 10x juicy rois and so if you're thinking about starting a business are you thinking about scaling up your business you're thinking about ways to grow it this type of funnel right here and this type of offer to specific brick and mortar b2b businesses absolutely super duper duper juicy right here the one thing i got to stress is that when you're running a funnel like this the first thing you got to do especially if you have multiple different traffic sources coming in just in general you can see right here if i'm going and using highrose tracking right here you can see the amount of calls that are actually reported by facebook and what actually comes into your business is wildly different because of view throughs and repeated pixel loadings and double pixeling of a person multiple traffic sources taking credit organic sources actually generating the sale and facebook not joining our sale just goes on and on and on that being said you can see alright right here i've tracked three calls right here reported two there were six calls right here reported eight i tracked seven right here at reported four and if i go in the highest and actually look at my calls coming in i don't have calls not being attributed i can go in and look at a call and see every single ad they've clicked in fact this person clicked last year in october and they didn't book a call until this month almost a year later and so i tracked all of that so i'm seeing all that and i need to use that accurate data a lot of people that are running call funnels right now they're not using accurate data so they're getting really weird cost per call and then even worse when they're running their ads they're not operating based on profit because you can't track call closes very well on facebook right now at all you can see right here in the report column what facebook caught nothing because it just can't track that and so running a call funnel without being able to track the calls accurately and the money coming in because sometimes you can have a ton of good calls a good call cost per call but it's not generating any money that's bad okay you don't pay for calls aren't generating money if you're not tracking those things you're going to have a really wonky call funnel i'll just leave it at that but if you can do that you're in a juicy spot right now now the next type of offer that's working exceptionally well that i've seen is webinar offers to odd side hustles okay so what does this mean this is another info product i'm going to get into an e-commerce product here in a second i think it's working really really well but webinar offers where you're selling something for the price of 497 to 997 that doesn't take a specific make money online model you might see people offering amazon fba and like tai lopez courses and whatnot i don't think that really works very well anymore what i think works absolute best is having an offer from 497 to 987 to 2 000 this sold via a webinar funnel outside of the make money online space so if you're a make money online person you probably you can still do this it works exceptionally well but if you want to be seeing like eight 10x rois what you want to be doing is what i see people doing is they're offering side hustles so i'm just gonna make something up here like for example if you could make extra money selling juice or something like that or extra money learning how to start your own side makeup artist business what people are looking for online it's working really really well right now is finding ways to make little side hustles to make an extra 100 300 500 bucks a month people don't want to start fully fledged businesses for example i'm comfortable talking about this i saw like dr axe offering some offer who was talking about how to become a licensed ascension essential oil consultant whatever that is those type of offers killing it right now those are what that's what people really want to buy in the info space if you're selling information and so what a webinar funnel is is you have an opt-in you send people to maybe an hour-long presentation that ends with an offer for a 497 product to a 2 000 product but usually what i'm seeing best is like 497 to 9.97 okay that's what i see working just across the entire industry in mastermind and ad events and whatnot and you might be wondering first off two questions one why why are we only doing high ticket stuff right now it's because simply put high ticket works better because if it's much easier to get three people out of a hundred to buy a thousand dollar product than it is to get thirty people out of a hundred to buy a hundred dollar product that's just how the numbers work out usually you're going to have three people that are hyper interested six people 10 people it's very hard to get 30 percent of people that come through a funnel they'll all spend a hundred dollars it's much easier to get three of them to each spend a thousand dollars and so the reason why you want to do high tick is it simply works so much better so let's simply imagine we're paying two dollars to get a person to sign up for a webinar and we got a thousand people to sign up all right so we got or we had to spend two thousand dollars now if we can just get three of those people to spend a thousand dollars we're at a three thousand dollar revenue one thousand dollar profit kind of situation now same situation if we're selling a hundred dollar product and we got 10 of people to buy which is extremely hard to do okay let's just see even 20 percent of people we got 20 of people to buy we're at 2 000 revenue and a no money situation just by simply playing with these numbers right here and by the way getting a 20 conversion rate on that that's toasty that's that's really hard to do getting a three percent conversion rate on an ad isn't really that hard even at the higher tickets okay so that's why i see on sleep see people in my ad mastermind the vast majority of them run webinars and the ones that have gone from like i don't know 20k a month i saw one of them go to 400k a month literally using that type of strategy going purely high ticket that's like the big change when they suddenly stop selling stuff for a hundred dollars and then go and start selling it for one thousand to two thousand dollars and again these are people that have experience with that this isn't some beginner stuff and a lot of the reason why they're able to do is they just literally go and copy all the ad copying funnels that i use to scale my my info product actual webinar to eight figures and so just go and copy that but it's not about copying it it's not about the mass running of that junk right there i'm just saying that the big thing that helped me a lot was increasing at the high ticket and then running that type of webinar funnel specifically out of where webinar funnels are being ran right now for example in the make money online niche people they're running them everywhere that's why it's very hard to make like more than a two to three x ro on your ads when you break outside of this niche and start selling other type of products like that works super duper well finally the last funnel i've seen and this is just a general business i'm aware of that i actually saw us working with and i started seeing it everywhere else is extremely high ticket e-commerce so a lot of people in e-commerce they're working with like low-ticket items or 27 to 29 to 100 that's like the cap that i see a lot of times what i'm seeing in e-commerce that absolutely crushes it is 20 thousand dollar-ish products plus absolutely crushes and the funnels that i'm seeing it's so comical because the thing is people don't go shopping let's just say for example for solar panels they don't go to a solar panel store they browse around online and the thing is you can almost exclusively have a lockdown on these type of offers if you run them online and the thing is you don't have to have a complicated funnel because a lot of people are already looking for these offers for example i'm in the market right now for an infrared sauna and it's expensive it's like 10 grand i'm not gonna where am i going to go shop for this for brick and mortar i'm exclusively going to look for it online and the thing is it's not going to take a lot for me to book a call i just need a good general sales page and this is where it's really fun to me because a lot of these e-commerce businesses they're just sending people just strictly to a sales page there's there's not a call funnel there's no opt-in or anything going on they just have information that talks about the product and then hey you got to book a call with us there's no price or anything at that this right here just simple ad talking about the benefits of the product a simple sales page doing that and then just offering a sales call funnel at the bottom this is generating some of the most comical products that i'm seeing from ads right now because you have an exclusive iron-clad lockdown on this market right here and the people don't need to be sold as much as if you're selling info products which is what a lot of people are trying to do with high-ticket phone calls or for done-for-you services right now a person knows if they want for example solar panels person knows that they want an infrared sauna okay you don't have to go too far out of your way to convince people to do this especially when they're watching all the benefits on you you can literally just go to youtube right now and target people that are watching for example solar panel videos you can target people that are watching infrared sauna videos they're so easy to target and they're already pre-sold by what's on youtube so it blows my mind this right here is this is the nuclear bomb right here so these are the three types of offers that are killing it right now my big suggestion to you look in the high ticket again like i showed you before i'm just looking at my higher horse mad manager with my extension and right now you're going to see the call volumes on a lot of these different funnels are radically different than what's actually coming in especially when you go and actually track your ltv of your ads so for like example i can come in here and say how much is this call worth to me and you saw before it takes almost a year for a person to book a phone call and in some examples so i need to know the long-term ltv of people that put calls with us so as you can see right here i make 750 dollars after six months from every single phone call and so we're usually paying like 150 200 bucks per call and so if i'm looking at the face value of the funnel it's not too great over six months it's ridiculous though and so this is really how i run my business if you want help setting up tracking like this just schedule consultation with us below at hiros and we'll literally just look in your ad account find where all the waste is and all the bad data is if you have it and then we can just set it up for you and on top of that if you want to get on that mastermind i mentioned before we don't just let anybody in but if you want to get an analysis of your ads and have me actually hop on a call with you review your ads point out what type of funnel you should be running what type of targeting you should be using basically giving you all the copy and whatnot that i talked about that i've given to other people just go and book a consultation with me below and we can hop on and do that that being said hopefully enjoyed this free content today if you want to see more content like this subscribe to the channel and also go to facebook and just search for the hi-ros facebook group we have a qualification process to get in but if you pass a qualification process there's over 50 million a month in ad spend from our media buyers in that group meaning that if you combine everyone together that's how much you're all spending it is a treasure trove of actual ad running knowledge so go check out those things i also put some videos at the end of the video for you and if you have any questions go one post in the comment section below on youtube and i try within the first 24 hours answer questions so that's it i'll see you next video you
