hashtag urination what's going on this is alex becker again and you open email number two in the v email challenge if you open three more you can get that six hundred dollar course but look we're not here to talk about the course we're here to talk about how you explode your Shopify store so what I'm gonna show you in this video is attack that I've seen so many companies use in fact I'm gonna show you a company that 100 million their first year in e-commerce and if you do any type of drop shipping any type of e-commerce whatsoever what I'm gonna show you right here makes it insanely easy to get a 5 to 10 X return on your Facebook Ads your YouTube ads and if you're using free traffic it's just insane the amount of numbers you can do and the way you do this is by focusing on the one thing that most ecommerce stores forget their back-end I'm just gonna put out a very simple scenario for you right now let's imagine you have a $10 t-shirt and so in order for you to make money on that t-shirt you need to get a person to buy for at least $5 that could be pretty difficult with your Facebook ads but what if you had a way to consistently get a person that bought that $10 t-shirt to come back a month from now and buy a $20 t-shirt and then come back two months from now and buy a $30 gadget and then come back three months from now and buy another $15 t-shirt that $10 sale would actually be worth close to forty to fifty dollars in extra business so how would that change your advertising instead of having to go out there and pay $5 to get a $10 so you could spend $12 and get that $10 sale because you know over the next three months you're gonna make 40 to 50 more dollars back that's insane that completely changes how you run ads because suddenly you're not working with these small little budgets where you can't scale cuz it's difficult something you can go out there and actually spend some real money and you're making that 5x return that allows your store to blow up because you can get really aggressive with your paid ads it's it's hard it's hard when you're working with really tight numbers like a ten dollar sale you have to get it for five bucks that's difficult going out there and getting a 10 dollar sale for $10 and in getting the extra $40 in sales coming in aka literally for Xing your money is fairly simple to do if you just follow the tactics on it and this is how so many stores to sell every big really smart brand online operates proactive the brand I'm going to show you and tons and tons of supplement companies I've researched this is exactly how they operate in fact they lose money on the front of their ads don't worry we're not gonna be doing that here but if you apply this right here it makes your ads 5 times more problem if you just tack this on what you're already doing you will make 5x the prof because these methods right here are not hard to apply it is simply getting people to come back to your store and buy more and that's the cheapest traffic source on earth because you control that traffic source via your emails so we're gonna hop in my computer right now and I'm gonna show you this works alright so where my computer and I can't stress this enough I've done massive amounts of research on companies like vouchers did one hundred million dollars their first year in fact it's Spectre my nootropic and supplement an anti-aging company we literally follow most of very similar funnels to it I'm gonna show you exactly where we make most of our money at and I've listened extensively deliver Firestone and I'm not gonna tell you exactly what he's doing I'm not going to speak for him anything of that but this is one of the brands I one of the brand's he runs boom and I literally by speaking to a ton of people in his mastermind stuff like that the biggest e-commerce businesses they make so much more of their money from retargeting and repeat customers and not that first sale and where I see so many e-commerce people messing up is this is what their business looks like they run an ad to their product and this is it like this is where the money is made and this is so this is so bad this is so incredibly bad and if you listen to what I'm gonna say in this video you will three to five extra store it is virtually impossible for you not to and it's a few clicks away so just please give me a little bit of attention right here bear with me because we're every other business is making their money is this is where most noobs and stupid businesses make their money or most other businesses make their money is back here after the sale because everything that is sold right here is free or much much cheaper than selling this first sale in fact the most expensive cost least cost efficient way to get customers it's focusing on making money on the first sale this will always have the lowest Ori by far and the stuff in the back end whether you're doing retargeting or email marketing or facebook messenger marketing I'm going to show you will always always always have the most profitable return by far always in all ways and so I'm going to show you three very simple ways in this video to explode your business actually four if we get into a bonus once so this one right here is single handily the biggest L T V if you pay attention just this one thing at more than anything else in this video your business will double it is impossible for you not to because the way you will run your business will change forever so I want to breakdown to you who's gonna make more money right here so this is how most people work let's imagine you both are selling a $10 t-shirt so you run an ad and you sell $10 t-shirt in order to get the profit from this let's imagine there's no hard cost of selling the shirt anything like that in order to make a profit right here you need to get a sale or a good prop you need to get that sale for like at least five to six bucks now that's pretty tight what does this mean if this if this is where your business stops at you have to be play a pretty tiptoe II game with your Facebook Ads you can't get aggressive like you need to only go and focus on traffic it's gonna get you this five to six star sale and what's gonna happen is eventually this is gonna become almost impossible to do as e-commerce becomes more competitive but you're having a bid very low and you're having to be very not aggressive because your business stops right here now who's gonna make more money right here this is how most multi seven-figure are eight figure or nine figure e-commerce businesses work there's an ad and let's imagine they're selling that ten dollar t-shirt but what they'll do is they'll spend $12 to get that 10 dollar sale now first off let's just focus on this right here who's gonna get most of the traffic who's gonna be able to scale their traffic further you are this person this person is they can pay $12 per sale but see you're making about probably four dollars profit right here there's no hard cost in shirts even lower when we bring an e-commerce hard cost which I'm not gonna deal with in this video because it just it brings a whole nother realm of math problems to this now let's imagine this guy right here they go and for every sale right here they are able to go and on average get a person to come back two weeks later and buy another $10 shirt and on average they're able to get a person to come in 30 days later and buy a $15.00 hat and then within three months on average people come in and buy at least one more mug or something like that for let's say 10 bucks each $10 sale right here where they've lost $2 but in the back end they just made 10 25 $35 so this ad right here even though they are losing money they are making almost six times more than you seven times more than you in their back end because the long-term value of each customer that comes in is their $35 do you do this I really don't think so most beginning Shopify businesses don't do this at all whereas literally inside a market here oh let me show you this all right so this is this is my autoresponder this is my email platform but more important this is the only system on planet earth they can do what I'm about to show you and get you this number with ease because the second you plug your Shopify store into market hero it is 100% automated when I'm over the shoes 110 I may not look I'm not gonna do any crazy pitch or anything like this the cold simple fact is market here is the only software platform that connects to your email and Facebook messenger and allows you to get these numbers there's nothing else on planet earth that does this in an automated fashion you have to combine like three other systems Infusionsoft a ton of other confusing stuff to get these numbers so check this out because I can't make it any more clear than this so here's this one product I sold called source machine from one of my businesses so let's imagine this is your e-commerce product now this product right here is $99 when a person buys it so you would think if I was running ads I'd have to clear at least I'd have to get the sale for less than $99 to make money absolutely wrong absolutely wrong and what we want to do with our ads is we want to scale them as far as possible so we want to be able to spend as much as possible and make money the more you can afford the span ads the faster your business grows so I got these people right here that bought this product let's see how much money they're worth to me over six months and wherever this is a $99 sale they're worth $180 to me okay you can see literally the extra money they bring in boom bam within ten weeks they're worth eighty three extra dollars to me within week 20 they're worth 121 dollars to me they're worth a hundred eighty extra dollars to me after the initial sale what what does that mean what does that mean for the entire business okay these are the people that come in on average of a person buys this they spend this much money with me how does this change my business if I know I'm gonna make a hundred eighty extra dollars over six months from I can spend a hundred and fifty dollars getting a ninety nine dollar sale getting that person my business because I know they're gonna come and spend a hundred eighty dollars how does that change your e-commerce business it changes everything it changes everything and really going in and I'm going to show you how simple this integration is here in a second integrating this and pulling all your data from your store literally in a second I can click the store and what it will do is pull all my sales and I'm going to show you this it will pull all my sales pull the entire data from my store and then show me the LTV of all my products what you're probably gonna see is a lot of procs that you have are actually making you way more money and you think you're going to see that you've sold a mug but those people that buy a mug on average are buying this this and this and you can build funnels around that which ties into our next our next system that's going on right here so you need to be able to go and automate sales based on your customers behaviors which is extremely easy now look market hero does abandon carts it actually bought plugs in the facebook Messenger there's so many other things I want to show you the things that are so different that we do is look you can go and tag someone based on what they buy so let's imagine they go and they bought this product alright so that the dollar sign is what happens when they get tagged with a product purchase this happens automatically in Shopify for you these products these tags are automatically generated so what I can do is as soon as this purchase is done I can go and send them an email offering them something else okay I can say okay cool they purchase this product what I want to do is I want to send this email to sending them something else and so what I can do is I can then go and then sort by tag okay so I'm gonna set it to wait three days and if they don't buy this product within three days what it's gonna do is it's gonna sell them another product okay so let's imagine they just bought let's say I have a Star Wars merch store alright so they just bought a shirt that says Luke Skywalker is the best so I can have an email automatically fire that sends them a Luke Skywalker painting or poster or hoodie or something like that now if they don't buy this let's imagine oh maybe they're sick of Luke Skywalker stuff what we want to do is we're gonna send them a Darth Vader mug right here so if they don't buy they're gonna go down the nose sequence so we're gonna do is we're to summon Darth Vader hoodie instead if they buy in another Luke Skywalker think man this person must really love Luke Skywalker what we can do is we can send him another email right here going and sending them another Luke Skywalker product okay and we can just we can literally just keep doing this over and over again so if they buy the hoodie I could have something like hey complete the collection get this thing and then what happens is if they don't buy this thing let's imagine they don't buy that I can go and sort them by their what they purchase so let's say source hunter right here is what they didn't purchase so what we can do as let's imagine they've gone through we just sold them another Luke Skywalker sure after they bought the first leg Skywalker shirt then we said okay complete the collection get the hoodie now if they buy the hoodie and we're all to Luke Skywalker stuff guess what we want to do now get them down to Darth Vader funnel say all right look you got all the Luke Skywalker stuff you could possibly get get the Darth Vader funnel now also right here if they don't complete the Luke Skywalker collection we can send another email saying hey what type what's your favorite character who do you want to see next and so then what we could do easily right here is we could go all right cool so this person go and they click Anakin Skywalker link all right so they don't like Luke Skywalker they want Anakin Skywalker so then what we can do is we can send them to an Innokin Skywalker t-shirt all right so cool they clicked it yes or let's imagine we said do you prefer Anakin Skywalker Darth Vader they say all right no I prefer Darth Vader boom we sent to the Darth Vader funnel we can literally do the same exact thing right here how much more money will we make from our single shirt sale insane amounts literally insane amounts it's bonkers how much more money won't make well how much money art so let's say right here this is initial Luke Skywalker t-shirt was 15 dollars they come through right here another 15 dollars to come through right here it's a hoodie now $25 then they go right here and they go when they select their favorite character then they get their favorite character an email select sent straight to them boom another $10 that one $15 sale just turned into like another $50 in sales that is 5x seeing the business and what we can then do is we can come in and say all right cool what are we gonna do look how can we go and actually see how much money these leads are making us now and so we can go in and say all right cool so since we put these improvements in let's see exactly actually dude in six months right here and I can go alright cool so this is exactly who I contract improvements so after 12 weeks on average the people that came in and bought the shirt are actually worth fifteen dollars to me now not just the five dollars that we originally did that changes everything now there's so many more other things we can do here we can automate based on tags there's the banning cart emails and stuff event I'll show you how easy it is to connect here in a second but the last thing I want to show you so finally here's the last thing you do the third lesson that you can use to literally triple your store insulin and I'll show you exactly how to connect all of this is so simple so look right here you can see there's a checkout this is just a demo checkout page right here and you can see this little send the messenger button and if you actually talk a face we can get it auto approved are you doing this on your store and if you are how are you automating it because I want to show you something very cool see look here's one literally from my merch store saying look when someone comes to checkout a hoodie it boom it sends them this message directly in facebook Messenger you see that you see how that works but here's the even cooler thing I can automate this based on what they do okay so check this out so someone I get the typical abandoned cart message what I can do is easily automate the Facebook automations as well just like I've showed you before so I'm going to set my Facebook page right here so what I can do is I can come down right here and I can do sort by tag and so what's gonna happen is if they haven't bought yet it's gonna let me know if they have bought yet it's gonna let me know if they haven't bought yet I'm gonna some a Facebook message right here I'm easily gonna drag this down and this is just gonna say hey are you sure this is expiring right now and if they do buy it what I can easily do is send them a message for another product right here so boom I can go and just double my sales and do a my abandoned carts via market hero via our Shopify integration via facebook Messenger that's so easy and by the way if there's another app on the market that does this it's $99 a month which is really expensive just to get your abandoned cards it doesn't do any of this and we can't even go on broadcast to them so I can literally go out here to my broadcast and I can send a facebook messenger broadcast all these people now warning you don't want to do this over 24 hours you want to send maybe to like a video or something instead teaching them something and selling it the end of the video that's the only thing Facebook will allow but just like that pal I can go and add that and then finally what I want to show you is just how simple this is to integrate again I kind of apologize cuz look this probably seems like a big old infomercial on market here but these three things I just showed you will triple your business if you go and calculate your LTV and run your ads based on that if you go and add upsells and down sells and automated funnels based on your customers behavior you will make more money and if you go and do your abandoned carts via facebook Messenger using our simple integration and then automate that based on what they do and send the broadcast you're going to increase your money more if each of those increases your business by 30% only which LTV alone could triple it you've gone and doubled your business which is the goal of this video and going and adding your store to market here oh it takes a literal seconds and you will have all the data I just talked about at your fingertips in seconds so look I'm gonna go right here I'm gonna grab my Shopify store so I'm gonna go copy and paste my store in there pal I'm not login alright cool so you can see my store has been configured is plugged in and so it's as simple as this so we're gonna turn on automatic tagging this is going to import all the customers in the market here oh great alright so all of them are been order to import it in so it's gonna automatically go and tag customers when they purchase it's gonna go in and sign them a tag when they purchase based on the product name so all that's done for us now it's also going to assign a value to them so we can track the LTV of the customer instantly now what I'm do is going to enable category integration then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit category synchronization so this is gonna sort things by category so I can do shirts mugs whatever and import all of our previous prog so this will take in my entire sales history so I can start looking at my customers right away now I'm gonna set this tag so I can easily see everybody that's come to my store so I'm just gonna do in this example right here let's just do a hero merch okay I'm gonna set that text anybody that comes through the store is gonna be tagged by that so I can easily look at my emails and everything like that I can select the template that I want sent to them for abandoned carts so I'm just guard here hit templates let's just use this one right here just a random email for right now hit next step and then boom import my previous customers pal import previous orders pal and done see how simple that was so then I can come over here to leads and I can easily see everybody that's buying for my store and I can see all right how much these people worth to me I'm gonna go right here and I'm hit generate LTV cool so on average these people were $23 to me a lifetime value so if I'm going out there and I'm getting a $10 sale and a $10 t-shirt boom I'm still making money right there and I can go right here over to finance I can look at the total sales in the entire store I'd look at the total sales that we got going on let's just do I don't know last year and boom I can see the exact sales so we can actually look at the sales that were going on right here from this one little mini storm we don't really do too much with the store so you can see the sales now I can also go over here and I can generate the LTV how much of these people worth to me long term so look at this right here I can see pal these people come back and actually send an extra 50 on average we'll come back and spend on average an extra 20 something extra bucks with me look this this is the one-month LTV right there I can get all this data within seconds of connecting to my store so sorry if this seemed like an infomercial for market here but there's literally there's no other way to do what I
