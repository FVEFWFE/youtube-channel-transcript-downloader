TITLE: I Make $150K/Month From 20 Apps
VIDEO ID: 9sJ2R0rM3CA
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sJ2R0rM3CA
================================================================================

We've built 20 different apps over the past 10 years. &gt;&gt; Meet Katie. Over the past few years, she's built a portfolio of 19 apps that collectively make $1.8 million a year. &gt;&gt; All our software products compound on each other. &gt;&gt; What she's done is really impressive. One platform, 19 apps, tens of thousands of paying customers. [music] &gt;&gt; I'd recommend anyone to diversify their portfolio of apps. Most founders bet everything on one product, but Katie did the exact opposite. So, I called her up to learn more about how she built and grew all these software products. And in this episode, we will dive into the list of 19 different apps that she built, what most people get wrong about the whole portfolio of software approach, and if you're trying to do the same thing, exactly how to find the right first app idea to start your [music] portfolio. All right, guys, let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. Okay, real quick before we dive in. One reason Katie is successful is because she finds ideas, builds them, and ships them fast. [music] 19 successful apps in a few years is pretty amazing if you think about it. And I think this shipping muscle is one of the number one skills that separates successful people from everyone [music] else. So, after watching this episode and getting inspired, if you feel like you're ready to build your idea, just click the link in the description to get started on your first app. But for now, I want you to enjoy this one. So, get in. All right, guys. Let's get into the episode. Welcome, Katie, to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; My name is Katie Keith, and I built a remote team that created 20 apps that turn over $1.8 million a year. So today I'm excited to share more about my journey, how I grew the company, and also how we balance having so many [music] products. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, 20 apps. You run 20 different apps. That's crazy. Can you explain how this even works? How do you run 20 apps? What kind of apps are these? And if you could pull up some of your revenue dashboards and show us would be awesome. &gt;&gt; Uh 19 of our products are WordPress plugins. And the final one is our new Shopify app. Our plugins are fairly simple, which is how we can have [music] so many. We've got one called document library pro um which lets you add any kind of document library and we've got lots for Woo Commerce. They [music] let you add product tables, product options, protect areas of your store. They're typically, I would say, small to medium apps that let you add specific functionality [music] to your WordPress website or Woo Commerce store. So, we have a choice of plans. We've got one site, five sites, or 20 [music] where you either have an annual subscription or lifetime. This is our 2025 revenue. You can see it's just over $1.7 million. Uh I know I said 1.8 million earlier. That's because we have other revenue streams such as affiliate income and we offer some development services. In terms of stats, our average monthly revenue is about $150,000 across all of our plugins. It's higher than that in busy months like November and lower in quiet months like December. Over the entire lifetime of the business, we've sold $9.8 million worth of WordPress plugins. Overall, we think that our plugins are used on over 90,000 sites. That's the premium plugins. And also, [music] we have free versions of some of our plugins. So, that is the total number. For paying customers, we have 17,000 on an active subscription. We do have more paying customers than that because that doesn't include people who bought a lifetime deal which is about 15% of our revenue. &gt;&gt; We are going to talk about that a little bit more. I'm excited to talk about how you grew these apps and I'm sure you're going to have a lot of cool stuff to share there. But before we do, let's talk about ideas. Before you had 19 different ideas, how did you find the first plug-in idea to start? How did you find WordPress as this opportunity? How did this whole thing get started? How did you find the idea? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the thing. We never had 19 ideas. We did not sit down and think, let's build 19 WordPress plugins and then launch a Shopify app. It happened much more organic than that. Our first plug-in idea actually came from online research. There used to be a website called the Woo Commerce ideas forum and we chose an idea that lots of people were voting for. So, we built our first plug-in, Woo Commerce protected categories. [music] That's dead simple. It just lets you protect access to categories in your online store. And then our second plug-in was Post Table Pro, which lists any type of content from a WordPress site in [music] a searchable table. And we got that idea from a client project. We kept adding features and released it as a [music] premium plug-in. So once we'd got those plugins out there, customers started sending us requests [music] for new features in that plug-in. And sometimes it was best to achieve that not through a feature, [music] but a completely different plug-in. So, I would say get a product out there and then keep your ears open to get those ideas from your users because that's when you have that information coming into [music] you without even needing to ask for it. And if you're smart and you think creatively, that can lead to more ideas. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's switch topics a little bit to growth. You have 20 different plugins uh that are all serving different types of use cases and 20 different software businesses. That's a lot. For someone that has this sort of portfolio of startups, it's definitely a different way of approaching growth. Can you explain what the biggest needle mover was when it comes to growth? Where do most of your customers come from? &gt;&gt; Most of our customers have always come from organic search. When we first launched our initial plug-in, which was Woo Commerce protected categories, [music] it was the only plug-in that did that. That's why we built it because we found on a forum that there was a gap in the market. So, uh, as a marketer, I started publishing blog posts and tutorials about how to password protect categories in Woo Commerce. And because it was unique, we got to the top of Google straight away, and we got our first sales within a few [music] days. Now, I know it's not that easy to find a unique idea, particularly 10 years later, but that's what we did. And we've always been very good at producing genuinely helpful, unique content about a wide range of use cases relating to our plugins. &gt;&gt; Katie's story is incredible. $1.8 million a year from 19 different plugins. But here's what starts to happen when you're running a business at that kind of scale. You start landing bigger customers, start processing their data, and suddenly they're asking about compliance. Sock 2, ISO 2701. These compliance requirements can become blockers to closing enterprise deals, especially when all you want to do as a founder is ship products and sell them. Well, that's where Delve comes in, the sponsor for today's episode. Delve is an AI native compliance platform built for fast growing startups. Their AI agents handle the repetitive work like monitoring your tech stack and autofilling security questionnaires so you can stay focused on building and shipping. And unlike traditional compliance tools, Delve isn't just software. You get support in Slack with responses from their team in about five minutes when you need help. You'll get penetration testing and the audit all in one simple package. Thousands of fast growing [music] companies trust Delve to get compliant quickly without slowing down. For starter story listeners, Delve is offering an exclusive $1,500 discount on any compliance framework. So, if you're ready to get compliant without the headache, check out Delve at the link in the description or go to delve.co/starterstory. Thank you to Dell for sponsoring today's video. Let's get back to the story. Okay, cool. So, number one source of traffic. That's cool. You do run 20 different products though. I'm curious if there's any strategy there in terms of having all these different products. How does this help you grow? &gt;&gt; It's really helpful having so many products, especially ones that are very closely related because it means that we can cross-promote them and get multiple sales [music] from the same customer. And there are many ways that I would recommend doing that. We've got one plug-in and two plug-in bundles. And this is a key part of how we benefit from [music] having so many products. For each of our products, we have selected a closely related plug-in that we try to upsell with it. We then do additional uh tasks such as [music] after 3 days following the purchase, we send an email offering them 50% [music] off their next plug-in. On Black Friday, we have separate email campaigns [music] for potential customers and existing customers. And for the existing customers, we will use language like discount off your next [music] plug-in. And I think the trick there is to target the customers and segment your list so that you are recommending very closely [music] related products to the one that they're already using and that maximizes the likelihood that they're going to buy. And then you can keep sending the message home. things like banners on your settings pages [music] and constantly reminding them you have these complimentary products which are directly relevant to the one you're already using. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well, I think what you're doing at Barn 2 is awesome. This idea of having like a portfolio of software products I think was a lot harder maybe even 10 years ago to sort of have all these apps. But now in the age of AI where you can make you can build stuff more easily. You don't have to have as big of an engineering team to do this sort of thing. Uh, and then you have all these opportunities of cross-selling where you build something else and it's useful for the same customer. There's a lot of advantages to having this portfolio of software products. If you watch our channel, you'll see we've interviewed a bunch of people that have sometimes five, sometimes 10, sometimes [music] 20 like you. So, I'm curious, if you were to start over today, obviously you started this business a long time ago. You've built up all this customer equity and all this stuff. What would be your playbook to building multiple apps or plugins if you were to start over today in 2026? If I was starting over today, here's my playbook as to how I would approach building a software company with multiple [music] products. For step one, I would focus on an area I'm already familiar with. If I'm building WordPress websites for clients, then I would look [music] at creating WordPress products. Think about where your experience is because that's where you have unique insights into [music] the gaps and what the user is looking for. For step two, I would come up with several product ideas at the same time. That means start with a long list, research and validate every idea and choose a handful of ideas that have the most potential [music] and then prioritize the ideas that have overlapping market so that you get that cross promotion opportunity. Step three would be to start by building the product that has the most potential in terms of having the largest audience where you think you can carve out some market share for yourself marketing wise and use that as your starting point. Build that and launch it as your only product. Don't build multiple products and launch them [music] all at once because every time you build a product, you need to give it a decent amount of time to do the marketing and grow it without distractions and also [music] to listen to your early users and continue improving that product. Don't spread yourself too thin by launching five at once. And then step four is that when you are ready to launch your second product, market it as a standalone product and develop advanced crossromotion tactics. That might include linking between them on your website, emailing users of your existing [music] product about the new one with discounts, asking if they want to beta test, adding pages about the other product to your documentation. Also, things like post-purchase emails are [music] useful. And then step five is repeat the above process until you have a decent portfolio of products, each [music] of which generate revenue, but that you haven't spread yourself so thin that you can't do any of them justice. &gt;&gt; Well, thanks for sharing that. I love the multiple product strategy, and the more I see people like you successful with it, the more I realize how many people are also successful. We did this awesome interview with someone uh called John Rush who has a similar strategy and he's cross-selling everything across uh each product and I think it's something that clearly has worked for you and it's going to continue to get even bigger. So, anybody who's watching this, I think there's a lot to learn from this. I want to switch topics a little bit, Katie, and ask you about how you run your business. What's the tech stack? What tools and software and stack and coding languages do you use to run this business that makes nearly $2 million a year? Yeah, we combine various tools to run the business. We are leaning very heavily on ClickUp these days. We use it for project management, time [music] tracking, company chat. We use GitHub, which is free to store the source code repositories for all of our products. We use Zapia a lot for automations. [music] We use WordPress obviously for our company website. And we also use lots of WordPress plugins, but in particular, Easy Digital Downloads, which [music] is the e-commerce software that we use to sell our plugins and sort out all the licensing and the download delivery and so on, which cost us [music] about $300 a year. &gt;&gt; Cool. Well, thanks for sharing that. One last question that we ask everyone who comes on the channel, Katie, if you could go back in time before you has started the first plugin, before you has started your business, what would be your advice to you young Katie starting out or to anyone watching this who wants to build useful software on the internet? Maybe it's plugins, maybe it's SAS. What would be your advice? &gt;&gt; My advice would be to just do it, which means get to work and launch a product because once you get something out into the world, then opportunities start coming your way. Even if your first product isn't a success, you'll learn a huge amount from the experience and you'll hopefully receive feedback and feature requests which can lead to other successful products in the [music] future. Whereas, if you do nothing, then nothing will happen for you. &gt;&gt; Well, that's great advice. Thanks, Katie, for coming on. Super cool business you built. Uh you can check out all the different plugins they built on their website. Super cool niche stuff. You might get some ideas. Uh thanks for coming on and sharing and uh yeah, inspiring. Thanks for having me. &gt;&gt; Okay, Gus, starter story producer. What do you think about this one? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I really like the multi-product approach thing that she was talking about. Not putting all your eggs in one basket. It feels like just a smart thing to do. I don't know. That's kind those are my initial impressions, but yeah. What do you think? &gt;&gt; Yeah, the uh there's something in the changing of the times where before you would be crazy to have multiple products. Why? because building multiple products meant multiple engineering teams t typically when it came to software. So that when there's a bug in one software if if you're having a bug a day in your software then you have 19 softwares and you have 19 bugs a day and then your life is a living hell. But with AI you don't really need engineering teams to build stuff now. Actually software is becoming commoditized and you can spin up an app in one day and the audience and the customer is what's valuable. what she said and I will just reiterate it again is that when she didn't do it the right way she built random apps for different customers &gt;&gt; when she was doing it the right way in terms of the multi-product strategy she was building different apps for the same customer but selling it as a separate instead of adding it as a feature to this big monolith app and then cross-selling it which is actually better for the customer because they don't need everything and it can be confusing with plugins you can have all 19 installed and it just works. &gt;&gt; Yeah, totally. And yeah, you mentioned this during the interview, but we interviewed like John Rush a while back. That was a really good interview, but similar thing where he's building kind of all these different tools that like layer on each other. And that's just like a smart approach, you know, for someone like me. I always kind of have the beginner mindset, you know, like how can I just get one out the door, but like kind of thinking about like, oh, if I get one project out the door, how can I build like something on top of it? Like it also reminds me of that guy he did the interview on the like he's on the treadmill I forget his name he did all the like his was mobile apps but they were all health apps related you know to each other and he did similar [music] like cross promotion so I don't know it's kind of interesting strategy I don't know yeah &gt;&gt; yeah I think the one thing to take away is you know we can get excited about the five different 20 different apps that you're going to build but her biggest takeaway was find an idea something that you know a little bit about and then build that first thing she didn't say build five things in a She [music] said, "Build the first thing and then ideas will come to you like water." So, for anyone watching this that wants to build their first thing, [music] you know what I'm going to say. Starter story builds. Click the link in the description. We will help you find a good idea, build it, and get it in the hands of real customers within a couple days. If you want to do your first idea, I would click that link in the description. You can get started right now. All right. Thank you guys for watching. Hope you enjoyed this one. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: How I Built a $12K/Month SaaS (Reddit and SEO Playbook)
VIDEO ID: R4BS_UiTBPw
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4BS_UiTBPw
================================================================================

Every SAS founder should grow their app like this. &gt;&gt; This is Aayush, a guy from India who built an app that makes over $150,000 a year and he grew it using one formula, the Reddit and SEO playbook. &gt;&gt; If I was starting over, I would run this playbook again. &gt;&gt; Ah started on Reddit. Then he moved to SEO and within a few months his app went from no users to thousands. &gt;&gt; Reddit worked first but then we scaled with SEO. &gt;&gt; I was curious on how he actually did this. So, I asked Aush to come on to the channel and break down his entire playbook. And in this video, we'll dive into his exact Reddit strategy that helped him make his first 10K, the SEO playbook that scaled him to his next 100K, and why he believes this playbook still works in 2026. This one is going to be fun. Let's dive into it. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. All right, real quick before we get into the interview, you're about to get two playbooks for growing a SAS, Reddit and SEO. This is a really awesome story and if you really liked it, I have something even more for you. Later in this video, I'll be sharing a deeper playbook on how to get your first 100 users [music] from Reddit. I'll be talking about that a little bit later, but click the first link in the description if you want it now. [music] All right, let's get into the interview. All right, Aush, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; Hey, my name is Aayush. I'm the co-founder of LFS. Uh, it's a simple AI Mac app that has gone from 0 to 150K RR over the last 3 years. We grew it to 150K per year through Reddit and SEO and that's what I'm excited to talk to you about today. &gt;&gt; Okay, before we get into all that and how you grew this app, I just want to understand, can you explain what this app does? What's the business model? What did you build? &gt;&gt; So, yeah. So, so LFS is a Mac AI assistant. It's a place where you can, you know, index all of your local files like PDFs, Apple notes, all sorts of local knowledge that you have. Uh, and you can create your own superb brain or knowledge bases out of them and then chat with them and then create content and reports and then and basically use for your work. We have three standard plans. Uh we sell subscriptions monthly, annual, and then we also sell lifetime deals. When you're doing uh downloadable apps, especially Mac apps, the customers expect a lifetime deal. Expect like a onetime payment thing. It it's it's a mindset uh that they have. So, we've stuck with lifetime deal since the beginning. We've gradually raised prices. &gt;&gt; I'd love if you could show me just some of your dashboards. I just want to see like where where's this revenue coming from? Could you pull up some of your Gumroad dashboard setup dashboard and kind of show us some of this? &gt;&gt; So, we have four revenue channels. uh own website, set app bundle, a Mac app store and the iOS app store. We use Gumroad for uh for selling licenses. This is uh this year's data around 110K from here. Uh we're also on set app. So yeah, this is over last couple of years we've that we've been on set app. Uh we've done some revenue there. I can pull up the Mac app store around 12,000. Uh there this is our uh website traffic. This is a plausible dashboard. We're getting around 180k visits uh per year. &gt;&gt; I want to understand how do you even get into this? What's your background? How do you learn about making money online and building apps? Can you go a little bit into that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so my actually my business partner Cumber was the one who started Elephant22 and he hired me as a consultant. Uh right at the time I had just quit my job of uh my corporate job of 11 years. Uh I was part-time consulting with some early say startups helping them with product and marketing. So that's when I started working on LFS. got some good results uh in the first five or 6 months and eventually we reached the stage where he invited me to join him as the co-founder and as the marketing guy uh and then he asked me to go all in on LFS and then he he is the of course the development guy the coder person and I became the marketing person and since then we've grown uh grown the product as as a 2% team. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. So you're the marketing guy. I love it. That's why I wanted to bring you on to the channel to really talk about this really cool way of thinking about marketing your product which is Reddit and then SEO. So before we get into all that, I'd just like to understand a highlevel overview of how you took Elephas from zero to over $10,000 a month. What was this playbook? &gt;&gt; So the playbook that really worked for us was the Reddit and then SEO playbook. So Reddit, Reddit is essentially a gold mine of high intent niche audiences. It's a great place to get feedback initially when you're starting out also great place to get traffic and eventually conversions. In the early days, we posted a lot on niche subreddits asking for feedback, showcasing the product, giving demos, which led to initial initial revenue customers. those customers, feedback from those customers, insights from them eventually ended up shaping the product over time. We essentially use Reddit to go from 0 to $3,000 in MR within a within a period of 6 months. So So Reddit is great in initially, right? But but eventually Reddit stops working or there are like diminishing returns to investing more more of your time or effort in in in Reddit. So SEO is is like the best organic marketing channel out there, especially if you're bootstrapping uh like like us, right? This was back in 2023. Uh ChatG was just launched. Google was still the primary way people searched for information. Right? We start actually started getting some organic traffic on one of our help articles. Uh right, we we wrote support articles for our initial customers uh to help them out with using the product and those articles started getting traction from Google. Uh we accidentally discovered like SEO as a as a channel that that we could go go in and over 12 month period of 2023 we ended up making around $70,000 from purely from Google only. So uh SEO essentially uh you know took us from 3K to where we are now. we are at around 12K per month that we're doing. So, uh I think all of it work perfectly in harmony because when you're starting out, you need feedback, you need traction, you need niche audiences and you need fast feedback. Reddit is very good for that. But eventually you want uh you know a sustainable scalable way of getting high intent traffic uh and for which you don't have uh if you're bootstrapping you don't have a lot of ad dollars to spend then SEO is the best way to go forward. &gt;&gt; Building is getting easier and easier thanks to AI. So now I have a lot of people DMing me and asking me, Pat, I can build stuff, but how the heck do I grow and how the hell do I get users and distribution? So I decided to put something together for free that will help you with that. We've put together a guide on how to get your first 100 users on Reddit as I've talked to dozens of founders who have used Reddit to grow their business, and this is the stuff that actually works. [music] This is a part of Starter Story Mo, which is our complete framework for finding your distribution channel in 2026. So, if you want to use Reddit to grow your product, then head to the first link in the description to grab it and check it out for free. All right, let's get back to the interview. Okay, so the Reddit then SEO playbook. I love this. It reminds me of what I did when I started Starter Story, which is just go out on Reddit to get early feedback, early traction, and then kind of building SEO behind the scenes because it takes a little bit longer. I want to dive a little bit into the Reddit piece because I think a lot of people watching this might be wondering, how can I get my first users from Reddit? I'd love if you could dive if possible into an example of a Reddit post that kind of crushed it for you and drove customers to your product. Could you do that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so this is like an example post uh right that did well for us. You know, the focus of the post is a video demo of the product, but you also want to wrap it around in a in a use case or a problem solution kind of a framing or a story kind of a framing, right? So, so something like me or my friend was facing this problem. So, I built this feature to solve it. See, this is how it works. Uh if you want to try, you can try it for 30 days for free. I'm just looking for feedback. You know, if if I should improve this feature in any way, please give your inputs. I think this works because this is not blatant uh self-promotion. You're explaining the b reasoning behind the feature that you've built. Uh Reddit is a very smart audience. They hate marketers. They hate being sold to, but they do appreciate uh if you can explain the logic uh uh to them and and talk to them like adults. Something like, "Hey, I built this. This is why I built it. What do you think? Can I improve anything here?" And and in general, I think video demos do well like show don't tell marketing. like don't go out there and say how good your product is. Just show it to people what what it can do, right? So for this post, we had just launched the super brain feature at the time and we had no idea whether this is something even useful. Are people even interested in and this got us a lot of positive feedback and a lot of feature requests which eventually became our main primary uh feature which is like a super brain feature that that we have that thousands of people use today to index their documents and and and chat with them and create content with them. after a while mod started uh you know cracking down on them and removing them but good thing is that we do still get some traffic from from these posts but a lot of the engagement is is now gone and yeah it is how how you see it is &gt;&gt; and that's the thing that I always hear about from people that want to figure out Reddit they'll post on Reddit and then you know the moderation rules are strict that's part of the game right could you walk me through the exact playbook if you had to start over today to kind of replicate what you did &gt;&gt; so yeah so if I was starting out first I'll make a list of all the subreedits where my ICP is hanging out every Okay, at least 15 subreddits. Use something like the map of Reddit uh which is essentially like a free open source project. It's there on GitHub. You can uh you know enter yours one subreddit and you get to see essentially the map of Reddit. And here you can get a lot of ideas and a lot of new niche subreddits that you can go and where your potential ICP might be hanging out. Any subreddit that is greater than 5,000 members is okay. You don't have to go after really big subreddits. Actually, smaller subreddits are sometimes better uh because there are niche audiences, simpler rules, the mods are more forgiving. uh in fact the mods want more content on the subreddit themselves. So that is step one. Uh make a list of uh of all the subreddits and then pick one feature or pain point that your product is solving. Right? So that is step two. Make a short video demo about it. Explain why you built it in as simple terms as possible. Share this in a subreddit and at the bottom add a link to your product. Say you know try it out for free for 30 days. We added UTM links to all the links that we posting in uh in subreddits to exactly you know which feature we are talking about. uh what date it is, what subreddit it is. So you post this on one subreddit, you analyze uh it it its performance. And step three is basically uh tweaking the copy a bit and then and then repeating the same post on on another subreddit. Every day you're posting on at least one subreddit. Never post on all subreddits in one day. People can see that because there will be a lot of overlapping audiences. So one a day on one subreddit is is is good enough. &gt;&gt; I love that playbook, especially doing it every day for 14 15 days. Not only will it prevent people from thinking you're spamming, but also maybe you make a little tweak to the copy, maybe you improve it. One thing that I want to hear from you is kind of the negativity around Reddit. I hear this a lot. People I shared my thing and you know there were mean comments. The mod banned me. These really bad things happen. Was that your experience that you got hate from some of your posts or was that not? And how did you handle it if so? &gt;&gt; Yes, we we got hate but that's okay. I think you you will get hate. You will get banned and it's okay. like maybe like you can create like multiple accounts if if one of your accounts gets banned and you can have backups and burner accounts but eventually learn to deal with negativity like this is business we're doing here develop a thick skin I would say &gt;&gt; okay and then the other question that I have is what defines success on Reddit like when you see a post how many up votes how much engagement are you looking to go viral or what was a successful post or marketing on Reddit look like &gt;&gt; so so there's there's no benchmark like we've had posts that have like zero upwards standard post would get 30 40 50 upwards we had gone viral with 300 400 upwards as well. But you are looking at traffic and conversions. But I think what Reddit really gives you is the qualitative data that comes from all the comments and the engagement that you get and then how people are responding. What is the mood? What is the vibe that you're getting about the product, right? Especially when the product is very new, you really want to know what real authentic people think about you and and that is something that only Reddit can give you. No, like no other platform can give you like raw honest thoughts from people the way Reddit can can get you. And just for that, I think Reddit is worth it. At least posting on Reddit is worth it. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. So, the Reddit part is amazing. I love Reddit and thanks for sharing all that. Let's jump to the next part of the playbook, which is SEO. And SEO is kind of a buzzword. What did SEO mean for you and what did that look like especially in the early days? &gt;&gt; I think we happened to accidentally discover SEO. We we were just, you know, we were getting initial customers. We were just uh writing helpful articles, support articles based on the questions that customers were getting, right? So we wrote we wrote like an article on you know how to create OpenAI API keys. Uh right this is a very simple article just has bunch of screenshots some links you know do this do this do this. We didn't realize we we ranked for this word number one on Google for 6 to 8 months. We were getting a lot of traffic for it and we accidentally realized oh Google is actually a genuine inbound traffic channel. Of course like this was not a very high intent audience from these kind of articles. But we got a lot of traffic and we got a lot of insights on what are the future topics that we could write about to get more high intent audiences. Uh and then that's when we discovered that oh we can actually go and do keyword research and then find new keywords to write uh more articles on and then start getting uh organic traffic in. &gt;&gt; So you kind of created this article even though it doesn't it really has to do with creating API keys which doesn't have much to do with elevate. It was sort of an accident when you created this, but then I'm guessing you saw that and you're like, "Wo, this is getting a lot of traffic. Let's do this for more articles that have more a little bit more product intent, right? So, you get signups. Is that right? Could you show me maybe one of those articles that you know really drives customer signups?" &gt;&gt; So, yeah. So, so what we did is we went back, we did more keyword research. We figured out that there are like underserved niches or underserved queries on Google which have low competition but high demand. Like this is an example of an article we wrote 18 best chat GPT Mac apps free and paid. Essentially it is a listical where we are highlighting all the best apps that were being built at the time around chat GPT and yeah we were number one uh there and we got a lot of high intent traffic and and conversions uh from from this article itself. We are getting a lot of AI traffic uh as well from here chat GPT claity all the AI answer engines basically are are referencing a lot of our articles and that audience is even more high intent because they've already made up their minds about buying so they're coming in and and directly buying uh very quickly. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well, thanks for sharing that. I want to dive a little deeper into the SEO thing because again, yeah, it is kind of a buzz word. There's a lot of different approaches to SEO. So, I'd love to hear from you, someone who's actually implemented it and actually been very successful with it uh as a, you know, small bootstrap business. What would be your playbook if you had to start over with SEO today? What would be the steps that you would take right now to kind of crush it with SEO? &gt;&gt; I think the very first thing know your exact positioning in the market like where do you lie? Uh, right. Uh, how does the customer look at the market and where do you fit in? Like for us that was like chat GPT Mac apps uh right so there are a bunch of chat GPT apps there a smaller market was of chat GPT Mac apps and within those there were like a small niche of products that that people could could buy. So know your positioning. Uh right once you know that then it becomes easier to do keyword research because now you're thinking as the customer and and you're you're trying to imagine what would your ICP would you know search on Google or what would they type into chat GPT or you can use something like AHFS to get more data and figure out the keywords that your customer is searching for and also the keywords that your competition is already ranking for. So what I really love is inside AHFS like have a filter. You know, anything with a keyword difficulty of less than 20 and a search volume of greater than 500 is is like a very good combination of of parameters. Especially if you are like a new website uh you don't have a lot lot of domain authority. Then you should not go after a lot of high volume keywords and high competition keywords. You should try and focus on a low volume, high intent uh and low competition keywords. Uh this is what I used to do. Uh I used to buy HS. It was $129. was a lot of money for us. Use the 500 credits to do keyword research. Make a list of keywords around 30 to 50 topics and then go back and write out those blog posts. If you're starting out, you can just start with like two or three blog posts a week and eventually you can, you know, scale up to six or seven. Even the actual writing itself, you can use a lot of AI tools, but it is better to use AI in SEO for as more as a research assistant. What you want to figure out with AI is that what sort of content is already working well and make like a scaffold or or an outline or a structure of that kind of article and then add your own spin to it. Add your own flavor and your own style or tone to humanize it more. As long as you can add net new information to the internet, you will win with SEO. I think that is like a good frame to look at SEO is how can you bring your personal insights, your user data, uh right, your market intelligence that you have and you're adding new information to the internet. you're not just regurgitating what what uh the internet already has. Uh I think as long as you can do that, you will win win win with SEO. that SEO playbook. Want to switch topics a second and go over the actual app that you built. We didn't really go over it in depth. Would you be able to show me a quick demo of Elephos and how it works? &gt;&gt; Essentially, it's like a knowledgebased app uh where if you have a lot of documents, a lot of files locally on your computer, you can create your own personal GPTs out of them. We also have like an offline version. So it's like 100 you can turn off the Wi-Fi download offline open source models and then use those for using but I'll just give like a brief demo. I created like a brain uh we call them super brains essentially knowledge bases. Uh you can add all sorts of files and folders. I've just added like one file here which is like the deep work. I like to refer to it often. Basically uh you know you can ask it something like what is deep work according to Cal Newport. The value is that it will go through only the documents that are already existing on your file or the the documents that you have added here in this particular brain uh and come up with an answer based on just that. So that way it's not hallucinating like it's basically AI grounding but essentially people love it because they get answers that they can trust on then they know that something like chatg or claude might hallucinate or come up with new content but always comes with answers from your own data and you can add all types of integrations files YouTube videos web pages uh uh we even have an Apple notes integration so we have a lot of people who use Apple notes as a second brain uh and they would just you know hook it up with LFS and then just get to you know chat with it uh and and and and then use it to uh to to understand their own notes and then use it for their work. &gt;&gt; Thanks for showing that. That that's awesome. Looks like a super cool app. How did you build it? Could you walk through your tech stack? How much you spend on different tools and languages and hosting and those sorts of things and and walk through all that. &gt;&gt; I think Cloud Code is is probably the number one tool AI tool that everyone should be using right now. It does so much for just $100 a month. We use it both for development as well as for marketing. Uh LFS is a native Mac app, so it's built with Swift. For marketing, we use AHFS. It's one of our top tools. Uh it's 129 a month, but it's so worth it because you get so much data from it. If you can't afford it, just get it for a month and and you know, do keyword research for a quarter or 4 months. Uh and then yeah, we use Neuron Writer to to do pre-publish checks on our blog posts. Uh right, it it it's like a tool where you can enter a blog post and see how it compares before publishing. Uh right, so that that's very useful. We use the map of Reddit to research Reddit and and find new subreddits to to go after. Use Nitn. If someone mentions uh LFS on Reddit or on other social uh platforms, we know and we can we can go and comment and reply there. We use ClickUp inside uh the team to manage all all our work. We use Discord for the team communication as as well as we have a very thriving community of our users. Uh right. So that community lives on our discord channel and we get feedback and feature requests every day there. We use superb block for hosting mailorite for email marketing. Uh plausible for website analytics and uh of course Google search console is free tool from Google for for SEO. &gt;&gt; Last question that we ask everyone who comes on the channel if you could stand on young Aush's shoulders before you started this before you quit your job. Uh what would be your advice anyone watching this who wants to build stuff like you? &gt;&gt; Put more buy buttons on the internet. Right. I think lots of people build something in silence for 6 months, have a wait list on a free sign up uh right and they they think that you know automatically you know build it and they'll come and nobody buys. I think people are too afraid to charge too afraid to put up a real buy button. But the the learning and growth that can happen from a buy button is unlike anything else. You'll not learn from a marketing book or a course or a sales book or a course, right? Because uh when you publish uh something online, your product, your work uh that's when you learn like when people look at it, do they flinch at you? Uh do they ignore you or do they swipe their card and pay for you to what you've built to to get to that place? You have to fail a lot. Uh so both me and Ken, my business partner combined, we we have like 30 plus failed projects before this. My advice for anyone is, you know, get get that failure out of the way as soon as possible, right? put more buy buttons on the internet. Test a lot of ideas, short sprints, fail fast, learn fast. Uh see which few ideas are working, which are making getting most traction, which are getting most revenue. Uh and then double down on on the ones that work. &gt;&gt; Well, that's great advice. Thanks, Aush. That was super awesome. Reddit SEO playbook and all that was amazing. So, thanks for coming on and sharing everything. Uh if you enjoyed this, please put a comment down there below and Aish will maybe be able to answer some of your questions. Thanks for coming on. &gt;&gt; Happy to. Thanks a lot for having me, Pat. This is amazing. All right, Gus, our producer, what did you think of this one? What did you think of the interview? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I thought it was awesome. It was really fun to see the two different playbooks. My biggest takeaway is that this is a playbook that like still works today. And during the interview, you said like, "Oh, I used this to grow start story even, you know, long before what Aush was talking about." So, it was really cool to see like he only did it a few years ago and it's still something that anyone who built something can can try and do. And it's like it's almost free, right? That's probably another thing I was thinking about is like this is free. It's just effort to post on Reddit. It's just effort to write those blogs. &gt;&gt; I agree. And I think one thing that he mentioned, he didn't go too deep into it, which I think is really important. The qualitative data you get from Reddit. Posting on Reddit is not necessarily about how much traffic I got and how much revenue I got and how many paid customers signed up. It's about the engagement and the comments [music] and the feedback you get from real people. he mentioned this which is Reddit is one of the last places where there are less bots and people will be honest with you and they'll have long discussions. There's so many interviews that we've done with people that they'll show me that first Reddit post they did and it had like 50 up votes. It's not about this scalable strategy. Um and I think a lot of people go in thinking, "Okay, I'm going to make $10,000 from a Reddit post that I do." That's not what it's about. It's about getting feedback from users and talking to users and just getting a feel for is this product potentially something that could be validated and then taking that feedback and improving the product. We didn't talk a whole lot about that, but I really think that if you go into Reddit thinking that I'm going to have million dollars overnight, that's the wrong way of thinking. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a really good way of saying and I think as you know someone like me who's more in like the early stages of like building stuff and sharing online, it feels like kind of scary, right? To like put it out there. But at some point in the interview, he said like I think you asked him a question about that and he was just like basically you have to develop like thick skin, you know, when when you post on those kind of forums and like just know that you're going to get a little bit of hate, but in the long run he learned a lot from that and it helped him like you said. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, I'd recommend just is exactly what you said is if you sometimes question putting yourself out there, Reddit is a great somewhat anonymous place for you to go out there and experience what it like it's like for someone to be, you know, pessimistic about your product or say it sucks or whatever. Even if it doesn't work as a channel or anything, I'd recommend anybody watching this to just go and try it to experience what it's like to get negative feedback on something that you created. Even if nothing else happens, that's a really important step in being a founder and [music] building stuff. Okay, so that was a great interview. I think hopefully a lot of you guys liked it. If you are looking to build your app in 2026, whether it's an iOS app, a SAS, whatever it is, you should definitely check out Starter Story Build is our platform where within a couple weeks you will find an idea, you will build it with AI tools and you will launch a real product to the real world that is ready to take payments and make money. So check that out. I'll put the link in the description for that. Otherwise, thank you for watching and we'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: I Built a $20K/Month Mobile App: Here’s My Entire Playbook
VIDEO ID: yBjcmMhXSDk
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBjcmMhXSDk
================================================================================

I launched my app 6 months ago and now it makes over 20K a month. This is Matt, a regular guy who changed his life by building an app with AI. It took me 3 days to code the app with AI. But this is not a story about [music] how to build. It's a story about how fast apps can grow if you focus on the right things. I asked Ma to come on to the channel to break down exactly how he did all of this in just 6 months. And in this video, he breaks down exactly how he built a mobile app in 3 days with AI, the specific [music] marketing strategy that got him his first few hundred paying users, and the playbook that ultimately scaled him to over $20,000 a month. Guys, this is an episode that [music] you cannot skip. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. Real quick before we get into the interview, guys, now is about to break down what's actually working right now when it comes to building and growing an app in 2026. [music] and beyond. And if you're ready to build your app, I put a link in the description right there where you can get started [music] right now building your thing. I'll talk about that a little bit more later, but let's get into the interview. All right, Mal, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; My name is Mal Baron, and I built a Christian app that makes over 20K a month. In only 6 months, I've accumulated over 58K downloads, 6.7K reviews, and a 4.9 star rating on the App Store. All right, Mal, before we get it all into that, what you built and everything, first I'd love if you could share a little bit about your business model. Pull up some of your revenue and analytics so we can really see this thing. &gt;&gt; My app is called Prayer Lock. It basically just blocks your phone until you pray. When you try to open one of them, we ask you through questions and based on that, you get a dedicated AI generated prayer. You recite it and you're good to go. You can scroll away. It's a subscription based app. I charge $49.99 a year or $9.99 a week. And in terms of monthly revenue, we closed December at $21,000 in sales. A previous month was at $15K and October was at 10K. We've been growing at over 50% a [music] month. In total downloads, we have right now close to 58,000 downloads. We have a conversion rate of 43%. Our proceeds for paying user is $23.6. Our total proceeds have been 41,000. So, my app right now probably has one of the best onboarding rates in the world. Our review rate is over 12%. We have 6.7K ratings with less than 60K downloads. In November, Prayer Lock reached number 22 in the reference category. Okay, cool. Well, thanks for showing your dashboards so transparently, showing you all the numbers. That's amazing. We're going to get into all how you built this, grew this, and even a little bit of paid ads, which I'm excited about. But before, I know you started it this year, which is insane that it's grown this much. I'd love if you could give me a little bit of background on how you get here, how you decide to start building apps. How do you get to this point? &gt;&gt; I actually don't come from a tech background. I actually majored in finance, but I discovered the original Codex model back in 2022 when I saw that I just completely fell in love with AI and technology and I decided that's what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. So, I taught myself about AI, about how to code. I have been building tech and AI businesses ever since. Back in January of 2025, I was actually building an adult content AI app, but when I finished it, I just felt completely like disgusted and disappointed with myself. So, I decided to make the weirdest pivot in history and turn into the Christian space to try to reconnect with my faith. And after about 3 months of building apps nobody wanted, I came across this app called Praycreen that blocked your phone until you prayed. And with the new insights I had, I looked at the design, I looked at the features, the way they were executing their distribution, and I said, you know what, I can do a better job than them. And so that's how Prayer Law came to life. Well, &gt;&gt; that's awesome. I think what the most interesting thing there that I heard is that by doing this, you were able to get closer to your customers and truly understand them, which led to this massive success that you're now seeing. Now, I think there's a little secret there. I want to switch to topics a little bit and get into the building of this app. You did this yourself, right? So, how did you do that? I built Prayer Lock back in June. I literally just use cursor and chat GPT. Like that's it. With cursor, I mainly use Sonnet as my daily driver and then I use chat to ask questions and apply simple code changes with the Mac desktop app. And so yeah, it took me 3 days to code the app and over a week to actually get it approved on the app store. But honestly, it's never been easier to build an app than now. That's insane that you built it in basically 3 days. Obviously, there were previous apps before and you probably had tried and had starts and stops before, but once you found your idea that you really felt confident on, you're able to build it in basically 3 days. Do you have any tips for anyone watching here on how other people maybe they have a little bit experience, maybe no experience at all, how to build apps with AI in 2026? First of all, what I always say is do not design any mock-ups. Instead, study the best apps in your niche and study the best apps in other niches with tools like screens design and just go straight into coding. In my case, I actually created a Canva file where I laid out all of the best onboarding screens of the apps I liked and of my competitors and I literally just chose the best onboarding screens and apply that to my own app. Also, try to use different tools for different purposes. for example, like cursor as your daily driver, Codex CLI, which I love for more complex tasks, chat GBT for questions and easier problems. And the reason you want to do this, at least if you're in my position, I was broke. So, you don't want to be wasting hundreds or thousands of dollars on tokens. In doing this, you will diversify your token expenditure, right? Another thing is do not try to oneshot your apps. AI isn't there yet where you can just say like, "Hey, make me a mobile app. Make no mistakes. Don't hallucinate like that. That won't work at all." What AI is really good at doing is if you break down your app into blocks and then of course you can oneshot a feature here, you can oneshot a design or a screen here. Next thing is authentication honestly isn't even needed for modern apps. Like mine doesn't have authentication or a database and I'm printing money. The reason I made it this way is for two reasons. I wanted to reduce friction as much as possible. I don't want my users wasting time on signing up. And the other reason was to save costs. There's no reason to pay for a database when you can just save it all on device. And people might say, "Hey, like when I switch my phone, I'm going to lose my information." Nobody thinks about that. Like literally, that's that's a very like niche case. So Ma's story is incredible. He built and grew his app to $20,000 a month in just a few months. If you stick around to the end, you're going to get the full story on exactly how he did it. But before we get there, I do want you to think about the app that you've been meaning to build. You probably already know how to use these AI tools or tried them out. You followed tutorials and probably even built pieces of different things. But what usually stops people from actually launching isn't the building part. It's picking something that's actually worth finishing and then taking it all the way to real users that can give you real market feedback. Well, that's exactly what Starter Story Build is designed for. In just a few days, you will choose an idea that makes sense, build it end to end, and actually launch with structure, momentum, and other builders doing it alongside you. If you're tired of halffinish projects, well, the link is in the description if you want to get started right now. All right, let's get back to the interview. I'm going to switch topics now to the growth because everyone knows who's watching this. You'll read all the comments. They'll say, "Okay, you don't talk about the marketing enough. Building stuff is easy now, but as I understand, you were the builder and the marketer and the growth person. You did all this by yourself. What I want to understand is how did you actually grow this thing and get users?" In the beginning, I didn't know what worked. So, I literally just tried a bunch of different formats and I started posting around 40 times a day on 12 different accounts. Volume really matters here. What ended up working for me [music] was the classic, you know, GC girl reaction video with a demo on it. That's what one of my biggest competitors doing and they were just killing it with it. I was broke so I couldn't pay for clips. I couldn't pay for another creator. So, I just told my girlfriend at the time, now wife, to help me record some reactions herself and she honestly killed it. We started posting twice a day. It wasn't until after 40 posts that I finally found a hook that worked and I knew I just needed to spam that in both Tik Tok and Instagram. When you start seeing that a format starts to work, put all your energies into that. That alone with only that account, I was getting around 10k views a day, which was all I needed to get to my first 1K a month. With that, I immediately reached out to my friends and I wanted to scale this and I hired another UGC creators. It was honestly very hard to get her account. this other creator's account going on both Tik Tok and Insta. But after 14 days, we finally cracked one video which organically got around 20K views. Knowing how views convert to downloads is very tricky. In my case, 10K views a day was getting me around 2 to 300 downloads a day. But this is because this specific format is very optimized for downloads. With those two accounts, with my wife's account and this other girl creator, I was now doing 1.5K in July and 2.4K in August. What's cool about that, as you said, is that I think a lot of people think, okay, I got to be posting on Tik Tok and YouTube and X and personal brand, but no, you only need to really be on one platform. For you, it was Tik Tok or reals. And then you really only need one format that you just do lots and lots of videos over and over again. So, I think that's a great lesson there. Once you started getting organic to work, what was next? Cuz obviously you were doing like 1 2 3k a month, but now you're doing 20k. So, how do you get there? I hired an influencer. That flop didn't go well. But after that experience, I said, I want to try something else. The only other route was paid ads. When I tried them, I completely failed. I optimized for downloads instead of trials. I had a just a very bad onboarding. It was trash. I upgraded my onboarding from 5 minutes to 15 minutes. And generally the longer you're onboarding, as long as it's adding value and telling a story, the better. I immediately saw my organic conversion rate more than 3x organically without paid ads. With my new knowledge, I said, you know, let's try this again. I now have a better conversion rate. I started with Meta and I started spending $20 a day. This was giving me, you know, respectable decent results. $10 per trial started. Then I decided to try Tik Tok ads and honestly this changed everything. I created a super broad campaign without any audience controls, nothing. I only specified the location to US and inserted a bunch of my top UGC girl reaction videos from before. Started doing $20 a day only. And the results were way better. They were insane. I was getting $4 per trial started when my yearly subscription cost 50. And I said, you know what? Let's go all in. I'm going to throw all my savings into this around $4,000 into the ads. And that's [music] when I closed October at 10K only with these UGC reaction videos. Now with a little more budget scrolling on Tik Tok, I came across Matthew, this cracked 15-year-old UGC creator. And the minute I saw like the first 3 seconds of his video, I was like, I need to work with him. So I reached out and we started working together and he very quickly organically got us to consistent 10K views per video. I was thinking of him as only a JVC creator. But you know, one day I decided, you know what, maybe I should try Spark Ads on his videos as well. see how this does. The results were absolutely insane. With his videos, I started getting $3 per trial started and I realized, hey, I can get into debt and pay all the debt completely with my next Apple Payoff. So, I threw another 6K into ads into his videos, which got us to 15K for the month of November. Following the same strategy, increasing the ad spend regularly each week, we close December at 20K, and we're probably going to close January at 40K a month. Well, on that note, for anyone watching this, if they were starting over with an app or they had an app, they're ready to start growing the app. What would be your playbook if you had to start over in 2026? If I was starting over in 2026, this is exactly what I would do. Step one, look for niches with apps doing over 50K a month, use Sensor Tower to get a revenue estimate for the apps. And then step two, find an app you like and improve it substantially. Step three, code it out in less than 2 weeks. This is very important. Set that as your limit cuz otherwise you'd want to improve the product. I've been there, trust me. Step four, do not touch your app. Obsess over distribution. I haven't touched my app in over 3 months now. Just copy the working formats in your niche and start posting at least 20 times a day. Like that's what you should be aiming at at least. And step five, iterate on your onboarding like crazy. Be a maniac. Improve the onboarding until you've at least have a 10% download to trial conversion rate. Later on, you want to do paid ads and you need at least a 10% download to conversion rate. Step six, place ad spend on your organic videos doing more than 10k views. And for this, I'd recommend Tik Tok spark ads more than meta or any other platform. I love that playbook. Hopefully, a lot of people watching this will go and do the same. We didn't really talk too much about what your app does. I really wanted to make this about the build, the growth, and the paid ads, but I would love if you could give me a little demo of what your app does, how simple it is, and how it actually works. &gt;&gt; Super simple. You just go into the app, you choose the apps to block, just block everything, and then you go into the home screen, and when you try to open one of your apps, you'll realize that they're blocked. So, you open it and it prompts you to pray. That will open up the prayer lock app and ask you two questions. How's your relationship with God today? You indicate it. And then, how are you feeling today? Based on that, you're going to get an AI generated prayer that you have to recite in order to unblock your apps. And once you're done reciting your prayer, you press I've prayed today. You choose your next block schedule, which can be the automatic next block schedule, or you can like customize it for 50 minutes or an hour. Once you're done, you get your streak. And finally, a very beautiful Bible verse of the day, and you can doom scroll away or use your phone as you will. It's insane that the super simple app can make so much money, but that's something I've learned. Like the key is in simplicity and actually adding value to your users. Now, I'm curious, how did you actually build this app? Could you walk me through your stack and then also some of the tools you use to grow and do paid ads as well? Cursor for coding and development and that's $20 a month. And Cad GPT for questions and coding and then also of course codec cli which is included in the subscription. So that's $20 a month right now I'm using a lot for quick design iteration $25 a month. Then post hawk for analytics that's around $10 a month. Super wall definitely for pay walls and revenue analytics which is 20 cents per conversion. Then Singular as your MMP, which is basically the software that you use to make paid ads. That's 5 cents per conversion after 15K free conversions. And then for all my backend services and hosting my web pages and everything, I use AWS. That's around $2 a month. Then for the AI inapp services, I use Google Gemini Flash 2.5. It's around $9 a month. Yep, that's pretty much it. That kind of brings the next question of profits and how much are you actually spending on ads to grow this thing? Could you walk me through some of that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, of course. So, uh, paid ads are definitely a little pricey, but they are profitable, so it's worth it. So, right now, I'm spending $360 a day. If we go to the last 30 days, for example, for the month of December, which I closed at pretty much 20K, I spent around 9K. Basically, my my cost per trial right now is at [music] $1.88. Thanks for sharing that and being super transparent, showing me all those paid ads numbers. Last question that we ask all founders who come on to starter story, if you could go back in time to 6 months ago before you started your app or even before that when you were trying to figure out what idea could actually work, what advice would you have to young Mao or to anyone watching this that wants to build apps in 2026 and really crush it like you? I wasted years building stuff nobody wanted. And the reason is because I mean you [music] have so much to learn. So literally do not waste time trying to build the app of your dreams at first. Instead, [music] improve an already successful app. Add your personality. Copy others distribution strategies. And only once you've acquired some experience with apps and distribution, then jump onto even more ambitious things. Thanks, Ma, for coming on. This is amazing. It's super cool to see without a crazy developer background, be [music] able to build something, figure out content even if you didn't have a content background, and then do paid ads, which you didn't even have background [music] there. That's the reality in 2026 is that this is possible. Your story is amazing and it was so awesome to have you on and share all of this. I think people are going to love it. &gt;&gt; Thank you. It was my pleasure. Thanks to Mao for coming on. This is an amazing story. Really hope you are still here watching this right now. If you are, you're one of the OGs. This is one of those stories that it happened just a few months ago, so you know what he's saying is working right now. It's not outdated information. This is super helpful. It shows the power of apps and [music] how fast apps can truly grow. He built it without developer experience. He created content without content experience. And then he started crushing paid ads without [music] experience. He learned all these things on the fly. This is the power of AI tools, not just for building, but for learning and for executing. If you're ready to build your app, again, shameless plug, definitely check out Starter Story Build. If you're serious about actually building something, want to come up with a good idea, execute it on it, and ship it to real users to get real feedback, that is the only thing that matters. If you're serious about it, check it out. I put it in the link in the description. You can get started on your app right [music] now. Okay, that's it for this episode. Thank you guys for watching. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: I built a $14K/month SaaS using Discord
VIDEO ID: 9r0qPeSJGog
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r0qPeSJGog
================================================================================

I built my first SAS around six, seven months ago. And last month, I did over $40,000 in revenue. &gt;&gt; This is Sam, a university student who built a SAS with zero coding [music] background. But here's the even crazier part. He validated this idea in a way I've never seen before. Discord. [music] &gt;&gt; I would mute my mic and literally just share my screen. He found a tiny community, started showing off his product, and [music] just 6 months later, he's at $14,000 a month with over 10,000 users. I got my first 400 users all on Discord. &gt;&gt; This is such a crazy simple strategy that I had to get Sam to come on the channel and break it all down. And that's exactly what he did. And in this video, we'll dive into how he shipped a broken MVP that didn't even work and why that didn't matter. how [music] he went from zero to 10,000 users in just 6 months and how Discord might be the untapped channel to find your first 100 customers. All right, this one you cannot miss. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, Sam, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; My name is Sam. I v coded my first SAS six months ago called Algrow and I've gained over 10,000 users and made over $14,000 in revenue in the last 30 days. And the way that I did this is something that I don't see many founders doing and it's tapping into Discord communities and growing your SAS through there and I'm excited to share that playbook with you today. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Sam, before we get all into Discord, which I think is amazing. I don't even know a whole lot about Discord, which I'm really excited to learn from you. But first, what is the app that you built? You built a SAS. Can you explain what it does? &gt;&gt; So, there are two core features of our product. We help creators research and also replicate viral formats. We have three different pricing plans at the moment. There is a 25 a month plan, a 45 a month plan, and an $80 a month plan. So, as you can see here, we analyze the subscriber counts, the average views per video, and you are given a list of trending formats that are working in real time. And when you find a channel you like, you can have a save and algor if you want to take it a step forward. you can go and create the videos themselves. So if you find a channel for example that was trending with soru, you can plug it into the AI video generator and then generate it inside of algorith download it and then optimize it for whatever platform you post on and then you can post it. &gt;&gt; Okay. Super cool business that you launched. Before we get into the whole Discord strategy and all that, I'd love if you just showed me a little bit more of the metrics behind the business and pulled up some of your Stripe dashboard and just showed us a little bit more about how the business is doing financially. &gt;&gt; All right, no worries. Here is the last four weeks on Algrow and as you can see it's made over £10,000 in revenue and when you convert that into dollars it's around 13 to 14,000. In terms of customers we have exactly 480 new customers this month. So initially when I launched Algrow I launched it as a tool for faceless YouTubers. However in the recent months Algro has grown to influencers using it. I see drop shippers using it. So it has many different use cases now. &gt;&gt; Okay cool. Thank you for sharing your metrics, pulling up your Stripe dashboards and being transparent with all that. I want to understand a little bit more about your background. How do you even get into the idea of building a SAS? &gt;&gt; All right, so I've been around the internet for the past like 3 years looking for different ways to make money. The first way I started was affiliate marketing. Me and my two best friends from home, we worked with a company called Resap and we posted faceless texting stories about different like fake scenarios to help promote their app. and we did over $10,000 in revenue with that company. However, it wasn't sustainable. But I took that money from RZAB and I thought, okay, let me try a different business model. So, I went to something called YouTube automation where you post videos online and make money from ad revenue. And I had a close friend called Mason who first introduced me into the idea of [music] why doesn't someone build a way for us to find more shorts channels to run cuz the more channels you have to run, the more opportunities to make money. And I was like, you know what? I'll try the idea. So, I opened up a notepad and I blurted out on the chat [music] voice mode my whole idea. So, I was given a bunch of code and I was just copying it back and forth into notepad. And then I Googled and I saw something called Visual Studio [music] Code and I still didn't know what to do. So, all I would do is just still copy back and forth, but instead of notepad, I did it on VS Code. And that's how I coded my first ever MVP. However, I showed that to my friend Mason and he was like, "So, raw dogging it in VS Code is dumb when cursor exist and I didn't know what cursor I thought he was talking about a mouse cursor at the time." So, I downloaded it and ever since then I've just been with cursor. &gt;&gt; You basically have no technical experience. How did you teach yourself this? Did you build the whole MVP? How long did it take you to do this with AI coding tools with zero technical experience? &gt;&gt; All right. So the initial MVP that you see it was coded in about a week and that is the version I did on notepad. When I first shipped my product I hosted it on a site called Heroku and the first person I gave it to they got an application error but they still managed to use some of the core features and were able to still use the app. Yes, there were bugs. Yes, there were issues but the main idea of the app was working. So as long as what you're trying to solve works I think you can ship anything. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. You can build anything nowadays. This isn't news. I want to understand about the marketing. How did you get your first customers? And then how did you build this to something that makes over $10,000 a month? &gt;&gt; So, the way I did it is I hopped on a site called discboard.org. Type in any keyword or any niche and it will find you Discord communities with people in that niche. And what I did is at the time there was a server called moneymind. I went to search bar and I typed in the word niches. But the major result that I found was people were searching how do I find a niche or how can I replicate this niche. When I saw that people were repeating how do I find a niche I was like okay that is the demand I see the demand. So I thought let me get a bit more validation. So what I used to do is I would go in that server and I would join a discord voice chat and I would share my screen not talking nothing just me using my tool and I was seeing Sam what are you using at Sam what is this? And I would respond to him being, "Oh, it's a tool I built." And I did this for about like a week straight. It even attracted the eyes of the Discord server owner to the point that he created a YouTube long form promotional video on the tool. I didn't ask him. I didn't pay for it. I didn't do anything. And then after weeks of just sitting in the Discord server and screen sharing, I thought, how can I get these people to convert to my product? And I saw the typical thing was for a SAS to release a weight list. And I was able to send that weight list to those Discord servers. So I would put in the Discord server in the chat just the wait list and be like if you want to try the tool just sign up here and once it's released we'll get an email something like that and that's how Algro started. &gt;&gt; Man I just love hearing how Sam went out and found his customers through this platform called Discord. It's really something that I haven't seen or heard of that much. I mean I hear a lot about Reddit and Facebook groups but not Discord. And if you stick around to the end you're going to hear him break down his entire process. But it got me thinking about all the niche communities that are out there where you can go find customers. I get a lot of DMs from you guys about where is the best place to post my product and get my first customer. But the truth is there are a million places to do it and it's different for every type of business and customer that you're trying to reach. Honestly, it's easy to get lost or confused and potentially even pick the wrong distribution channel. And I know a lot of you guys watching might not know exactly where to start. So, I decided to put something together for you for free where you can find your perfect distribution channel. Again, this is all free. I put together the ultimate playbook of how to find customers through niche communities, not only Discord, but Reddit, Facebook groups, and all sorts of places where you can find customers for free. And this is all based on real data and real examples from successful founders that I talked to through this YouTube channel and also through Starter Story. This is important because it's what is actually working and you can download the whole thing for free right now. Just click the link in the description to get it, but it won't be free forever. All right, let's get back to the interview. Discord is this untapped market almost, but I assume that Discord has a huge spam problem. Why didn't you get banned? Why did people love your stuff so much they were willing to self-promote it? What did you do, right? What would be your advice for other people who want to nail Discord distribution? &gt;&gt; Most Discord communities that you join have server rules, and in the rules, it always says no self-promo or else you'll be banned. And most people see that and what they'll do still is go in the server and be like, "Hi, I've got this tool. Please use it." But you just look like spam. You look like an annoying person. And I think the main thing you have to do first is build maybe a bit of rapport in the community. A person would give me like a type of channel they were looking for and I would use my tool to help them find that channel. So I wasn't directly selling it to them cuz at the end of the day, those people would tell their friends. Word of mouth was so big for me at the beginning. just because it solves a painoint that is so big, people will end up telling other people. I asked them, "Where did you come from?" They'd be like, "Oh, my friend told me." &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. This is amazing. Could you give me the playbook on how you would get customers from niche communities or specifically Discord if you had to start over today? &gt;&gt; So, [music] the first step that I would have for you is to find where your ICP lives. Attempt to find [music] if there is a Discord community for your niche. Let's say we're going to build a SAS that creates 3D assets or something. So, what I would do is I would go on Discord and have a look at the Blender servers, their outputs, and I would join every single one of them and do the same thing for Cinema 4D. And then for step two, I would say you need to listen before [music] you build anything. One cool thing about Discord is you can scroll through and copy and paste days and days worth of chat history. Copy and paste it into Chatbutt and give it a prompt saying, "List me all of the pain points [music] that these people have talked about over the last couple days." You want to be looking for recurring pain points because those are the ones that would have more demand. So the more struggle there is, the more likely the product is [music] going to do to do better in my opinion. Step three, now you want to validate your ideas by having real conversations with people. So once you DM these people, you need to have a goal in mind. Drop them a screen recording of or whatever, like a quick loom that's sped up of your tool. [music] And if you see them like give great feedback like on my days, this is something I've been looking for. something like that. That is a strong indicator that you're building the correct thing. However, I say at least try and find five, six different people [music] in different servers as well. Step four, I would say you should build in public with the community. I don't mean the whole Twitter build in public where you document the process of you building your SAS. I genuinely think that's a whole bunch of rubbish, but that's my personal opinion on it. I think that you should build your product with your users. So, if you think you can collect enough users, then just build a weight list and get the emails ready. But another really cool thing you can do beyond a wait list is make your own Discord server for your future [music] product. So, instead of being scared of getting banned for self-promo in the big communities, you can start growing your own private Discord community and then you're funneling in your ideal customers. And I'm all for emails. I think emails are great, but Discord is 10 times better in terms of building a relationship with your users. I think young people will go on Discord more than they check their emails. So, for step five, another thing you want to do is turn all of your early users into potential advocates for your product. So, one thing I did is I gave all of my early users to help me validate my idea. I gave them all free access. So, the early access user would have free access, then his friend would have to pay, but his friend might be a bit skeptical on how the tool works. But the really cool thing is the early access user can just show him because he has free access and that is how our group grew as quick as it did cuz I post it in these communities and these people would tell their friends and that is how it initially blew up. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Want to change topics on a second. I know that you vibe coded this without technical background. What's your tech stack? How did you build this and what tools do you use? &gt;&gt; So I've upgraded from the $20 a month cursor plan to the $200 a month cursor plan and then I have an AI image generation feature inside of our growth. of that is based off Nano Banana where I'm paying around I'd say $100 a month. There's also AI video generation which uses models like Sora 2 and I'll say I'm paying around $200 a month. Hosting now cost me about $100 a month. I'm still on Heroku. And then in terms of email marketing, I use a site called Mailorite and it costs around $80 a month. And in terms of like different AI compute now other cost of Gemini, I say it goes to around $300 to $500 per month. Cool. Last question that we ask every founder who comes onto the channel. If you could go back in time, what would be your advice to young Sam or for anyone watching this who wants to build a 10K plus per month business? &gt;&gt; My main advice for people would be build your tool to accommodate for scale. You need to initially bet on yourself. Think that, okay, cool. I'm going to have 100,000 users building my tool. And you want to have the frameworks behind that. and you might not know them, but when you tell cursor to think that way, it will change its mindset in the way it prompts you to do things, it will prompt you in a way that will accommodate for those 100,000 users instead of [music] just that one user being you, cuz then it saves you so much time and money down the line. &gt;&gt; Well, that's great advice for anyone watching this. Vibe coding, building stuff, believe in yourself. Thanks, Sam, for coming on to the channel. Amazing strategy Discord. I love it. So, thanks for coming on and sharing everything so transparently. &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me on. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you to Sam for coming on to the channel and sharing all that. I'll bring Gus, our producer, on. What do you think of this one, Gus? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that was pretty awesome. My big takeaway is like there's a million places to find customers, but Discord is just not something I've ever thought about. Maybe maybe I'm just old. Like I don't use Discord, so that's probably part of the problem. &gt;&gt; Yeah, he did sort of mention this a couple times is like he said, "My users are younger and they're on Discord. They don't check their email." I think that's really important. And if you're going to build this business and then you're going to go promote it on LinkedIn, that that's not going to work, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah. Just crazy to think like there's these tiny places or pockets on the internet. It's pretty cool. A million different places to go find people. You just got to like understand a certain niche really well [music] to know where to go look. &gt;&gt; And what I thought was cool in the early days, he didn't even have the ability to build any software, but he just built something super niche. I think that's super cool and it's what I would recommend for anyone to do who wants to get started today, who wants to build stuff, go to small community, solve a really, really niche problem for a really, really niche customer. Uh, you could probably vibe code something really quickly and just start getting interest and validation. So, if you're looking to do that and you want to build something quickly, I definitely check out Starter Story Build. It is our platform. We will teach you how to build and vibe code products to production in just a couple weeks. You'll come up with your idea, you'll build it, and you'll launch it to real users who might be on Discord just like Sam did. I'll put a link in the description for that. Our next cohorts are starting this week. If you're looking to start and build and get off the sidelines and build something, definitely check it out. Thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: How My App Hit $60K/Month in 2 Months
VIDEO ID: XifgHi9R5Rc
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XifgHi9R5Rc
================================================================================

Our sauce made $30,000 in 4 days. &gt;&gt; This is Lara. She's the co-founder of Cleo, which launched [music] last month and did $30,000 MR in 4 days. Now, I know what you're thinking. And you're right. Obviously, they didn't build and launch this product in 4 days, but they did go from 0 to $30,000 MR in just a few days thanks to a very different approach to launching a SAS. Here's what everybody gets wrong [music] about launching ASAs. &gt;&gt; I asked Laura to come on to the channel to break down her entire launch strategy for me, including the unexpected marketing channel that got [music] thousands of people on their weight list, the exact email sequence they used to convert hundreds [music] of paying customers overnight and their step-by-step playbook that you can use to launch your SAS in 2026. This is one that you cannot miss. [music] I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. Welcome to the channel, Lara. Tell me about who you are, what SAS you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; So, hi, my name is Lara Costa, and me and my co-founders built a B2B SAS that made 30K in 4 days. So, this is Cleo, and what it does is basically it's a ghostriter put in your pocket. So, for every founder that is trying to grow on LinkedIn, we solve that very specific problem. It's powered by AI. It thinks like you, it writes like you, and it creates content better than you. We literally launched it in October of 2025 and we've gone from zero to $60,000 a month in less than 2 months. And the way we did all of this was by using the Cleo launch playbook. So, I'm so excited to talk about it today. &gt;&gt; Real quick, our audience watching this, we really want to make sure that this is this is legit. This is real. Would you be able to pull up your dashboard and show some of your revenue metrics, prove you're building this, and show me a little bit about what happened when you did this weight list? &gt;&gt; Yeah, of course. So, this is our Polar. This is where we literally launched everything. [music] Yeah. As you can see here, we're already at 62K MR and we have over 932 active subscriptions, over a,000 in total. And you can see the clear spike here on active users from October 1st. The reason why we were able to do this so fast within day one of launch was because we built a [music] weight list. The way we did it was we had many launches which were to our weight list only. [music] So even if you go to our landing page right now which I can show you here, you cannot physically buy the product. You need to join a weight list. [music] Why we did this was to build scarcity, FOMO and also soft sell it to our audience. So it didn't feel like we were pushing product because it was a secret. No one knew unless you knew. So that's why we saw two different spikes. The first one was when we launched to our original weight list and the second one when was when we relaunched. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, this weight list strategy is amazing. But before we get into all that, which we are going to do, I want to understand a little bit more about your background. How do you even come up with the idea to start Cleo? How does it get started? &gt;&gt; Well, it all starts with LinkedIn. I started posting on LinkedIn around 3 years ago because what I realized and most people realized when they joined LinkedIn is that all decision makers are on that platform. And so you can build a business off the back of creating content. So I started posting on LinkedIn. I built two businesses off the back of it. And then in that journey I met my co-founder Jake who was also in a very similar situation like me. So my background is both in agency and the info product businesses. I took the marketing concepts from that business and understood the idea of FOMO building weight list using emails and webinars and we took [music] it to SAS. I love info but we wanted to do something different and build a software tool. So, me knowing what I knew and then our co-founders knowing what they knew, we combined it and created this insane launch strategy in under two months. &gt;&gt; All right, Laura, let's talk about this launch strategy, which I think is amazing and uh it's unlike anything I've ever seen before. So, I really really want to dig into that and talk all about that. Can you explain exactly how this works high level how you were able to launch and hit like 30k MR in basically a day? Can you explain it? How does it work? Yeah. So, the way Cleo was able to go from zero to 30K MR in its first month was simple. We used the Cleo playbook and it's three parts. Content, weight list, and webinars. We haven't even launched to the public yet. The first launch and second launches were beta launches straight to our weight list. And the thing is, no one is doing it like this. Everybody's doing it the opposite way where they launch something and they promote it. We did it the opposite way, which was the most important part for us. Creating that scarcity, curiosity, and demand for a product people hadn't even seen yet. Our customers and my clients have been able to hit 50K, 60K, and 70K following the exact same playbook. It can work for anyone, no matter how big or small your following is. &gt;&gt; That's amazing. And I think that this is a totally different way of thinking about how to build SAS. I think it's actually genius. And I want you to dive in a little bit deeper though on how you guys did this. What was the first thing you did? did I know you said building a weight list. How do you build a weight list and how do you drive interest or attention to that weight list? Could you share with me exactly how to do that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so the approach that we took was obviously educating on LinkedIn fast because we're all LinkedIn native creators. So we had multiple posts that drove demand to this weight list. So this is one of the posts not from me and not from Jake from our other account called the LinkedIn creator. You can see that there is no call to action. There is no direct plug. It's simply educating. This is something that Jay called edu selling where you're basically telling people what they need to know. You're answering their biggest problems. So, for example, here is how to write the best LinkedIn tips I found. We're telling them what they want to know and then at [music] the end we show them where they can actually get more results using our tool. This leads them to sign up to our weight list. A different post, for example, by Jake is he's stating a problem here and then he's literally just talking about the typical problems that every founder, entrepreneur, and creator have when they're creating content on the platform. Again, you can't see ACTA. It's simply creating this awareness and taking mind share of Cleo. So, that's how we've done it over time. &gt;&gt; Okay, so $30,000 in a few days is insane. If you stick around to the end of the video, you're going to see exactly how they did it. But here's what I really love about their story. Lara figured out how to build hype around her product. And she did it all through creating content. This is the secret to building a SAS or any app or any business online in 2026. [music] Distribution. If you can crack distribution, then you give yourself the opportunity to win. And the number one way to create your own distribution for free is to simply start creating content and building an audience. This is so important that I decided to put together our playbook to help [music] you get your first,000 followers. Which might not sound like a lot, but 1,000 followers is where real products get created and real distribution channels get started. Almost every founder that I talk to on this channel has some sort of personal brand. It is essential in [music] 2026 to be creating content online about your product and sharing it with the world. This playbook that I created for you will go over a bunch of real data and examples from actually successful founders that I've talked to on this channel and what's working right now to create actual businesses that generate revenue. We'll go over what type of content to create, how to get your first thousand followers, and how to create content that drives customers to your business. Just click the link in the description to get it, but it won't be free forever. All right, let's get back to the interview. Okay, so you guys over the course of 6 months to a year, it doesn't happen overnight, but you built up trust. You built up this weight list to thousands of people. What happens next? How do you actually get your product in front of those people? How do you turn those into paying customers? &gt;&gt; Again, another typical mistake that most founders do is that they build this weight list [music] and they never nurture it. Nurturing your list is one of the main things that you need to do as a founder or someone that wants to build a product and ship it to [music] the public. 4 weeks before we launched the actual product live to our wait list, we warmed up the list showing people why they needed our tool without actually directly selling it to them. And so you can see our first email that we ever sent pre-launch was the problem with AI content and why [music] we're different. What we did is we emphasized the problem that people were thinking about. So the problem with AI content, everybody can write with AI. So we knew that we knew that the number one objection was how is this better than chbpt or claw that is free [music] for us. So we got there we kind of like tested different headlines and said why most AI content fails before it even starts. Then we laid out exactly what the problem was. But it isn't an AI AI problem. It's a differentiation problem which then makes people agree with us. That then led to them being engaged into the weight list. You can see here there's no CTA. There's no, oh, we're it's coming soon. Nothing. Simply educating people on the problem that they have so we can build trust rather than just sell them. So now, as you can see, we did over 10 emails before the drop. So then the actual email when we went live, we actually told them, "Hey, Cleo 2.0 is [music] live. Try it now." And the reason why we were able to do that successfully was because we had built that urgency, scarcity, and desire for a product that we told them was going to fix [music] every single one of the problems that they have with writing, building a personal brand, LinkedIn algorithms, and using AI. And then we told them, hey, Cleo is live. Try it here. We immediately within the first line because we wanted to drive as much attention as fast as possible because we [music] had pre-built that trust. So the emails that I was showing were literally the reason why we were able to get to 30K MR and then 60K MR. It wasn't just viral content. It was emails. And this is something most people are sleeping on. Everybody's expecting viral content to work and convert, but it's actually emails where the customers are and are actually buying from because you're not competing with an algorithm. &gt;&gt; Amazing. This strategy is awesome. You guys executed so well. That brings me to my next question. For anyone watching this, maybe they built a SAS, maybe they built an app, maybe they're just starting to create content. If you were to start over today, imagine you didn't have any audience. What would be the step-by-step playbook to launch a SAS in 2026? &gt;&gt; So, where I would start obviously is building a personal brand on LinkedIn. And it doesn't have to be the most viral. You don't have to be an expert. You just have to be useful. So, if you're a beginner that wants to start posting on LinkedIn, the thing that you need to understand is what is your unfair advantage and what can you educate people on, right? Your unfair advantages could be your story or the tactical subject that you have expertise [music] on. You can actually create educational content just about that. And that would literally give you the following that you need to then launch something else. And then [music] if you're wondering about the step-by-step playbook on how to build a personal brand, I have a framework called the 4 321. So ideally, you want to post four times a week. That's it. Not five, not six, not seven. Don't overwhelm yourself. Focus on the quality rather than the quantity. then three content pillars that you need to be using. So educational storytelling and [music] then sales generating content. This could be lead magnets. And the second thing the two in that 4 through2 is the two types of audiences you want to be marketing to. You have your ICP, your ideal client persona and you have your IFP and that is your ideal follower persona. So when you're creating content for these two types of personas, you can get leads and demand or weightless signups, but you also get a community that pushes you, likes your content, engages with you every single day, and eventually over time can also buy from you. So the last part of the 4321 [music] was lead magnets. And now how you build them is super simple. You literally only have to create a Google document explaining something or a loom or something else that you already have. Maybe it's a part of your process and then you give it out to people for free and the only thing that you ask for is their email. You send them the lead magnet. They sign up to your email newsletter to get that lead magnet and all the time you just nurture them. And so while you're building in public, creating all of this content, you know, taking hours of your time writing this amazing content that potentially will go viral. The way to guarantee your success is to have that weight list in the background building. So when you want to launch something, when you want to offer something, you can. Step number three, which is my favorite, is webinars. You can do two types of lives, a LinkedIn live or you can do a Zoom webinar. For lunch number one, we just did one LinkedIn live, which is literally on LinkedIn. You're going live like you would on Instagram or X. [music] You tell people that you're going to do it. You create a simple post about it, just highlighting what it is going to be about. And then whoever signs up gets a notification directly on LinkedIn that you're going live. All you need is one topic to educate on for the first 20 minutes. Then the next 20 minutes is going to be a walkthrough or a demo. And then the third bit is you're going to be pitching the product, sending the link, tell them where to buy. When you're able to show up as a human, people actually connect with you with your mannerisms, with how you look, with where you live, with how you sound. So [music] that's what allowed us to literally hit the 30K in 4 days. Once you have your first couple users or even before you launch or when you're doing better launches like we did ourselves, the thing that you need to focus on to make sure that the product is perfect is hop on calls or DM customers directly to ask them for direct support. What we did was we were going on VIP white globe onboarding calls where we literally took people through the product so they could use it correctly. Because the reason why most people stop using software is because they don't understand it. It's not because it doesn't work. So, we tried our best to make sure that [music] every single one of our customers at the start was able to use that product correctly. [music] So, then they could stay on for longer. They gave us an amazing testimonial and then they became Cleo [music] Evangelist. but also in the background we were recording those calls to make sure that we spotted patterns in thinking [music] in problems in bugs in issues that people were having so we could actually fix them immediately. So it was also an iteration play for us so we could have the best product available as fast as possible. So then step number five, what you need to also do is think about how can you get the most demand as fast as possible. You build your weight list and then to incentivize customers to buy, you offer them a lifetime discount or something that feels exclusive. You're trying to push someone to buy. And there's many ways to do it. Psych with psychology, you can do it through curiosity, you could do it through scarcity, or you could do it through FOMO. [music] We tried all of them, but the one that worked best at the start was scarcity. We told people we only have 500 spots available, which made people want to take action faster. When something's available so easily, people don't want to buy it immediately. So, you need to add that incentive for people to go in and buy and also feel exclusive. And also, if you want to add something else, you can offer them a lifetime discount, which is what we did. We told them this is 50% off for a lifetime. If you buy now, you will never have to pay the newer price ever again. And then number six, you need to not share your customers. Most people just launch things and they forget about them and then just, you know, go celebrate the MR. What we're doing actively at Cleo is we're keeping in touch closely with every single one of our customers. One of our co-founders, Rob, he's literally given his personal number to every single one of our users so they can make sure that they're using the tool right, that they feel supported. Most people don't do that. But the thing is, you need to be doing the things that don't scale if you want to scale faster. So, if I was starting over all over from scratch, that's exactly what I would do. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, thank you for sharing that playbook, Laura. I think it's amazing. I think a lot of people are going to really enjoy that and should implement it, especially uh if they're building a SAS. Changing topics real quick. I want to understand tech stack behind Cleo. How did you guys build the app? How did you build the SAS? What do you use day-to-day to run the business &gt;&gt; to build Cleo? Actually, we use Claude and Claude code. Then we use Nex.js for the TypeScript for the code. Then Vasel and Vasel chat. Then Vasel again for hosting and then clerk for authentication. For the operations and monetization, we use Slack for communication. We use loops for emails. currently for onboarding calls and then Fernandan for managing those emails for support and then to monetize we used Polar and Polo's native landing page. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Well, thank you for sharing that. Last question that we ask everyone who comes on to starter story if you could go back in time before you launch the SAS that had this amazing launch. What would be your advice to young Lara or for anyone watching this that wants to launch a SAS in 2026? &gt;&gt; I would say two things. Number one is build a personal brand on LinkedIn. No matter how much you think it's cringe, if you want to make money, LinkedIn is your best shot. Twitter is cool, Instagram is cool, but LinkedIn is so much better. There's just not no competition at all. So, that's one thing. Build your personal brand. Educate on a important topic that you already know. And if you don't know it very well, you'll learn it through writing about it consistently. The second thing, build an email list. You never know when you're going to lose access to your social media platforms. You never know when you'll need to actually promote something. So, it's better to actually build and then nurture that list instead of trying to do it once. You have to do it before you need to. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Well, thank you for that amazing advice. I think a lot of people watching this are going to love this strategy. I think it's a totally different way of thinking about how to launch a SAS from a marketer's perspective. A lot of people watching this video may be very focused on building features and doing things the old way, but this is this is amazing. So, thanks for coming on, Laura. Thank you for having me. People have our entire playbook, so I hope they see it. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you to Laura for coming on to the channel. I'll bring our producer Gus on right now. Gus, what did you think about that one? &gt;&gt; What I really loved about that just how strategic everything was. For myself personally, I'm just kind of creating stuff online, just posting like whatever I'm thinking about. And this was like very strategic like the weight list and the type of content they created and the signups and the emails that you saw. So, I thought that was pretty interesting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, sometimes you can just look at the math of things, right? Like &gt;&gt; the goal is maybe a fraction like 1% or maybe even less actually show up and sign up for your weight list and then you kind of know at that point, okay, if I have a weight list of 10,000 people and I can convert 1% of them, that's 100 paying customers. It's a numbers game, right? Do I'm sure if you did the math on what their conversion was, maybe they converted 1% of people on their weight list to that. I mean, that means 99% of people are rejecting them, right? more people that watch this channel that are builders should go learn from marketers like Lara and people that are in other niches on on how they convert customers [music] and and how they get paying customers. That that's really the sauce here. I don't know what you think about that. &gt;&gt; And the last thing is just, you know, what they said about LinkedIn. I feel like [music] I don't know if you'll catch me making content on LinkedIn, but like she said, there's so many there's so few people doing it on there that it's like probably a huge opportunity if you can get over that. &gt;&gt; If there are more creators than consumers, it's bad for you because it's harder to stand out. But if there are more consumers than creators, like on LinkedIn, I think that's very true. There's just not that many people creating because they're worried about feeling cringe or whatever their boss is on there, whatever, that's where the money is, [music] the sauce is, right? And I think you can build a great business. On that note, if you're looking to build something, it's all about distribution. It's about doing launch, but you got to build something. You got to have something that uh people can use. Definitely check out Starter Story Build. It is our program where you will come up with an idea, you'll build it, and you'll launch it to actual people like they did at Cleo. If you are ready to get off the sidelines and actually build something, look, it may not be a million-dollar idea, but get something out there, get feedback, get it into the market. That's what Starter Story Build is all about. I'll put a link in the description for you to sign up, get started. More cohorts are launching this week. If you're ready to get started right now, definitely check it out. All right, that's it for this one. Thank you guys for watching. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: How I built my first SaaS without an audience ($25K/month)
VIDEO ID: FCGpgPZqmkY
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCGpgPZqmkY
================================================================================

I took everything that I knew and built my first SAS. &gt;&gt; Meet Hassam, a non-technical guy who launched an app with Cursor. &gt;&gt; So, I spent literally all day for the next 48 hours building it out. And this is what I did. But he had no audience, no distribution, and no way to reach customers. So, he did something I've never seen anyone do before. He found a distribution channel overnight. Then, 90 days later, his app was doing over $20,000 a month. If you can spend 1,000 hours on a project and implement your domain knowledge, you're going to be successful. So, I asked Ham to come on to the channel and share exactly how he did it. And in this video, we'll get into how to find the perfect business idea customized [music] to you, how to save yourself years figuring out distribution, and [music] his six-step playbook on how he would do this all again if he had to start over today. All right, let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. All right, Hassam, welcome to the channel. Stoked to have you here. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; I'm Ham, and I turned my Amazon business into Launch Fast. I built it with Cursor in 48 hours. I pitched it to a coaching company with a massive audience, and now we're earning 20K plus MR. I'm excited to share my story with you today. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's amazing that you did it so fast. Before we get into how you built it and everything, I do want to understand what is this business? Is this SAS? What is it? Yeah. So, Launchfast is an AI powered Amazon product research tool and is built specifically for private label sellers. So, it helps you find, validate, and source products all in a matter of minutes instead of weeks. And the growth timeline has been pretty steady since we launched. Day zero, we launched with the partnership with Legacy X. And about 30 days in, we were at 10K MRR. Around day 60, we were at 17 to 18K with steady growth. And now, 90 days in, we're at about 21.8K. 8K. We offer a $50 a month pricing to the coaching customers of Legacy X and we have the regular pricing model for $1.99 per month for the general public. We also have a official Chrome extension with 330 active users and all our users are paying because I feel like we launched in a unique niche built specifically for that audience. &gt;&gt; That's really impressive, man. To be doing over $20,000 MR in 90 days is amazing. This is a super cool story. Before we get into how you built this and everything, I want to understand a little bit about your background. Do you have a coding background? Are you a developer? What's your background? &gt;&gt; So, I have a non-technical background. I was working a corporate job while running two Amazon brands on the side. Just a classic side hustle grind. Because of Twitter, I discovered cursor and AI tools early on before general purpose. And I was so fascinated that I finally had the power to build things without a CS degree. I built about 10 to 12 projects across different spaces. Most of them never made it to production, but I did learn something from each project. So, when I eventually started building tools for my own Amazon business, I realized that I have something most developers don't, and that's the niche domain knowledge on Amazon. So, I thought that instead of solving theoretical problems for sellers, I could build a tool I wish I really had as an Amazon seller. So, decided I'm going to put cursor to use and I built the tool to monetize my knowledge. Okay, I want to dive real quick into the idea because you had mentioned that you had 10 to 12 failed projects, but then this one was the idea that really took off. Walk me through how you found that idea and how you sort of knew that this could be something big. Honestly, this idea came out of pure frustration. While I was launching products, I was spending 20 to 30 hours researching each product idea, copy pasting data into Google Sheets. It was honestly exhausting. And all the tools I tried, I just felt like they had the same problem. They look like they were solving important problems on paper but they didn't tackle the real bottlenecks. But the thing is while I had this idea I also realized that I had zero audience and zero audience means zero distribution. So even if I did build the best tool out there no one's going to know about it and it's not really going to matter. And that's when I remembered that 2 years ago I had actually bought a coaching program called Legacy X. And Legacy X already had the distribution. and they had thousands of active Amazon sellers just looking for a new tool. So instead of trying to build an audience and my own distribution, which can sometimes take years, I thought that I'd just partner with somebody who already had the distribution. And I guess I would be giving up equity, but I would get instant access to my target customers. Okay, so super smart there. You kind of solved the problem that a lot of builders run into, which is AI tools can help me build it really quick, but now I have a way bigger problem, which is distribution. I really really like how you saw this idea. Can you explain to me how you solved the distribution problem? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so I reached out to Legacy X and I said, "Guys, I can build you a better product research tool than anything on the market." So I told them, "Give me 48 hours and if you like what we see, we can partner. No strings attached and you guys have nothing to lose." So I spent literally all day for the next 48 hours building it out. And this is what I did. For the first four hours, I mapped out their existing systems and SOPs, what data they had, workflows they use, and then I combined it with my own processes to build the MVP foundation. Once I had that, for hours 5 to 12, I started using Cursor to build out the core features. It didn't have to be perfect, but as long as it was functional, it was going to be good. And then from there, I spent hours 13 to 20 testing bugs, iterating, and cursor was a lifesaver here. And at hours 21 to 30, I thought I would spend a lot of time polishing the UI and making it look professional. Something I learned from Amazon is that branding is everything. So, I put the branding in and made it feel like a real product. After that, hours 31 to 40, it was more testing again, testing out the edge cases, making sure I put everything together and it worked fluently. After that, it was just the final polish, prepping the demo, and then from there, I recorded the video and sent it over. Next day, I woke up to the call, hey, quit your job. We're going to do this full-time. And from there, that's when I felt like the pitch was worth it. Even though I traded equity for this instant distribution, I knew that I was going to get instant validation. And now I literally had a built-in customer base. So, when it comes to software, instead of me sacrificing other resources that can be more valuable than equity, such as my time, I would trade that any day to get access to someone else's distribution. Even if it's at 50%, I would say 50% of 20K MR is better than 50% of zero MR. &gt;&gt; What I love about Ham's story is that he did it with zero coding experience. He had an idea. He shipped it with cursor and with the right distribution strategy, he hit $20,000 a month. So I wanted to ask you, what's your idea? What have you been planning to build? And are you ready? Now AI is making it possible for anyone to become a builder. and Ham is perfect proof of that. If you've made it to this point in the video, I think you might want to become a builder, too. So, I want to invite you to check out Starter Story Build. [music] It's our program where we teach you how to build apps with AI. And in just a few weeks, you'll go from idea to launch and finally build that idea that's sitting in your head right now. Our next boot camp starts soon. So, if you're ready to build, head to the first link in the description to join Starter Story Build. All right, let's get back to the video. I'm also curious about another thing. You mentioned that you had like 10 to 12 products that went nowhere. Why do you think that this product really took off? &gt;&gt; I felt like this project was successful over others because I had niche domain knowledge in the Amazon world. Previously, I was trying to launch products like Leric AI video generators or automating job applications. I didn't really know what the end user wanted or why the current softwares weren't living up to their hype. With the Amazon world, I already understood from A to Z what problems new sellers were running into, what data they needed. That's why I feel like putting my domain knowledge into Launch Fast was successful versus the graveyard in my GitHub. And honestly, I think every person has a niche hobby or interest that they're into. And with access to AI now, you have the chance to monetize that knowledge. You probably know problems and solutions better than anybody in those niches. If you turn them into software, productize it properly, and get the solutions into the hands of other people, there's a huge opportunity waiting for you. &gt;&gt; This is something that I 100% agree with, and it's something I tell a lot of people who join Starter Story is pick an idea where you have domain knowledge, where you have knowledge, where you have skills. Go build something in there and you won't have to waste two years learning about a whole new domain. For anyone watching this who's maybe questioning, what is my domain knowledge? Or if I have domain knowledge, how do I get started? What would be your playbook if you had to start over today finding [music] and then building on some domain knowledge? &gt;&gt; If I were starting today, here's the exact steps that I would take. So, step one is going to be to identify your domain knowledge and then write down three to five industries or domains where you have deep knowledge and you've personally solved problems. The step two would be to find validated markets. So, from those three to five domains, you're going to look for niches that already have successful SAS tools. If they're already making money, that means the market exists. We can use tools like Sensor Tower, RFS, or even Google Console just to find other competitors that are doing well within these niches. So, the key here is that you don't need a unique idea. You're just going to execute better in a proven market. Step three is going to be to do a deep dive on user pain points. So, we're going to go where those customers actually hang out. We're going to dive deep into Reddit, Facebook groups, Twitters, and even review sites. We're going to identify who the user is, what their ultimate goal is, and what are the current defects in the tools you're using. Step four is going to be to build the MVP. We're going to build the one feature with the highest ROI potential yet the easiest implementation. Don't worry about getting it perfect. Just make sure it's functional and get it into the hands of users as fast as possible. Step five, we're not going to try to build this audience from scratch. We're going to see who already has access to our target customers. Is it coaching companies? Is it communities? Or is it other influencer groups? We're going to send them the demo and we're going to offer them a partnership for access to the distribution. And just remember that 50% of something is a lot better than 100% of nothing. So start listing out five potential distribution partners and try to reach out to three by the end of this week. Step six is after we launch, we're going to have to ship daily and we're going to iterate fast based on real user feedback. We're going to take actionable insights from their feature requests, from bugs, and what things break, take their feedback, and commit to shipping at least one improvement every day for the next 30 days. To wrap up the playbook, just remember that you no longer need to be an engineer to build production software. If you can spend 1,000 hours on a project, test it thoroughly, and implement your domain knowledge, you're going to be successful. &gt;&gt; Amazing. Thank you for sharing that playbook. I think it's super cool. I want to change the topic slightly. As someone who doesn't have a crazy development background, what is your tech stack for building a SAS right now? What have you used for your product? &gt;&gt; So, this is a tech stack that literally anybody can use to go from idea to MVP in 48 hours to write the code. We're going to use cursor. We're going to host on Verscell and Verscell is great because we can host right from cursor. We're going to deploy it with the CLI and it's going to be no friction or configuration. We're going to use superbase to do our database O and storage. This is going to replace Firebase and with the Superbase MCP there's going to be no friction in implementing it with cursor. We're going to make sure all of our onboarding emails are personalized and we're going to send that with the email for developers which is resend. We're going to use Apify because a lot of niches depend on data aggregation and Apify is going to simplify the collection for us and it's going to be critical for some niches and we're going to make sure that we build the app on Typescript and Nex.js JS just because this is the most modern and AI friendly stack and you're going to find cursor works a lot better with this tech stack. So the great thing about this stack is once you launch your costs are going to be pretty minimal. Cursor is going to be the only one with their max subscription at $200 and until you hit that winning product you won't have hurt your pockets too much. The last question that we ask everyone who comes on starter story, if you could stand on young Hassam's shoulders before you had built any software or for anyone watching this that wants to build software, find distribution like you did as well. What would be your advice? &gt;&gt; If you're an ideas person, you're somebody who sees problems, imagine solutions, you can now use AI to build those solutions. Feel like AI tools have really closed the gap between idea and execution. So I would tell Hassan to just stop waiting, stop planning, just start building. try to ship something this weekend, just get it in front of at least 10 people, listen to their feedback, iterate, and ship again. And if it doesn't work, just repeat it. I feel like the tools exist, the knowledge exists, and that the only thing stopping you from shipping is yourself. So, just ship and keep shipping. &gt;&gt; Well, that's amazing advice, Assam. Thank you for coming on. $20,000 MR in 90 days is amazing. This is such a great example of what's possible in 2025 and beyond. So, thanks for coming on. Thanks for sharing everything, being transparent, and uh good luck in the future. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much. &gt;&gt; That was pretty fun. What do you think? What's your takeaways? &gt;&gt; I mean, this story is absolutely insane. This guy who didn't know how to code, who didn't have an audience, he built the app in 48 hours. Obviously, they probably took some equity, maybe 50% equity in that, but now he's making $10,000 a month pure profit. And the business was started in 2025, which is the year we're in right now. Would you think? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's just such a smart strategy like especially for people who have no audience or small audience. It's like a hack. It's a new way of thinking like oh how do I get customers? You always think well Reddit and Twitter and all this stuff and I hadn't thought of something like this before. So yeah, that's that's what I'll take away for sure. &gt;&gt; I think some a lot of people out there just no offense but you suck at finding customers. You suck at marketing and it's going to take a long time for you to get better. This is a great way to shortcut that. You don't have to sell half your app for the next app you build or the next app you build. But for the first one, that's a pretty good deal. I would take that any day of the week. But again, reminder that none of this would be possible without the knowledge on how to build apps and an idea. So if you were inspired by Hassam, you want to learn how to build stuff quickly. Well, that's exactly what we teach you in Starter Story Build. In a couple weeks, you'll come up with an idea. We'll teach you how to build it with AI tools and we'll teach you how to launch it into the real world and get it into the hands of real customers so that you can do it over and over and over again until you become great like Hassam. And if you are ready to get off the sidelines and get building, check it out. All right, guys. See you in the next one. Peace.

================================================================================

I never in my wildest imaginations expect to get numbers like this. &gt;&gt; Meet Rob Hallum, a solo developer you've probably seen all over X in the last few months. But what you might not know about Rob is that he wasn't always successful. He failed for years until he discovered one platform that changed everything. X. &gt;&gt; I built this entire business through sharing my story on X. &gt;&gt; Rob simply started posting on X, sharing the wins, the losses, everything. And to his surprise, it turned into followers, users, sales, and ultimately a very successful SAS business. &gt;&gt; I went viral first and then got the followers second. &gt;&gt; Rob might be one of the best minds when it comes to building a public. So, I asked him to come on to the channel to break down his story and how he went from 0 to $12,000 a month building on X and posting content. And in this video, we'll dive into the insane opportunity of building a public right now. Rob's exact content system that he uses every day to grow on X and his step-by-step playbook on how to build in public and get thousands of followers if he had to start over from scratch today. &gt;&gt; Unlike what I thought was the case, it isn't about luck. &gt;&gt; This is one that you cannot miss. Let's dive in. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. &gt;&gt; What's up, Rob? Welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. My name is Rob Palam. I built SuperX, which is a platform that helps you grow on X the right way. I launched it publicly four months ago, and since then, we've gone from 1,000 to over $13,000 in monthly recurring revenue, now growing at 25% month over month. The crazy thing is, I built the entire business on X itself, using SuperX to grow SuperX. I'm living proof the system works because I've gone from zero to over 34,000 followers in just over a year. And that's the playbook, Building in Public, that I'm excited to share with you today. Rob, I'm super excited to talk about the build in public. You are one of the experts of build and public. I think I follow you on X. What you do is awesome. We're going to get all into that, but I do want to understand what is this business that you built. Is it a SAS? Is it an app? Could you show me your business real quick and explain how it works? &gt;&gt; So, SuperX is the only tool that helps you grow on X with Twitter the right way. We're the only platform that shows you which posts went viral, why they worked, and then helps you create versions to go viral yourself. We're doing $13,000 a month right now in monthly recurring revenue entirely through $29 a month subscriptions and we have about $450 active subscribers right now. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Super cool business. A lot of people watching the channel want to see that this is a real business that's making over $10,000 a month. Could you show us some of the analytics, Stripe or whatever you look at on a daily basis? &gt;&gt; So, this is our Stripe dashboard. This is our MRR, the majority of it here. The rest is over on Lemon Squeezy. We recently migrated. You can see our net volume since we migrated about a month ago. The majority of our revenue is through subscriptions. So our trial rate right now is around actually about 30%. This is adjusted because we recently migrated over from Stripe. We've got about 60 active trials right now and our churn is close to about 30% as well, but we're trying to get it down right now. Since I started using SuperX properly back in about April, you can see the majority of my impressions have started to skyrocket. And since then, I've been able to keep about 100,000 impressions a day. And this is where 95% of the traffic and most of our users have come from. Since I started posting about 2 and 1/2 years ago, I never in my wildest imaginations expect to get numbers like this. And it's only really happened since I started following the data. Before that, and I was posting randomly, I was getting, as you can see, completely inconsistent impressions. And now we're looking at about 100,000 impressions a day. &gt;&gt; All right, cool. Thank you for sharing all that, Rob, sharing all those metrics, being super transparent about that. I love that. We're going to get all into the build in public thing, but I do have to understand about your background. How do you get into building on X, building apps, and making money with an app online? What's your backstory? &gt;&gt; I went through the traditional route my entire life. I studied hard at school, got a good degree, computer science from a good university, and then I became a software engineer. And that was until my first employer laid me off. And with that, I decided I was done with corporate, and that's what led me to start my journey on X back in early 2023. Over the next two and a half years, I built and launched five products that made in total a whopping zero dollars. And while it sucked, it taught me three fundamental things. Firstly, that distribution matters. Secondly, that monetization matters from day one. And thirdly, that you need to focus on building painkillers, not vitamins. But the biggest thing of all of it was that through sharing the hard times along with the wins, I built trust within our community. I posted every single struggle and failure that I had along the way. And that is what led me to the breakthrough. &gt;&gt; Okay. So the breakthrough you mentioned this is one of the big reasons why I wanted to bring you on the channel Rob is this whole idea of building in public. Obviously you hadn't created the SAS yet. SuperX didn't even exist at this point. What was that breakthrough? Tell me that story. What happened there? &gt;&gt; After I'd had these five failures for me money at that point was becoming this thing that was really really scarce and I was getting really really anxious. I literally hadn't made any money in over a year. So, I made this post and it shared all of my failures and it blew up. It got about 150,000 views on X. And with that came one comment that said I should start a development agency using my skills. So, with the momentum of that initial post, I immediately announced I was starting this development agency and I got my very, very first $3,000 client from that initial viral post. From there, it started to go really really well. The wildest part of all of this was that all of these clients were coming through X inbound to my DMs through my viral posts. I started to post more and more trying to get more and more clients and drive more and more revenue. So, when I started to get these viral posts, everything in my life kind of felt like it was clicking together because I felt like what I'd seen others do in the past on X was finally real and possible. In hindsight, that vulnerability was what made it reach out to so many people because so many people feel this way, too. But I had no process to create this content to drive in these clients. So I built one and soon enough I was using AI data and analytics to systematically create viral content on X. And through that I was making the most money I've ever made in my entire life. And that is when I partnered with Tibo who is the old co-founder of Tweet Hunter to build SuperX. He'd acquired the SuperX Chrome extension and I came on to build the SuperX web app with all of my ideas, merging the analytics and the process to build my dream X growth tool. &gt;&gt; Okay, so you realize the power of build and public. You build this sort of dev agency around it, which is amazing. Most people would probably stop there and be like, "Wow, this is like amazing money and this is awesome. I get to travel the world and do this." But that wasn't enough for you. You wanted to take it to the next level. So, what happened next? &gt;&gt; At the end of 2024, I had a few things going on. So, I had problems with the employee that I had hired. I had a relationship that was breaking down and I realized that actually building products for other people was completely unfulfilling. In January 2025, I made this New Year's resolution where I decided I'm going to start vlogging. That was then when I posted this post that a lot of people now know me for. I shared how filming in public was like, and this was while I was at the airport in Amsterdam flying to Rio de Janeiro. And then when I landed in Rio Janeiro, I opened my phone and this post had over a million views. And all of a sudden, this was like another breakthrough, another viral post. But the scale to which this went viral was beyond my craziest imaginations. And the timing of everything just made sense. I'd started vlogging. I closed down my agency. And this was also when I was starting to build SuperX. But those first seven months in reality were absolutely brutal. I got hospitalized in Guatemala with food poisoning. A few months later, I got hospitalized again in Colombia. And all the time, X kept changing their API all the time. So that was causing stability issues in SuperX. And every day I'd open my inbox and see tens of messages saying that SuperX was down. But I kept building and I kept posting. And I look back at this now and I realized that I was incredibly uncomfortably vulnerable at many, many times. But at the same time, if I wasn't as vulnerable as I have been, I don't think I would have built the audience. I don't think I would have grown my SAS to the numbers that we're doing now. Nowadays with AI, there's so much swap content and people want to follow people. People want to follow stories. It's been this way always. So if you go on X and you share your story, your personality honestly and vulnerably, that is how you build an audience in 2025. So those brutal 7 months led up to the launch in July. I posted this very standard launch post. It had a screen recording of what SuperX does, breakdown of what it does, etc. That got 32,000 views and on top of that it got 26 signups. So I set it down in front of my laptop. I took a selfie. I posted on X and that post got over 46,000 views. I think the funniest thing was that although that post wasn't advertising what SuperX was, that post drove way more signups than the initial launch post did. And thanks to that post, we added $1,000 in monthly recurring revenue in just 24 hours. And I took that as a signal to just keep going. So I started using SuperX to grow SuperX. I used the systematic approach that I built into the product of SuperX to help grow us on X. I'd finally systemized my content strategy. I found what was going viral. It built it. I posted it with my personality. Then I doubled down on the hits and I killed what didn't work. All of it's organically through the strategy that I just talked about. You don't need followers to start. You need consistency, a story line, and a system. Look, this strategy of building a public is not for everyone. But if you're willing to put yourself out there and embrace the cringe, the chances of you building a successful product, I think, are going to be a lot higher. If Rob's story resonates with you, well, I've got something special that I think you should check out. Inside starter story emote, we go over these 17 distribution channels that successful founders are using today. We source all this data from the hundreds of founders that we talked to through the YouTube channel and through starter story. And just one of these 17 distribution channels is building in public. And we have a bunch of modules on how to build in public. And I want to give you all that for free. So, if you click the link in the description right there, you can access our entire build and public modules going over not only Rob's but other build and public strategies that are used by successful founders today in building actual real businesses making real revenue. But this won't be free forever as it's part of the larger starter story remote accelerator. If you've built stuff and you're ready to take it to the next level and focus on distribution and getting attention and building audience and getting customers, then you're definitely going to want to check this out. Just click the link below in the description. But again, it's not going to be free forever. All right, let's get back to the interview. All right. Well, thanks for sharing that, Rob. I think that's amazing. That's one of the real reasons I want to bring you on the channel is that I genuinely think you are one of the best at building in public. I've been following you for a long time. So, I think you have a lot to share and I'd love you to actually share a little bit more and I know a lot of people watching this want to build in public. They want to grow their followers. They know that having an audience is really, really important in this age of AI. So my question to you would be, if you had to start over right now with no audience, zero followers, what would be your step-by-step process to build an audience like you did? &gt;&gt; So step one is set your foundation before you post anything. Set up your profile with these three things. Your profile photo, pick something friendly, smile, but post your actual face and don't change it often because this is what people are going to associate with you. Then your bio. You want one clear sentence explaining what you're doing. And importantly, and this is what a lot of people miss out, is your pinned post. You want your goal or your elevator pitch. So in my case, it was left my job, left my home to live on savings and try and build my dream SAS to 10K a month. You want that pinned at the top of your profile. This step is crucial and this is why it's step one. When people see your content in the feed and they click on it and they go to your profile, they need to instantly understand what it is you're doing, what your story is in order for them to want to go and follow along. Step two is pick your goal and commit to it. What so many people try and do is just post on X, post without intention. You need to pick one specific goal and then document the process of working toward it daily. This gives you consistency because people forget you otherwise because it's the internet. It gives you a storyline because people follow stories, people follow journeys and it gives you authenticity because it gives you the opportunity to through the journey share the ups and the downs and it builds trust like crazy. Step three is the content loop. This is the framework that I use that changed everything for me and it's saying that your content should be four types. entertaining, educational, inspirational, and convincing. So that's like selling your product. But the key is that you don't post them randomly. You post something with intention following this loop. Start with something entertaining. This is the viral post that you're going for. You want to post something funny, something relatable, maybe something vulnerable, the fun tool launch, something like that. This gets you engagement. This gets you warmed up in the algorithm. This gets you the attention. And then you follow up with the educational or the selling. Now that you have the attention, you want to teach something, give some free value, or pitch your product, but importantly from a place of goodwill. So you say, for example, here's how you grow on X D with super X. And then the final part of the loop is to turn it inspirational. So at this point, probably got loads of views, maybe you got a few sales, few followers. Take a screenshot of that, post it. That itself will potentially go viral. But importantly, if you want to have that impact, you want to share what it means to you. For example, this is why I left my job. Moments like this make it worth it. But write it from the heart. You want people to root for your journey authentically. And then once you're at the end of the loop, rinse back to the start and repeat. This loop does three things. It builds trust through authenticity. It educates your audience so that they see the value that you bring and it sells without being annoying. Step four is systemize what works. This is kind of like my secret source if you want to call it that. Don't guess what to post. Use data. Go to successful profiles in your niche. Analyze their top performing post. So I use the superchrome extension for this, but you can use whatever is comfortable. And then identify the concept, most importantly the concept, not the actual post that worked. So you want to take that concept, not word for word, and then make it in your own style. A real example in my case was I used SuperX to analyze what was going viral in my niche. I found a curse for tweets and algorithm simulator were going viral. So I built this features in SuperX. I posted the dancing demo showing them off and this worked. It was combining the proven viral concept with my personality. Step five, double down on what works and kill what doesn't. By this point, you're going to have some signal of what's working and what isn't. So you should be tracking every single post's performance. Then you want to find your patterns. So what format works best for me? In my case, it was video for you. It might be something different. What style of posting resonates? And then what topics engage? So in my case, it was feature releases and authentic moments. Then when you find what works, make more of it. Double down on what works cuz the algorithm rewards consistency. And then importantly, also this is a part that a lot of people forget, kill what doesn't, even if it went viral. So in my case, algorithm simulator went viral, but I killed it from SuperX because it was a feature that most people didn't even use. Step six is build real connections. This is the crux of it all. So far it feels very cold and calculated but at the end of the day you want to be building real connections like you build a real community in real life. I see a lot of my audience and followers as genuine friends and they are genuine friends. I've met up with them as I've been traveling through the world cuz the important thing is that growth isn't just through viral posts. You shouldn't just be chasing virality assuming that you actually want to build something real. You need to build a community through intentional engagement. What most people do wrong is they focus on quantity. So they use AI to spam replies under hundreds of posts, which is a huge problem. On X, they'll say generic comments like, "Ah, so great. Oh, wow. Great post." And at the end of the day, they get no real connections built. But what actually works is you want to find people in your niche, in your community that you genuinely want to connect with and make friends with and then reply with real value. Share your experience, share stories, ask thoughtful questions, and stay consistent with the same people like building any friendship in real life. Show up daily, be yourself, not a robot. And finally, step seven, leverage what the platform wants. Right now, X is pushing video. I don't know what it will be in the future, but video works really well because it keeps people on the platform longer. They're watching your video, so videos get more reach. This does change over time, so you need to pay attention and adapt. For me, when I switched from text to video format, I got 10 times the reach of text posts. But the bottom line of all of this is that unlike what I thought was the case, it isn't about luck. is about building trust through consistent storytelling, systemizing virality through data and analytics, and focusing on building intentional, real friendships. If you do this, you won't need paid ads. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, thank you for sharing that amazing playbook. That is truly amazing, and I really do believe that anybody can build in public. It's not going to happen overnight, but that was really great. So, thanks for sharing that. I realize that we haven't really talked too much about the app that you've built. I think a lot of people watching might be curious about like how does this app even work? Would you be able to give me a little bit of a demo of SuperX and just show me what it does and how it works? &gt;&gt; When you first sign up to SuperX, you land on the inspiration page. This is where we have custom generated daily inspiration. So, none of these posts existed before. They were doing exactly what I said in my playbook. They take what's going viral right now, pulling your context and the concepts of virality and make posts that will go viral for you. The real source of SuperX, of course, is the Chrome extension. So, you can see here I've navigated to my profile. This works on any profile. You can see top posts easily like this. sort them by impression, likes, etc. It gives you real data, insights. I can see the activities on estimate I'm earning through X. And here we can see Pat's as well. So you can see that Pat's put top posts of all time. We got one here, another one here. Um, and we can sort through his tweets really easily. And we can take the viral concepts from these tweets and go and send them into SuperX to help us actually write the content, schedule it. But the feature I am the most excited about is this feature that I just released which is superX engage which helps you step by step reply to posts in your community from people who you're interested and this helps you actually craft those intentional connections that I was talking about. You can reply on the posts in X through superX and you can track your replies all in one place. Okay, thank you for sharing that super cool tool. I'm also curious on a somewhat different note is the tech stack behind this. You built all this yourself. What is your stack for building and then also marketing and how the business runs? &gt;&gt; My philosophy is you pick one stack, learn it deeply and ignore all of the noise because too many people spend way too much time nowadays chasing new technologies instead of just shipping. So my essential stack is for development I use Nex.js, Node.js and Tailwind. For databases I use SQ Lite. We use the X API of course which costs about $2 to $3,000 a month. We use OpenAI and Anthropics Claude Sona API which costs about $1,000 a month. We use AWS for our servers which is about $200 a month. Zillas cloud for vectorized embeddings. This lets us do semantic similarity search on tweets that costs about $200 a month as well. For my personal AI assisted coding, I use claw code that costs about $200 a month. I use Screen Studio for those headbanging demos that go viral. That costs about $10 a month. Then Framer for the landing page, which costs about $10 a month. And Stripe for payments, which of course is free, well excluding fees, and Post Hog for analytics, which I think is free. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Thanks for sharing that. Super cool. The last question that we ask everyone who comes onto the channel if you could go back in time to before you were building in public, maybe even before you had the SAS, what would be your advice to young Rob or your advice for anyone that's watching this that wants to build SAS and build in public like you? &gt;&gt; First thing I would say is breathe. Second I would say is do things with intention, not with emotion. Figure out what you want, cut out all of the noise, and then do an insane amount of volume with intention. Fundamentally, take care of yourself. And if you do all of these things, it's just a matter of time. &gt;&gt; Well, thanks for coming on to the channel, Rob. I think what you did is awesome. Thanks for sharing all the build in public sauce that you have. I think people are going to really enjoy this. If you like this video, if you're watching this, please leave a comment. If you want to see Rob come back on the channel and go deeper into building public, I'd love to have him back on. But thanks for coming on, Rob. &gt;&gt; Appreciate you, Pat. Thank you. &gt;&gt; I want to thank Rob again for coming on to the channel. Look, I know that the whole building in public thing may not be the sexiest growth strategy in the world. I know that a lot of people watching this might be thinking, well, I don't really want to go and share everything about my life online. But if I were to give advice for someone who's just starting out who wants to build something, build stuff online. This is the number one thing that I have people do. Share what you're doing online. Document what you're doing and share your story. In this age of AI where any sort of app or video or AI slop, all this stuff can be created out of thin air. What's the thing that's actually going to last? Well, it's audience. It's distribution. It's real human connection. And for bootstrappers, people who are building side projects, people who are building stuff online, this may be one of the most important videos you ever watch. I love building public. It's something I've done for a really long time. I think this is a really important video and I hope you enjoyed it. If you're ready to build something, check out Starter Story Build. I'll put a link in the description for Starter Story Build where you can come up with your idea, build it, and launch it in just a matter of weeks. And then, of course, focus on the distribution. All right, guys. Thank you guys for watching it. That's it for this episode. I hope you enjoyed it. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: My mobile app made $800K in 365 days
VIDEO ID: LYdJ3dfNCVs
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdJ3dfNCVs
================================================================================

I built probably 10 apps that all failed. &gt;&gt; Louie is a guy from Canada who spent years building apps that went nowhere until one day he decided to try something different. &gt;&gt; Instead of just building another app, I studied Tik Tok. &gt;&gt; Before writing a single line of code, he found a real problem thousands of people were talking about in plain sight. Then he simply started making content about it and the rest is history. Immediately after building, it hit the top of the app store and in just one year it made over $800,000. &gt;&gt; From this video alone, he made 12.5K in sales in one day. &gt;&gt; This story blew my mind. So, I asked Louis to come on to the channel and break down exactly how he did it. In this video, we'll dive into how to find your idea by studying Tik Tok comments, the simple video he created that generated $12,500 in sales, and his step-by-step playbook on how to build apps if you were to start over today. &gt;&gt; I launched this app one year ago as a side project, and it really changed my life. &gt;&gt; This one is a good one. You cannot miss it. I'm Pat Walls, and this is starter story. All right, Louie, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; My name is Louis. I built a makeup app called Glow Up. I launched it a year ago as a side project. It makes around 15K per month right now, and it grew from zero to 100K user in around 3 days and generated a total of 800K in revenue. &gt;&gt; Okay. Before we get into how you came up with the idea for this app, which I think is actually really, really interesting, I do want to understand what this app does. It's a makeup app. Can you explain it? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so Glowup is an app that lets you try makeup looks with AI. And the problem we solve is really to help women find the best makeup look for them without having to go and buy and write on their themselves. It's a mobile app, so iOS and Google Play. We do subscription model, so we do a $9.99 per week. And then you get access to unlimited uh AI makeup looks. So our monthly revenue at the moment is 15,000 per month. We've got our total number of users around 2 million people. We got around 70,000 paying customer. One crazy thing is that we got to number one in lifestyle in the app store and number four in the free mobile apps category. &gt;&gt; Okay. I mean that's insane. You had an app that's top of the app store. Before we get into how you grew this thing and the idea and all that, I want to understand a little bit more about your background. How do you get to the point of building apps and having a top app in the app store? &gt;&gt; I did software engineering for around 2 years and just dropped out cuz they were not teaching the right stuff. And then when I dropped out, I really just worked hard and focused on building mobile apps. My first one did no revenue at all. But I just continued building and building more apps. With that, I created like a portfolio of apps and then started working for startups. Kind of two years later, I kind of came back to building my own apps. And then a year ago, I started working on Glowup and now I'm building other apps and writing philosophy books on the side as well. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, one of the reasons why I want to bring you on the channel is how you found the idea for this. How you found the idea for an app that went almost number one in the app store. Before this you had built a bunch of apps and they got no users. What was different about this app and how you found this idea? &gt;&gt; So my apps before were more for me. I just had an idea and was building them and then once it was finished building I would start marketing but then I would get no views or no users. So we just go to the next ideas and it would be my kind of cycle. But for this one me and my co-founder wanted to create a new app together and we saw that the makeup niche was just super big. So we just kind of started looking at Tik Tok makeup videos and looking at the comment section and with these comments we kind of started doing content around this idea of like getting your makeup look and the products that you need. So we did content first because for most of my other apps before we were just building and building without showing to user what we had and it always failed. This one I really just wanted to be sure that we could market it and it kind of just went viral. So we kind of knew that we had an idea that would work. So I kind of just built the app super quickly, super MVP style and then it took like three days to get to 100K users. So by looking at comment section, you really just feel what people are wanting and you just try to come in and solve whatever they're asking for and I think that is really the way we kind of gather success. &gt;&gt; Okay, so finding ideas through Tik Tok and validating your idea through Tik Tok, then creating the content, then finally launching the app is genius. I also want to dive into the actual creating content side of things. Once you do sort of find that idea after doing research, what would be your playbook if you were starting over from scratch to start a Tik Tok account and start creating content that gets a lot of views? &gt;&gt; So, step one is you're just warming up a Tik Tok account in the USA with a new iPhone. You just buy a USA SIM card. If you're in the US, you're okay, but if you're outside the US, you just put it in and then you buy a VPN that is in the US 24/7. And then you download Tik Tok. You create your account and you start watching videos in your niche. Scroll and like some videos, comment on things for 15 to 30 minutes per day. And it set up your algorithm to think you're not a bot and you're just someone normal. You do that for around 3 days. When you're looking for a niche, it's really good to look at hashtags. So for us, we kind of just look at the biggest hashtags on Tik Tok and makeup was one of the biggest ones. So then we just kind of started looking inside that niche. So really, if you're thinking of a niche, just look at the hashtags of that niche, how many videos are posted, how many views are getting, and this will show you if it's a door that is open for you to start posting content, and get views from it. So step two is just start posting because you've looked at a lot of videos by warming up your account. Try and replicate a trend that works well. Put your app idea on it. And you do that at first, just once a day, and you just wait to get the engagement in. And once you see traction after a couple of days, you can post as much as you can, four to six times a day. And the goal is really to find a trend that is easy to reproduce, faceless if you cannot do video yourself and a way to kind of replicate it lots of times. So you can post on a bunch of accounts and multiple times a day. &gt;&gt; What Louis did in one year is impressive. He basically went from simple MVP to $800,000 in revenue. But when that revenue started coming in, something shifted. He realized that he had a real business on his hand. His app went from a simple side project to a real actual full-blown business. I've been there before. And while it's fun to build and ship, but once you start actually making money, you have to start thinking like a business owner. And that means tracking expenses, managing cash flow, and the dreaded taxes. This is all the stuff that goes on behind the scenes that builders don't think about until it's too late. And this is why we are partnering with Zero on this video. Zero is a cloud-based accounting platform that works for every type of small business. It handles bills and payments all in one place so you can make sure your business runs smoothly. Zero automates your bookkeeping so you can spend time doing what you love, building, shipping, and of course, marketing. And right now, you can get 90% off Zero for 6 months using the first link in the description. But if you want to get that, you got to click that and check it out. Thank you to Zero for partnering with Starter Story on this video. All right, let's get back to the interview. &gt;&gt; So, step three is adding an anchor link. When a video start getting good views, let's say couple of thousand or 100K, you can add a anchor link to the video, which is a download now button. So, the user doesn't have to go to your bio and click on the link. It really just sees the video and sees the link, clicks on it, and it opens up the app store page. Most of our downloads came from our anchor link, and it's really useful. But mostly when the video is going viral, if you put it under a,000 views, it will just kill the video. Step four is just creating other accounts. So you do the same steps again. You can do two to three accounts on the same phone. If you want more, you just buy another phone and you do the same steps. The more video you post, the more money will come in. So at our peak, we had around seven accounts posting 8 to 12 times a day. So that would be my playbook if I was to start again. I've seen that now UGC and influencer as well works very well. It's just it cost a lot. If you have a bunch of money, I would say try UGC, try influencer. If you have no money, start content by yourself. Post Faceless or post UGC with yourself. That would be my playbook. &gt;&gt; Thanks for sharing that playbook. That's amazing. I'd love if you could get even more specific and actually pull up one of your Tik Tok videos that went viral. Show me some of the numbers behind this video and why you think this thing worked and went viral. For this example, we have this video that got us close to 48 million views with 2 million likes. And from this video alone, we made around 12.5K in sales in like one day with 60K downloads. So, this video, I think, went viral because we tried to really pushed our engagement a lot. So what we did is in the comment section you'll see a bunch of people sharing their code or asking for code because in the app we say to the user if you invite three friends you'll get a free makeup look and user would see the video then download the app see that they can share the code and just come back to the video rewatch it and share the code in the comments that really exploded the engagement and we added as well the anchor link around 500k views which made the downloading the app super easy. So the flow was just perfect for user to download the app, try it out, pay for it. If they don't pay, they come back and they engage again with the post which boosted. &gt;&gt; Okay, we haven't really talked much about the actual app that you built. I'd love if you could show off the app, show off the onboarding, show what the app does, and just give us a quick demo. Could you do that? &gt;&gt; So the app is Glow Up. It's just a app that lets you kind of try makeup on. So the onboarding is quite long. The goal is to kind of make the user feel it's personalized. So, a couple of questions about sensitive skin, wrinkles, what makeup look you like, what's your skin tone and these are all used to get the actual results and then we do ask to leave a rating, a review. Usually they leave a fivestar review. Then the reviews gets pretty high in the app store and then you get the results which is you with the makeup. Again, I'm a guy so the the results is not the best but then you get all the products that you can just buy and the makeup routine, how to put it on this kind of app. So, the app is subscription based. So, we do $9.99 per week or $39.99 per year for unlimited makeup look. And that's our only way of making money. &gt;&gt; Thanks for showing that. Let's change topics a little bit. You built this app. What tech stack did you use to build it and what tools run this company? &gt;&gt; So, my favorite tech stack for MVP is Flutterflow. It's a Flutterbased local software that makes development super fast. It's kind of like web flow. You just kind of drag and drop. It's really useful and makes development so much easier. For back end, I use Firebase, Google Cloud Functions. For external APIs with O and database as well. For payment, I use Superwall and for event tracking, I use Mix Panel. &gt;&gt; And on the similar note, what are the costs to run a business like this? And what do the profit margins look like for an app like this? &gt;&gt; Our profit margin are around 90%. It always depends on user usage, but if a user used the app, it means they paid. So, it's kind of good in a way if you pay for softwares, but mostly like back end is like a,000 a month. AI could be 500 bucks a month and marketing could be zero if you're posting or more if you're using a VA or using GC or influencer. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, thanks for sharing that, being transparent about all those numbers. Last question that I have for you that we ask everyone who comes on to the channel. If you could go back in time and stand on young Louis shoulders, give him a piece of advice or for anyone who's watching right now that wants to build apps like you and hit the top of the app store nearly. What would be your advice? &gt;&gt; It would be to move first and adjust later. Never wait for the perfect time because there's no perfect time. Really just take action before you feel ready to learn fast from your mistake but from your success as well. And to just keep building and building. If you stay focused and you grind a lot, one day you'll wake up living the life you once dreamed about. My other piece of advice is that you can have your capitalistic endeavor in whatever niche, you don't have to be an expert. You don't have to know everything. You don't have to love the idea and you still have to come back to your passion. Makeup is like not my passion. I don't know anything about it, but it's my capitalistic endeavor and it's lovely to make money out of it. &gt;&gt; Great advice. Thank you, Louis, for coming on and sharing all this, being super transparent, open about everything you did. I think it's amazing. Congrats on your success and thanks for coming on. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Building a successful app in 2025 is not about your tech stack or what tools you use. The secret, as you're seeing in this video right now, is content. Tik Tok content specifically, and I can prove it. This is the number one thing I've realized after interviewing hundreds of founders on this channel. If you can get this part right, everything else just works. So, knowing this, we decided to put together something special for you. a free course that goes over the five different Tik Tok playbooks behind five successful apps from founders we've interviewed right here on this channel. In each playbook, we'll go over how to find ideas, how to create content, and how to blow up anything that you create. This course is 100% free. So, if you want to grab it and check it out, this is one that you cannot miss. And it will not be free forever. So, if you are ready to get serious about content, Tik Tok, and understand how this thing really works, just click the link in the description to check it out. All right, guys. That's it for this episode. Thank you again for watching and showing up every week. I'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: How I grew my mobile app to $17K per month
VIDEO ID: 8kM-JcKpcDs
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kM-JcKpcDs
================================================================================

Yeah, I literally don't know how to code at all. &gt;&gt; Meet George, a college student who had never written a single line of code in his life. That was until he discovered coding with AI. &gt;&gt; I truly believe that anyone can build a mobile app these days. &gt;&gt; In just a couple months, he came up with an idea, he built it, and then he launched it to the App Store. &gt;&gt; I went from idea to the app store in 1 month. Now, that app that he built generates over $17,000 a month. George is proof that with a little determination, anybody can do this. And I brought him on the channel to show me how he did it. And in this video, we'll talk about his [music] six-step vibe coding process that helped him launch his app, the vibe coding tool he uses to ship his apps quickly, and the marketing playbook he followed to grow his app to over $17,000 a month. All right, this is one that you cannot miss. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. All right, real quick. You are about to hear a crazy story about how George, this college kid, built and launched his app with AI. I think you're going to love this story. And if it inspires you, I also think you should definitely check out Starter Story Build. It is our program where you will learn exactly how to do what George did and what he's going to share with you today. I'll talk a little bit more on that later. So, let's get into the interview. All right, George, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; Yeah, so my name's George Lampropolis. I launched an app that makes 17K per month. I launched within the last 6 months and I'm excited to share how I did it today. &gt;&gt; All right. $17,000 a month with an app in just [music] a few months is insane. What is the app you built and how is it possible that you can make this much money in such a short amount of time? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so Wrestle AI is like an AI wrestling coach. We use um video analysis where you could submit videos of your match and it breaks down what you did right, what you did wrong, and how you could improve. and it gives you drills and actionable plans on how you can actually improve your wrestling. Our pricing is $9.99 for the month and then $59.99 for the year. All right, so this is my revenue dashboard. We launched Wrestle AI September 26th. So I look at our MR MR is 8,000 from monthly subscriptions and then the rest are yearlies, but we acrew a lot of yearlies because we attach the trial to the yearly option. Yeah. So we've done over 2 million impressions on social media. Download-wise, I think we're around 17,000. &gt;&gt; All right. So that's insane that you vibe coded this in the last couple months and you're doing these kind of numbers. Before we get into how you vibe coded it and how you grew it and how you did all the marketing, I got to understand your background. Tell me a little bit more about you and how you even got into building apps. &gt;&gt; So I'm 18 right now. I'm a freshman in college. I've always hated school with like a burning passion and I was always trying my own things, trying ways to make money. And then at 15, I had a decent amount of money saved up for a 15-year-old. And I told my friend, I go, "Let's go all in. let's make this [music] social self-improvement app. Our app went viral on social media. We had 10K followers waiting for our app. We had to hire like three development agencies. None of them got it right. It took us a year and a half to finally release the app. And at that point, the hype died and we lost just [music] all our money. I had to pick up a job at TJ Maxx to get some money. And I think that that was the catalyst of my obsession [music] with startups cuz I always walked around with like a chip on my shoulder that I was kind of meant to succeed. And when I saw that my brains won't work, I was like, "All right, I just have to be absolutely relentless on how I attack, like [music] creating things and starting things, and I just got to keep going until something eventually does work." &gt;&gt; All right. You shared earlier that you tried to work with developers before and build stuff. Didn't really necessarily work out super well. But now, as I understand, you vibecoded this entire thing, and you didn't have a crazy background in development or engineering. Tell me a little bit more about that. Did you actually vibe code this app yourself? Yeah. So, this all started uh six months ago around in June. I was scrolling on social media. I saw an ad for a vibe coding platform called Foror and it said I built seven apps in a week and I go that can't be true and I decided to try it out. I don't know how to code at all but I do understand the systems and how to get conversions from these apps and how to build kind of viral ideas. So, I used Roric for whoever doesn't know is a vibe coding platform and I also leveraged a bunch of public APIs out there to build some of the functionality. It took me around a month [music] from the idea to being live on the app store. From June to July 1st, that's when I launched. And in that month, it was [music] just a bunch of attempts with chatbt and ROR to build something that kind of works. Basically, I would try to port the app from ROR to test flight. And it there was just a bunch of issues. [music] So, anytime there was an issue with Expo, I would just copy the logs, throw the logs into Chat GBT. And I kind of had chatbt as my adviser and it kind of guided me through this [music] whole process. Now I had to hire out one developer to integrate payments [music] and uh authentication. I spent the first week of June on ROR prompting non-stop until I got something that I like. From there, I passed it on to the developer. If you need something simple as integrating a payw wall, that's a super easy task. So I paid someone on Fiverr like 250 bucks. That took him about a week. And then the last two weeks were just spent dealing with Apple's nonsense and rejections. &gt;&gt; George is proof that vibe coding actually works. I don't know how else I can prove it to you guys, but the best part about this is that we are still so early in this whole vibe coding thing. I truly believe that learning to build with AI is the skill of the next decade. And this is why I think you should check program where we will teach you how to use AI to build anything. You'll learn how to find an idea, build it quickly, and ship it in just a couple weeks. If you want to get in on this and actually build something, I'm going to put a link in the description to our iOS boot camp. In that boot camp, you will learn how to do basically everything George did in just a couple weeks. Our next cohort is starting soon, so just head to that link in the description if you want to enroll. All right, let's get back to the story. The next question that I have for you is if you were to start over today, obviously you did this in the last couple months, but a lot of people are going to be watching this thinking, how can I do this right now in 2025, in 2026, if you had to start over, what would be your step-by-step process for creating a somewhat viral app like you did if you were to start over? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, step one obviously is the idea that I think that's one of the most important parts along with distribution. A lot there's a lot of talk now that distribution is the most important part. I kind of push back against that because if you don't have a viral idea in nature, distribution doesn't matter. So, in my opinion, there are three pillars for a good idea. Uniqueness, helpfulness, and the gotcha moment. You need uniqueness so it catches eyes. You need helpfulness so it has some stickiness. And you need that gotcha moment that's built into the app that easily conveys what your app does in about 5 seconds. The gotcha moment is the moment that's going to stop someone from scrolling. Think, I need to try this app out. That idea, the gotcha moment would be in the back of my head whenever I'm designing apps. I go, what could be something that I could seamlessly integrate into a [music] Tik Tok, YouTube short, whatever that will get someone to stop scrolling. Right around the time I launched Wrestle AI, I launched another app in collaboration with an influencer that had a million followers. This app, however, was not a novel idea like Wrestle AI. It was a concept similar to like RGBT and Plug AI. Both Wrestle AI and this app got around over a million close to 2 million impressions at the time. Except Wrestle AI was getting conversions, getting downloads, and doing really well. While this app, Green, that I launched got, I think, 100 downloads off like 1.8 million impressions solely because this app didn't follow like the purple cow philosophy. It wasn't something that was abstract and eye-catching. So now going into the future, any app I build, it needs to be novel. It needs to be something that hasn't been seen before or else your creatives won't convert as well. So step two is designing the app. So you need to answer the question, who is it for? What type of UI would fit the prospective buyer? And then you need to build out the framework first and then the functionality. So I'm literally answering these questions. Who's it for? And what type of UI would fit them? And I'm taking that answer and literally just giving it to RO. And you also need to have in the back of your head, how could users organically share your app? This way, it's not just all ad spend pushing your traffic. Step three, building out the core functionality. So, whenever I'm starting a new app, I set aside a week to literally just sit [music] at my computer and prompt ROR from morning till night. During this time, you're going to have to figure out how Superbase works, if you want to implement APIs or not. ROR does offer a ton of APIs a part of their [music] toolkit as well. But, if you want to add external APIs like a nutrition database, if you're building out a calorie tracker, there's there's just so many things out there that don't cost much money. and will make your app 10,000 [music] times better. So, I highly recommend being on the lookout for some good APIs that you can integrate into your app. So, step four, onboarding. This is the second most important part of your app. You can have a great app, but if you can't convert the user, no one will know. The onboarding by nature is designed to convey what value you're giving to the user. So, the key to making a good onboarding is copying what already works. I would spend hours just studying other people's onboarding processes and applying the things I saw in their apps to my app. Some great onboarding processes are Opel, Cali, just look up whatever apps that are high converting. Copy their onboarding and apply the same elements to your onboarding. If I had to summarize the formula for my onboarding process, it would be first to educate the user about what the app does. Second, personalize the experience with guiding questions that both set up the app for them and guides them to why they need the app. And then I would try to enact FOMO of them not having the app. And lastly [music] is showing them the gotcha moment. Like having them do the gotcha moment but not giving the results before the pay wall. So the length of the onboarding process also contributes to how many people convert. Although it does add friction, it also makes the people who go through it have the sunken cost fallacy which causes users to at least get the free trial. Step five, hire out what you don't know how to do. The greatest return I on investment that I've had during this whole process was probably hiring my developer from Pakistan. A good hire can really change your trajectory. I got really lucky to be honest with finding good talent early on in the process. I think a big key thing to do is sell like whoever you're working with on your vision and they will work really hard to kind of get you there cuz they feel like they're a part of something bigger. And another thing is I think AI now is the great equalizer of education with tools like chat GBT. If you can hire someone that's relatively smart and they know how to utilize AI to learn, not just code, they'll probably be able to f fulfill 90% of your needs. If you're going to hire someone, have them work on a small task that you think they can do. If they excel at it, then start giving them more responsibility. Step six, this is kind of where I'm at now, and it's expanding past vibe coding. So, vibe coding is great to release quickly and validate ideas by building on an MVP, but once you start moving past 5K a month, you should start investing in product quality. Now, I have contracted designers and I have some people that work for us. Another thing is probably discipline as you start getting these bigger numbers. I actually haven't taken a penny out of this business yet. And I'm not going to take a penny out of this business until we're at 100K MRR. Yeah. So, that that would probably be my whole process. And now I'm currently in step six kind of building out past vibe coding. And I'm just really excited for the future. &gt;&gt; Thank you for sharing that. That's amazing. And it's absolutely insane that you vibe coded this in the last few months. I know a lot of people watching this are saying right now, okay, that's cool. You built it, but building doesn't matter anymore. It's all about distribution. So, let's talk about it. How did you market your apps and how do you think about marketing your apps and getting users and making revenue? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, my whole strategy when it comes to marketing these apps, it's all been from influencers. Just influencer marketing, quick snapping, the gotcha moment, just kind of keep going and scaling that up. I think influencer marketing is so valuable. So much that my co-founder is actually one of the biggest people in the wrestling influencing space. So we launched with him. He was a great first push for us when we released we we set up a pre-order to be on the top charts. So the day we released we were like 18 on the app store just from his influence. And then going into month two that's when we began to kind of saturate his audience which you always have to be wary of. From there, I took about 500 bucks and I'm like, "All right, now that we've saturated Kaden's audience, and we're a little bit known in the wrestling industry." We took the money, threw it into marketing, and generated so far. Now, we're at like 13K for this month. I'm probably going to have to invest another 250 before the month ends. But influencer marketing has just been great for us. &gt;&gt; All right. So, I mean, what I'm hearing from you is influencer marketing is huge for you. Your app maybe wouldn't be where it is if you didn't focus so much on influencer marketing. And I have a lot of questions about that. What would be your playbook if you were starting over today? What would be your step-by-step process to find and land influencers so that your app can generate revenue? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I'll break it down in a few steps. Um, step one, if you're just starting out, DM 100 people a day. Step two, the first words of your DM should be paid promo and then like question mark or paid promo for your company, etc. Influencers get hundreds to thousands of DMs a day. They will skip your DM if your first two words aren't something that's captivating to them. So, what's more captivating than basically I will pay you. Step three, when starting out, I would bot your personal Instagram account with followers and then pay to verify your account to establish more credibility. Once you start doing a few influencers deals, that's when I would switch from your personal account to your business account cuz then people will recognize [music] your business account more. Step four, stop wasting your time DMing with them. I think this is one of the most important parts to getting a profitable deal. Negotiating is 1,000 times easier when you're on the phone with someone and they can feel kind of your presence and your voice. So once they respond, text them your phone number and just say, "Hey, let's hop on a call soon." Sometimes they'll call you literally in that moment. Other times they'll be like, "Hey, when are you available?" Or, "I'm busy today." If they say, "I'm busy today. What's your offer?" And they're trying to kind of hard close you. Don't fall for it. Just say, "Okay, just hit me up when you're not busy." They're going to want your money. You're paying them. It's not the other way around. Step five, closing the deal. The best deals you can make are 20 to 50% upfront for four to five videos with a view guarantee that's based on a $2 to $5 CPM. CPM is the cost per,000 views. So, when you scroll on your Instagram and you see that they average, let's say, 25,000 views per video, you're going to make them an offer for videos for 225 bucks. Then, you're going to tell them, but you need to have a a minimum view guarantee of 100K views. Now, if you don't hit that guarantee, you could keep posting until you do, and then we'll pay you the [music] rest of the money. And we would probably pay from anywhere from 50 bucks to 100 bucks up front. I would hire a VA. There's two stages I would hire a VA. When you're just getting started, and then when you're hyper successful, so people like Cali, they need a DM cuz the founder is not going to be DMing these people. When you're just getting started, you need to DM so many people to get your foot in the door. So, you might as well just pay the cheap amount of money it is to pay someone overseas to massively [music] DM a bunch of people. in the middle kind of where I am now. I do all that myself because once your brand is established, your response rate is going to shoot up. So now that our brand is kind of known, I DM off the business account. I scroll for 20 minutes a day. Our for you pages cater [music] to the wrestling niche, message as many people as I can in that 20 minutes. And then the next day, let's say I would hop on the phone with all of them and close the deals. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Influencers. I mean, that's pretty amazing what you've done and that's a great playbook. We haven't really talked much about the app that you built. What I think is super cool about it is this like really kind of niche space, wrestling. I don't really know a whole lot about the wrestling world. So, I thought it would be cool if you could just show us your app, how it works, and maybe like how the business model is. Could could you show us? &gt;&gt; So, here's our gotcha moment. This is the most important part of the app. It's where you enter the video of your wrestling match, fill out a little bit of of information, and then you analyze the video. It then'll [music] scrape the video for the two wrestlers in the video. You have to pick who you are, and then it'll give you a performance breakdown out of 10. It'll give you key observations, stuff you did well, your strengths, your areas for improvement. It'll give you a little like breakdown of your strategy, and it'll give you drills to improve your actual wrestling that you can add to your training program in the app. So, after that, we have a calorie tracker. We just revamped this thing, too. It has a nutrition database. It has a barcode scanner. The It has like that Cali type feature where you can take a picture of your food and it estimates the [music] calories. I love this because it almost has the exact same stuff as My Fitness Pal and it's half the price for their premium. Then we have practice mode. Here it's live coaching and the coach basically explains how to do each move. It'll give you like a little tutorial. &gt;&gt; Here are the steps. &gt;&gt; After it'll basically ask you, here's how to do the move and you'll take a video of you doing the move and it'll tell you what you did right and what you did wrong. You also have your training programs and stuff like that. You also have a calendar to track your next matches. You have a weight journal. The whole idea behind this app was basically creating an ecosystem for wrestling. &gt;&gt; All right, cool. Thanks for showing that. That's super cool. Has a lot of cool features. I want to change topics a little bit and talk about tech stack. How did you build this app and what tools do you use on a day-to-day basis to make it run? &gt;&gt; I know we mentioned this before, but by far the number one tool for vibe coding apps is Ror Bolt, the Vibe Code app, Replet. In my opinion, none of them come close to how good ROR is. And I launched my first app with the $25 a month subscription. I didn't even have to upgrade to their more premium subscriptions. Superbase is really easy to use as well. That's what I use for my backend and it's around 30 bucks a month. AI inference costs, we use OpenAI. It's super cheap. I'm paying 40 to 60 bucks a month. Chat GBT premium. Now, I don't use this in the actual tech in the app, but if you're not paying for chatbt premium, you're behind. I think it's just the most valuable tool for 20 bucks a month is insane. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, thanks for sharing that. Last question that we ask everyone who comes on Starter Story, if you could go back in time to before you had the successful app, maybe after you kind of failed a few times when you were a little bit younger, what would be your advice to young George or for anyone watching this that wants to build apps quickly like you? What would be your number one piece of advice? &gt;&gt; Don't complain about having too much on your plate when you prayed to eat. Back when we were first launching Wrestle AI, we were hyping up the launch. We had about 3,000 pre-orders, maybe 4,000. the app goes live at 12:00 a.m. Right before this at around 11:30, the API we were using for the AI was completely [music] down. So, I freaked out cuz our app entirely relied on this. Not only is it broken, not only is everyone going to subscribe and refund and I felt just so defeated in in that moment, probably one of the most defeated I've ever felt. I was up the entire night working on this trying to figure out a solution. The API gets fixed at around 5:00 a.m. I click launch. I go to sleep. I wake up at like 100 pm and we're number 19 on the app store and we've made over a thousand bucks. We're flooded with comments on like our Instagram page of, yo, this app's so cool, blah blah blah. It was just it was awesome. It was that was a great day. But existence is a pleasure and the hard part is the fun part. You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; That's beautiful. Well, congrats, George, on everything you've done. I mean, doing this in just a few months and having a really successful app that hits high on the app store charts is insane. So, thanks for coming on. Thanks for sharing all that. Thanks for being transparent, showing all your numbers. I think this is going to inspire a lot of people. So, thanks for coming on. &gt;&gt; Thank you for having me. &gt;&gt; I feel fired up after listening to George. [laughter] What a legend, man. &gt;&gt; But yeah, that was that was a really awesome interview and uh it was just so fun to hear like like you said at the beginning, like his determination to build this thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, there's a lot of doubters online. I'm sure they're going to be in the comments talking about how this is impossible or he has some sort of special help or savings or whatever. But when I see someone like George who he's 18 years old, he's currently in college. He's doing this in his dorm room. What more proof do you need that this vibe coding thing is is huge. This is this is absolutely huge. And I hope that watching stories like George shows you that that anybody can do this, right? And as you said, determination like he it wasn't that it was easy. Hopefully nothing in this video talks about it being easy, but as he kind of said, AI is the ultimate equalizer, right? any answer you need you can get from AI and you can build stuff with AI. I don't know what do you think? &gt;&gt; Yeah, my big takeway is like anything is possible to build now with AI whether it's Ror like you said or cloud code or cursor whatever the whatever tool is out there you could do like baseball AI or like pickle ball AI or you know whatever insert niche thing I've shared in on our build channel like my mobile app building process and so I'm like oh this is maybe I'll maybe I'll check out work maybe I'll check out something else. It kind of doesn't matter. It's just like, like I said, it gets me fired up to like go build some stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Fires me up, too. If you are also fired up like Gus and I am, you should definitely check out Starter Story Build. It will help guide you through the process of finding an idea, building it, launching it to real actual customers, getting feedback, and building. Look, it's not going to be easy, but the process is straightforward with a little bit of determination. I'll put a link in the description to our next iOS boot camp, which specifically, if you want to launch an app to the App Store, it's going to be exactly how to do that. You're going to do it alongside other people. We're building cool stuff. That's it for this episode. I hope you guys enjoyed it. Thank you for watching. Let us know in the comments what you thought, what kind of questions you have, or anything else. Thank you guys for watching. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: I shipped my app in 12 hours and now it makes $15K/month
VIDEO ID: k2jecxFu2as

================================================================================

I'm a part-time indie hacker and I built the MVP of my app in just 12 hours. &gt;&gt; Meet Lewis, a dude from India who spent his nights and weekends building projects. [music] But after failing with 15 of them, he decided he would try something different. &gt;&gt; I started building at noon and I wanted [music] to know if I could take an idea all the way to revenue before midnight. &gt;&gt; He shipped his next app in under 12 [music] hours, posted about it online, and to his surprise, it worked. All I did was just build. And &gt;&gt; that app now makes $15,000 a month. &gt;&gt; When I got my 20th paying customer, I knew I was on to something. &gt;&gt; Most people waste years building an MVP that nobody ever sees. But this story proves that you can build something successful in less than a day. &gt;&gt; It's never been easier or cheaper to build a product on. &gt;&gt; So, I asked Lewis to come on to the channel to break down [music] exactly how he did it. And in this video, we'll dive into exactly how he shipped his app in 12 hours with zero coding skills, why failing with 15 products was actually a secret to his success, [music] and his exact playbook for designing, building, and shipping fast if [music] he had to start over today. All right, let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. All right, guys. Real quick before we get into the interview, I think this story is amazing because he built this whole app in a weekend. We're going to get into all that, but I do want to show you 100 more ideas that you, yes, you can go build this weekend right now. I put a link right down there in the description for you to download it. Okay, let's jump into the interview. All right, Lewis, welcome to Starter Story. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; My name is Lewis. I'm a solo part-time indie hacker and I built Audio Pen in about 12 hours. It currently makes about 15,000 a month. &gt;&gt; Okay, you built it in 12 hours. That's crazy. We're going to get all into that, but first I want to understand what is Audio Pen? Is it an app? SAS? What is it? &gt;&gt; APEN's a B2C SAS product. It's a voicetoext AI tool that lets you go from fuzzy thought to clear text very [music] very fast. It listens to you and then transcribes what you say. It then takes that transcription and transforms it into a writing style of your choice. It works across languages. It works on mobile. It works on desktop as well. Some folks use it just to capture ideas on the go. People use it to capture meeting notes. They use it to combat writer's block. And Audio Pen currently has about 200,000 users with over 5,000 paying customers. So, there's a free version that gives users a taste of the product. And then there's a paid version. I currently sell the paid version at $99 a year or $159 for 2 years. Both are non-recurring subscriptions that users have full control over and can choose to renew at the end of their term. &gt;&gt; Okay, before we get into how you built this in 12 hours, I want to understand a little bit more about your background. How do you even get to this point? &gt;&gt; I have a full-time job where I work with my family business in the offline world. So, a completely different side of my life. And I dabbled in the no code space back in 2015 when the tools were very early and not as powerful as they are today. But in 2021 while working with a family business, I decided to get back into the internet world and um I discovered bubble. I built a bunch of tools of probably 15 to 20 tools most of which I failed and audio pen was the first one that succeeded and made a decent amount of revenue to bring me to a place where I can rely on it today as a solid source of secondary income. &gt;&gt; Okay, so let's let's dive into that for a second. You built this product in half a day. No, it didn't make $15,000 a month overnight, but the core product, the core MVP was built in about 12 hours. Can you break down for me how that was even possible and how you did it? Back in 20122, I started a hackathon online called Halfday Build in the build- in public space on Twitter where a bunch of us from all over the world would come together one Sunday, join a Slack channel or a Discord and decide to build products independently with a goal of going from idea to MVP and revenue within 12 hours. So, we'd all start at noon and we'd try to get to at least a dollar by midnight. I was getting frustrated with the number of products I had built in the past and with the low success rate that I had. So, I decided one day to just build a bunch of tiny tools on my own personal website and host them on the homepage there. I built I think four or five tools that week. While I was building it, I just kept sharing them on Twitter. And Audio Pens MVP was one of those five tools that I built. It got a lot more love than I expected it to get on Twitter. So, I figured, you know what, I'm getting some signal here. Some people seem to find this weird product that I've built useful. So I said, "What the hell? Let me just build a full version of it, put a price tag on it, and see what happens." [music] And I definitely think there was a large portion of luck. In fact, one of the principles I try to go by is very often you will not know what will work. And the cost of experimentation is so low today that you might as well build a bunch of things and see what sticks and then double down on them. So you could say that I was lucky because audio pen clicked, but I had also built, you know, 15 or 20 things before that. So, I was bound to get lucky at some point. &gt;&gt; Louis story is amazing, right? Shipped in 12 hours, customers on day one, and now he's making over $15,000 [music] a month. But here's something he had to figure out once the revenue started coming in. The actual business side of things, invoicing customers, tracking expenses, [music] managing cash flow, all the stuff that has nothing to do with building your product, but is very important. Well, that's exactly why we are excited to partner with Zero on this video. Zero is a cloud-based accounting platform for small businesses like yours. [music] It handles your invoicing, bills, payments, all in one place so you can get paid faster and stop worrying about messy spreadsheets. Millions of businesses around the world use Zero because it actually automates the bookkeeping side of things so you can focus on what matters most, building and shipping. And right now, you can get 90% off Zero for 6 months by using the link right down there in the description. So, if you're building something and you want to focus on shipping instead of bookkeeping, check out Zero at the link in the description. Thank you to Zero for partnering with us on this video. All right, let's get back into the interview. Okay, so you kind of post a bunch of different tools. One of them is clearly getting validation and you said, "Okay, I'm going to take it to the next level. How do you actually build it, launch it, and monetize it and [music] then grow it to 15K per month?" &gt;&gt; The first thing was I got signal from people. I DM' them. I was like, "Okay, why do you like this thing?" A few people explained to me what their use cases were. I figured out, okay, fine, I can design something for these use cases. Step number two was just sitting down in Figma and designing. Prior to the 12 hours, I went to Pinterest. I got inspiration. I figured out what I wanted the app to look like. And then by the end of the hackathon, maybe about 10 hours in, I launched a wait list for people so they could sign up in advance before the tool was ready. Got a bunch of people to sign up for it. Before the 12 hours was up, I started getting a bunch of Stripe notifications from the early beta testers that had just signed up for the product. And that was pretty wild to see. was totally unexpected cuz I hadn't asked them to pay for it. I had just asked them to test the product. They already had access to everything that was on offer. And if I were to think about why that worked at that point, I think there were a few things that came together well for me. One was, of course, the product was hitting a need that I didn't know people had. Secondly was I had a certain level of credibility on Twitter because I had been out there building in public for a few months or maybe a few years at that point. I also [music] think I managed to build enough hype prior to this product before I even built the product. And lastly, I think I had other people that were cheering me on as a part of this halfday build community, which also really helps because people like to see other people that trust you before they make a purchase decision. &gt;&gt; Okay, I mean this is an amazing story and I think a lot of people watching this are wondering how can I also build apps fast like this. So if you were to start over today knowing what you know about how to build quickly and validate ideas quickly, what would be your playbook or framework for starting over? &gt;&gt; I think step one for me would still be what I did back then, which is just build a bunch of stuff. Test ideas just for fun. So build small things that you can shut down without any negative consequences to the users. Step two, I would say design something before you build it. I know it's very easy today to just prompt an AI tool and tell them to just build a product. But it's very difficult to figure out what design will work and design today differentiates a product and it takes way longer than you expect. So figure out exactly what you want thing to look like, why you want it to look like that and then share those designs with the world if you can. So like step three would be build in public. Tell people what you're building. Tell them what it'll look like. See what they like about it. See what they don't like about it. Perhaps if you're seeing a lot of people resonate with what you've built, spin up a quick email list. even if it's just a simple Google form. And then step four for me would be just launch the simplest version of your product. Try your best to launch a product that doesn't look amazing if at all, but does the job that it is expected to do very well and then keep raising the price as you refine the product, but just [music] launch it as early as you can. My last piece of advice would just be if you're an indie hacker, behave like one. Don't try to sound like a big company. People really appreciate seeing another human that's building something useful. They appreciate your story. They appreciate the effort that you put into crafting a product. And I get complimented regularly by users that one of the reasons why they like audio pen is because they like that they've been part of my journey as a builder for the past couple of years. So leverage that as an indie builder. Don't try to be something that you're not. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, thanks for sharing that playbook. We haven't really talked about it yet, but I'd love to actually see your app, how it [music] works, and what it does. Would you be able to show it off? &gt;&gt; Yep. I mean, it's a pretty simple app. All it has is a big record button in the center of the screen and a bunch of notes on it. And all you do is you just press that big button and you speak for as long as you want. And the app for Prime users allows you about 15 minutes of recording. And when you're done recording, you just press the end recording button. A bunch of styles will show up. A bunch of languages will show up. A rewriting level will also show up. You can select what you want. Get a verbatim transcript if you wish. You can get something that's more concise if you want. And then you just tap on what you want and wait. Give it a couple of seconds and then it'll just give you the finished product. [music] There you can see it. A simple note that you can then share, take whatever you want, um do whatever you want with it. So free users just get a taste of the product. They have a a shorter amount of time that they can [music] record for. Premium users get a whole lot more. They have everything from writing styles to longer recordings to integrations with other apps and a bunch of other features. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. So, I'm sort of wondering right now what a lot of people are watching this wondering is why is your app making $15,000 a month when there's probably a bunch of other tools that can do this and maybe a bunch of those tools maybe don't even make anything. What's special about your app and why do you think it was successful? &gt;&gt; I think one thing that definitely worked for me was that I was very early when I started the app. There weren't these many products of this type, but Audio Pen focuses on doing one thing very well. A lot of the other apps try to do too many things [music] at the same time and end up getting distracted. And that's a problem that I faced. Like I've been very very tempted to expand into adjacent markets just because you know apps there were doing very well but I've consciously stuck to doing the simple stuff well. Um I think that slow consistency is what has worked for me. I think that's so true. Do one thing and do it really really well. I like this idea of pointy features where you have an app that just does one thing and it does it really really well. If you can just focus on that you can do it so good that you differentiate yourself from other apps. I'll put a link in the description right now of our database of micro SASS ideas similar to Audio Pen. You guys can download that for free right now. There's a bunch of ideas in there, including Audio Pen, which is one of our case studies from Starter Story. So, you can check that out and download it if you want. Okay, let's switch topics a little bit. I know you built this by yourself. How do you actually build apps and what do you use? &gt;&gt; I use Bubble um before my web app costs about $130 a month. Zeno for the back end and logic costs about $260. [music] Draft Bit costs about 300 a year. Um, that's what I build my native app with. Loops, which is my email platform, costs about $800 a month. And Pausible Analytics is surprisingly [music] cheap at $19 a month. The biggest costs are, of course, API costs. It depends on what sort of APIs you decide to use, but that differs from month to month. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well, thanks for sharing that, being transparent about the numbers. Last question that we ask everyone who comes on Starter Story. If you could go back in time and give young Lewis advice on what not to do or what to do, what would be your number one piece of advice? &gt;&gt; Just build many things for fun because you will have fun while building those things. You will learn a lot of stuff while building each product. Most of them will fail. It happens to all of us. The moment one looks like it's not failing and it seems to be resonating with someone, double down on it. Eventually, something will click and all your failures will be forgotten by the rest of the world. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, have fun. That's great advice. Thanks for coming on, Lewis, and sharing everything about [music] your business. I think what you built is awesome. The fact you did it in 12 hours is amazing. So, thank you for sharing. Thanks for coming on. &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me. &gt;&gt; If you made it this far, I'm assuming you are ready [music] to build. So, I want to give you a special gift, which is a discount to our next starter story boot camp. Just use the code [music] ready to build. That's ready, the number two, and build. You can plug that into Starter Story Build and get your special offer. All right, guys. I'll see you in the next one.

TITLE: I Built 4 SaaS Apps to $100K MRR: Here's My Exact Playbook
VIDEO ID: xeUhKuJbeWQ
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeUhKuJbeWQ
================================================================================

This is everything I know about building a successful SAS. This is Tibo, a dude from France I've been following for a while who's launched dozens of products online. But recently, I noticed that he's been on an absolute tear. &gt;&gt; Over the last four years, I've built four apps which passed over 100K per month. Not just one app. Tibo has four separate SAS products doing over $100,000 MR each, which is unheard of. So, I gave him a call and asked him how this is even possible and he shared everything. &gt;&gt; I failed for 5 years because I didn't know this. &gt;&gt; In this video, Tibo and I walk through his specific playbook he uses over and over again to launch successful SAS companies, including [music] the number one thing builders get wrong about validating their ideas, why he's building six different apps versus just one, and his exact 12step playbook he uses for all of his apps. This is a video you cannot miss. So, let's dive in. I'm Bat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, TBO the legend is in the house. Tell me about who you are, Tibo, what you built and what's your story. &gt;&gt; I'm Tibo. Some people know me because I built and exceeded [music] the Tweet Hunter and Tapio. It was an 8 million [music] acquisition. I'm building five apps right now, trying to slowly grow them to 10 million in annual revenue. I've built many apps, so I'm going to be talking about my playbook, the one that I'm using every day, uh, and which got me to have four apps above 100K per month. &gt;&gt; Okay. I mean, insane. Five different products doing $700,000 a month is crazy. Can you break down all these five different businesses? What kind of businesses are they? The highest revenue making is a video making software. It's called Revit.ai. It's basically something where you can input a video, input a text, and Revit will try to create an engaging video. I think Revit is my oldest software. It's making something like 400K per month and still growing 10% month over month, which is quite crazy to me. The second one is called Outrank. It might be the fastest growing of all my my products. Uh it just passed 200k per month. It started just as a blog post generator and right now it's slowly becoming an all-in-one SEO SAS to just grow your organic traffic. The next one is Super X. It just passed 13K per month. It's an allin-one SAS to grow an audience on on X. Next one is Postyncer. It's the smallest of all my product. It's making 1.5k per month. It's also social media tool. I love this space. But this one is more made for people who want to be everywhere. You can post on 10 platform. And the last one is the one that I spend the most money on. It's called Feather. It's a blogging tool making about 10K per month. I acquired this for 250K. It takes your notion notion pages and notion contents and put that as a blog on the web. So all that together I think it's generating something like 700k per month. 50k paying uh customers. The total amount of monthly revenue is growing about 20% per month consistently for over 6 months right now. There's just no sign that it's stopping. &gt;&gt; This is crazy. You've built over four successful apps, have done it all very recently in the last couple years. I talked to a lot of people who want to build SAS and they struggle. They struggle to even make a dollar. Yet, you have done this four times in the last couple years and have insane success. I wanted to bring on the channel to share that playbook. You have this whole 12step playbook that I'm really excited for you to go over. But before we get into that, I want to understand what is the meta here. What are you doing differently in terms of building products, building SAS, building things online that nobody else is doing? What are you Tibo doing differently than everybody else online? &gt;&gt; I think there's basically one big thing and hundreds of very small and tiny things. And I think the the one big things is everyone is just breeding new stuff, adding features because they think that it's going to be the thing that people are are expecting. But what they do not do is what's hard for them, which is talking to people. people right now on the market who are able to build software are also the most shy people and I think I'm part of those like I just I'm I'm a developer I want to stay on my cave this entire framework that we're going to talk about I think it's just about that it's just about you need to do the hard things that feel uncomfortable which is talking to people every day and try to understand their true pain to story is awesome and his portfolio of multiple $100,000 per month projects is very impressive. And what I'm even more impressed is the fact that he's been able to do this over and over again. But here's the thing. Tibo isn't just guessing. [music] He's following a specific playbook that we're talking about today. And he's growing his apps at an [music] insane rate. I know a lot of you watching want to figure out how to crack growth just like Tibo. That's why I'm excited to share a free resource from HubSpot for startups that I think you're going to really find valuable. It's called the Hyperrowth Startup Index and it gives you a clear look at what the top startups are doing differently right now to grow. Things like how they're using AI to streamline operations, rethink their go to market strategies and scale with small focused teams. It also covers trends like why strategic partnerships [music] are replacing the need for traditional VC funding and how successful exits have changed from 5 years ago. I personally found the case studies in there from Clay, G2, and Goldcast especially valuable. They share the exact moves that help those companies scale fast. So, if you're tired of guessing and want the data behind what actually works, check out the Hyperrowth Startup Index at the first link in the description. I put it right down in there for you to download for free. Thank you again to HubSpot for Startups for sponsoring this video. Let's get back to the story. What I'm really excited to have you come on and share. Tibo is your playbook for starting a SAS. If you were to start over today, you have this awesome 12step playbook on how to think about building SAS online. I would love if you could go through this whole playbook for me and for everyone watching right now. &gt;&gt; The first step that I need you to do is find a way to build your MVP in days or weeks. What I mean by that is take shortcuts and you can find like multiple shortcuts today. It's can be using no code. I built some MVPs using bubble.io use uh boiler plates. You can definitely skip many things when you code and most of the expert people will not compromise on those things but I think you should. You will have a 90% failure rate. It's the same for me. It's the same for a lot of people that I know. It's very hard to know for sure that you have something that people want. And so if you want to take a year and fail 90% of the time, it might take like 9 years to get something that's worked out. If you find a way to compress that in weeks and you're able to ship a new product every week, you're going to reach success like much much faster. Step two, you have this MVP. What I want you to do is find the five to 10 people that are very relevant to this product that they are your core uh target audience and you find a way to uh reach out to them. It can be through uh a tweets, a subreddits or it can be through email. Why this is important? If your mom is testing your ID, if she finds it relevant or not, [music] there is absolutely no real knowledge that you can gain from that. If the person is not relevant, like there is absolutely no point in listening to this feedback, either positive or negative. Step three, you started reaching out to people. What you need to do from there is build a true relationship with each one of the people you're reaching out to. you end up truly understanding what's the person life is about like what's the pain is about and how you can truly deliver value because you really understand the workflow of the people you really understand like the core pain. Item four uh talk to them every single day. You are looking for recurring usage and so you are looking for how to make people come back every day on your software and by talking to them every day you will [music] understand why they are not coming back or why they are coming back and how you can reproduce that feeling for other customers. One thing that I did which worked very very well for me is until each product is making 10k per month in revenue the support link on each software is directing people to my Twitter DMs [music] and that creates a daily flow of people that comes to me. people feel much much closer from you [music] and it gives you this insane reactivity where if someone tells you about something and you fix it in like 5 to 10 minutes they might be like customers for life. Something that can change [music] the game is step five understand the ultimate goal of the users by understanding how far you can go with helping them achieving their ultimate goal and how much you can help them doing so you can like 10 times or 100 times generate more value to your users. So step six when it comes to building features remember that you need to fix your users problems and not yours. One thing that I'm doing every with pretty much every one of my product is being the user of my own product. [music] And by doing that, I'm 10 times more relevant with understanding the core problem and giving a proper solution. Every single time there is a tiny things to fix, I just fix it and life gets better for both me and the users. When you are able to build that feature in like an hour or two from when people ask it on the tweets, it creates this insane feeling for the guy. He's going to talk about that. He's going to become the first advocate for your product. Step seven, it's about iterating. What you did before, you need to do it again and maintain this constant relationship [music] with users. Something that worked insanely well for me is by being active on socials, I was able to maintain a constant relationship with people and I was seeing every day people asking for new stuff on my software. Step eight, at that step a lot of people are trying to go broad and I think it's it's happening way too soon. What I want you to do with step eight is repeat until they cannot live without your software. If you go broad, like if you focus on acquisition and at the same time have a low retention, you will spend a lot of energy pushing people to your software and 99% of those people are going to flow away directly after trying your software. You need to make sure that your retention is good. You need to make sure that you have stickiness. If you want to build a sustainable business, you want true value delivered to your customer, which translates great stickiness. one amazing way to know if uh you have stickiness or people complaining about something. Most people think that if if you have a user complaining about something, it's usually a bad thing. And I think it's really not the case. Like if if you are a user that takes some of his time to complain about something on your software, it definitely means that he's committed to using your software. Like he wants you to to fix it. So now we just talked about the hardest part, the eight steps until you kind of I don't want to say product market fit, but you have some sort of stickiness. Now it's time to go and think about distribution. So what's the next step there? &gt;&gt; Step nine um basically it's go broad. There are tons of acquisition channel. I think at this step you need to figure out which one are really working to you. To do that you need to go broad like you need to try many many things and see what's actually working. What's basically true right now is like launching on products, uh, launching on socials and talking about your software like building in public is basically free. So doing that is maybe good enough [music] to get to the 1, two, 3k per month that you need to uh to live and to be able to spend a little bit more on your product. In my case, launching on platkins and talk about my software on socials is always the thing that I do until 10k of revenue. Step 10. At one point, a company needs to become a media company. Either you are good with socials or you are good with SEO or you are good with coating. This is what uh step 10 is about. You need to create content. You need to build a pipe or workflow that makes you able to ship content that's going to fuel everything that you do. You need to have something to say [music] about your industry. You need to have testimonials. You need to have case studies of people that are incredibly successful with your software. But you need to have this engine of creating content that going to fuel everything else that you do. Step 11. What you want here is do sustainable things that are able to help you scale much further which in my opinion are SEO ads and affiliation. You can set up once and can scale to crazy high limits. Take ads for example. If you have a working ads with 1k per month of of ad budgets, it's likely that you can go 10k or even 100k by keeping the optimization running on on those ads. It definitely mean that there is something to dictate here. So I think a very nice example of that is [music] outrank. It basically grew from zero to 20k per month by just reading in public. But like past 20k per month, if you want the growth to continue at the same rhythm, you cannot just rely on that. So we worked we we started doing ads. We worked the SEO much further by hiring something dedicated to that and we ramp up the affiliate program trying to make their life super easy with recommending out rank and it worked. Like that's how we grew from 20 to 200. Step 12 is scale that works and kill what doesn't. I know that I I said earlier that you need to go broad and try out all the acquisition channel that are available in the market. It's because acquisition is hard. But in the end, my experience is for each software growth is pretty much about one or two acquisition channels. Those two acquisition channels, I'm going all in on them. Take SEO for example. I know that SEO works very well for posting. Like I know people are asking a lot of question around social media. Once [music] SEO work, you have so much work that you can do which is SEO related. Find new keywords, find new uh queries that people are asking for on each acquisition channel. If they work, there is always a way to double down on them. This is basically my 12step playbook. This is basically what I do with every single one of our products. I think this way I grew four products above 100K per month. Okay, to thank you for sharing that amazing playbook. I do have a question. You have six products and you've probably had a lot of other products that you've tried and currently trying lots of other products to see if they have product market fit. Sometimes I hear people arguing online about if you should just go all in on one product or you should have this sort of portfolio of projects. Clearly, you've gone for the portfolio strategy, but I'm curious why. &gt;&gt; I have a family. I have like a two kids and a wife and um I really want to be able to sustain the family and [music] I think this move is primary driven by fear like I'm scared as hell right now cuz like the the world is moving too fast sometimes I feel I feel lost with [music] the 10 AI news that we have every day. It's pretty much every day that you see some new AI killing startups because it makes them obsolete. So I think this move of creating valuable products is really about being more resilient. If OpenAI release [music] a new feature tomorrow and it kills one of my products which by the way happened when Alon Musk took over X and almost killed Tweet Hunter like while it was making 200k per month. If that happens today and OpenAI kills one of our products, it's not going to be the end of the world. we going to be able to uh sustain the company and [music] my family and that's why I'm I'm moving forward this way. I want to ask you a question that we ask everyone who comes on starter story for that person that's watching this right now or for young Tibo before you had your exit before you had all your businesses what would be your number one piece of advice to make it in this build online world &gt;&gt; your job is to deeply understand the core need of uh your user and to that I just give two advice which is one maintain a constant [music] communication channel with your user it can be social I think it's a great one but this is really up to you talk to your user every day and understand their core situation. And the second one is being the user of my own products helped me becoming an expert on the problem that I'm trying to solve and so I understand much more what I'm trying to do and how to solve my own problem. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you to TBO. I think that's the best advice I heard all year. Thanks for coming on, sharing your playbook. Amazing what you've built. So, thanks for coming on, sharing, being so transparent about everything. &gt;&gt; That was amazing being here. Like thank you so much Pats for having me. &gt;&gt; Thank you to Tibo for coming on to the channel sharing so transparently all those different SAS businesses he's built all six of them that are all really successful. Absolutely insane numbers. I've never seen anything like it. Personally, I think the playbook's amazing. But the biggest piece that he talked about is the need for builders to get out of their shell, to get out of their cave and talk to people. Talk to customers every single day. Be on X and have that direct line of communication with your customers. I really do believe that that is the difference between a lot of people building stuff and not really seeing a lot of success and the people that absolutely crush it like Tibo. And if you're ready to do the same, to get off the sidelines to build something, to launch it, to get it into the hands of customers and talk to them every day, you should definitely check out Starter Story Build. It is our program where you will come up with an idea, build it, launch it, and get it in the hands of customers in just a couple weeks using only AI tools. I'll put a [music] link in the description for you to check that out. Our next cohort is starting this week. All right, guys. That's it for this episode. Thank you for watching. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: I make $120K/year from 3 mobile apps
VIDEO ID: SJOFUBNHYqU

================================================================================

This is Pre. This year, he's already launched three apps that are making over $10,000 a month. We've gone from zero to 120K in the past year. His strategy is simple. Find a personal problem and build an app that solves it. That's it. That's why I think we have top apps in the space of our niches. He's already built three successful apps with a strategy and plans to do it over and over. I asked Pre to come onto the channel to break down his playbook of building a portfolio of hyper niche apps. And he shared everything, including how to find great app ideas, why building multiple apps is way better than building just one, and his step-by-step playbook for how anyone can do the same from scratch [music] right now. If you care about it, ship it. Even crazier, he did this entire interview while walking on a treadmill, which is absolutely insane. This one was fun. Let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, welcome Press to the channel. I see you're on a treadmill right now, which I have no idea why you're doing that, but tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I am on a treadmill. Just got to keep it on brand. We make health and wellness apps, so I figured jump on the pod while walking on a treadmill. I'm Pre and I built the wellness company. We make health and wellness apps. So, I have three apps right now in the app store. Our [music] earliest app was launched 10 months ago and we've gone from zero to 120K ARR in the past year and all focused in health and wellness. &gt;&gt; Cool. So you have three different apps that you've basically launched in the last 10 months. I think that's kind of a cool strategy and we're going to get into the apps that you actually built. But before we do, I want to understand a little bit more about the numbers behind these apps and the numbers behind the business. Our total monthly revenues are 10.4K and these are all subscription based revenue. Total downloads are over 20,000. Most of this is organic from app store and organic search. We have over 1,500 paying subscribers. And right now our freeto paid conversion is around 8% which is around the higher side just because these are niche apps. And our day 30 free to paid retention is 61%. Okay. So can you give me a little breakdown of what these apps do and what niche you're building for all these apps? Our first app that we launched is called Go Polar. It's an app to track your cold plunge and your sauna sessions using your Apple Watch or your iPhone. The next app is called SunSeek. It's an app to help your sleep and circadian rhythm by showing you and telling you when to get sunlight and also helps you get your vitamin D. And then the third app is Posture AI. It helps you correct your poor posture that you likely get from sitting at a desk, mostly targeting desk workers. And then we have a new app coming out, Tempo, which is a health aggregator. kind of collects all of your health wearable data, puts them into a nice interface and allows you to have a companion that guides you through your health, focusing on your one main health goal. Whether that's trying to lose 10 lbs or maybe you want to climb Kilamanjaro, that will help you do that. Our three apps all focus on health and wellness. So, we're very niche, but there's a very large audience overlap. So, we'll have some Go Polar users that are also Sunseek users that are also posture AI users, and hopefully also we'll become Tempo users when we [music] launch that. The reason we target the same audience is because of the overlap. So users of our one product, we don't have to remarket and create a new audience and list to target. We already have that and that exists in our other app. And then when we market to them, it's not marketing cold. They already use our products and it's a new product that is most likely exciting for that user. Okay, cool. I really like that idea of building a portfolio of apps, but not just a bunch of random stuff, but actually all the products serve the same audience, which gives you opportunities to market new apps and products to the same customers. We're going to get all into that, but first before we do, I do have to get into your background. How do you get to this point where you have three successful apps that are making money in the app store? I actually went to college for business. I didn't really know what I wanted to do. But after first year, I quickly realized that school was not for me. And I really just wanted to build things, create things, and get started working. So after first year, I actually dropped out of school. And I didn't have an idea that I wanted to pursue at this time. I knew I wanted to build things. I also knew I wanted to learn. So I sent an email to different entrepreneurs and investors that I had come across on Twitter or podcasts. One of them was an angel investor. Long story short, I get a job. I end up working there for 7 years. So during my time at launch, I got to see all these thousands of founders. I'd be on calls with them. They'd be showing me their products, what they built, how they built it, how they got their first users. And from that point, I learned that I could be doing the same thing. This inspired me to start creating my own products on the side while working at launch before deciding to go full-time on the wellness company. Really learned the ins and outs of what it takes to build a company, ship a product, and through that got the confidence to know that I could be one of these founders and create my own thing and ship it. I always have been building in health and wellness just because that's where I care most deeply about. I grew up with my mom teaching me about meditation and different wellness tools that I could do to feel better and think clearly. And so I knew I always wanted to build in the space. Okay. So you see lots of people building apps. You realize you can do it too. How do you then find the idea for what to work on? How did you decide on what to build for your first app? I personally love to track my activities just to see how they measure up against different metrics that I'm tracking through my wearables. And so I looked at the app store. There wasn't a great app that tracked your specific niche activity like a cold plunge, like a sauna, like a cold shower. And I figured I could build this experience. And so that's the first version of Go Polar, which was just solving a personal need of wanting to track that activity. And there was no great app to do that. And from there, we had new ideas. And now the app is one of our main apps for the wellness company. Okay, cool. What you mentioned there is actually really important. I really like that. Is that this was a personal problem that you experienced. Is this sort of part of your strategy for finding other ideas in your niche or how does that work? That was part of the main idea. If I experienced this pain, I could build a better product than my competitors. Also, I would care more about it. And building apps is hard. Like nothing about it is really, really easy. But if you love what you're building, you'll put in the effort and put in those extra details to craft a better experience. And then that will just compound into getting more downloads, getting more revenue. &gt;&gt; Press didn't just build three apps. He built a real business. Running a business isn't just about selling more. It's about everything that comes with it. When your business takes off, you unlock a new set of problems that can slow you down and even threaten your success. And what I'm talking about right now is [music] sales tax compliance. Thousands of rules change constantly across states and countries [music] and the last thing that you want is your product launch to be interrupted by a letter from the state. Well, that's where Avalara Avatax comes in. Avatax tracks your sales history [music] in real time and alerts you when you're getting close to economic nexus thresholds so [music] you can act before it becomes a problem. No spreadsheets, no frantic searches, and no late night wait are we compliant in Illinois moments. And that's [music] because Avitax maintains more than 900,000 tax rules and 82,000 rates, all updated [music] automatically. It works with the systems you already use with more than 1,400 signed integrations, including Shopify, Netswuite, [music] and QuickBooks. You also get audit ready reports, so small issues don't [music] become big ones. More than 43,000 customers in over 75 countries use Avalara to handle the complex parts of compliance so they can focus on growing their business. With Avalara, you'll protect your time, your focus, and your ability to keep growing. If you're serious about scaling, do not let compliance [music] slow you down. Take a self-guided tour of Avalar Avitex at the first link in the description to see how it works for your business. Thank you to Avalara for sponsoring this video. Let's get back into it. I talked to a lot of people through the channel that want to start stuff, and I always say the same thing is why start something [music] in a space you don't know anything about? you're going to have to spend years learning about that space, learning about the problem, or you can go and build something that you know a lot about and you're going to save a lot of time and build something probably better. So, I think that actually is really smart. I think a lot of people watching this want to do the same. They want to build an app around something that they're passionate about or a space they know about. You've done this and you've done this multiple times. So, my question for you would be, what would be your playbook for doing this from scratch today? Okay, so here's my step-by-step playbook for how I think about this. Step one, you probably have a passion or deep interest in something. Figure out what that passion or deep interest is. So for me, it's always been health and wellness. Just because when I focus on my health, I feel better throughout the day. I have better energy. I sleep better and my life becomes more fulfilling. Step two, once you figured out that passion or interest, what problem do you encounter within that? And the way you find problems actually will come organically to you. If you do the activity naturally, there's always something in the back of your head that could be improved. And you just have to open your mind to paying attention to what that could be. And step three, once you found that problem, now it's time to build the solution. And you want to build this quickly, which means not spending too much time overthinking, overanalyzing what the solution is, but just trying to solve it quickly by building an MVP with a tool like Lovable or Replet or Bolt. Step four, you want to think about distribution on day zero before you even launch. And there's always a creator in your niche. if there isn't. The great thing about solving for a problem that you yourself encounter is that you can create the content. You know exactly why you're building this product. And so just talk about it on these platforms and you'll start to build an audience. And step five, put in the reps. It takes reps to build a really great product. [music] And the faster you can ship, the closer you'll get to that winning product. Most founders and company's first product don't break out, but it's that third, that fourth, that fifth iteration that really builds a great experience. The reason I started the wellness company as a product studio was because I didn't know what that one winner was going to be. I launched Go Polar as one product. Then we launched another one and another one and another one. But I treated each app as a different repetition of building product. The next product after Goar was Sunseek and Sunseek was crafted better than Grow Polar on day one because of those reps that I had taken. And there aren't any shortcuts around this. You have to put in the reps. You have to build the product and you'll just get better over time. So yeah, that would be my five-step process if I were to start over again. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you for sharing that playbook. Now, I want to dive into like actually what you built. I know you have three apps. Could you actually show me those apps and what they do? All right. So, here on the bottom left, we have Go Polar. This is the first app that I launched. I'm going to open up here. You see I have a nice dashboard of my cold activities, my hot activities. You can see the list here of all my cold plunges and sauna activities. And I can go inside an activity and see finer details like my heart rate trend and the water temperature, etc. Next, we have sunseek. This is the [music] morning light exposure and vitamin D app. So you can see right here, this morning I had zero minutes of morning light exposure. And I have a progress bar here showing me the minutes that it's captured. Today it's at zero cuz I didn't go out and get it. I can also see the list of my activities here of the sessions of morning light exposure. And then here we have a fun little lux calculator. If I point this at the sun, I can get a lux measurement here. And that fits into the app and experience as well. And here we have posture AI. So this is our posture correction app. The main feature of it is taking a scan of the user. And so here you see me, but I would put this phone down against the wall and it would scan me and give me a posture scan result. So here I have a poor reading and you can see it highlights areas of improvement here. So I might have a head tilt likely from sitting at a desk too long and it'll give me an analysis and report of how to [music] fix that. And here we have the latest app, Tempo, which we're launching in a few weeks. The idea behind this is it takes all your wearable data and your blood tests, etc., and puts it into a health span score. So you can see I've got a 81 here and I can see what markers are affecting that score and what I might need to improve. I can also chat with my health here since it has all the context of my changing data and my labs. I can get better answers from the AI. So all these apps make us about 120k ARR. All right. Well, cool. Thanks for sharing that. I want to switch topics a little bit and talk about how you built these. What's the tech stack behind all these apps? How do you build apps? We use a bunch of tools inside the wellness company. Figma for all things design. Cloud code and Xcode for our mobile app development. Superbase for backend and database. iMessage for customer support. Keep it easy. Revenue cap for subscriptions and paywall. Sentry for crash logs and error monitoring. Post hog for analytics. Since we have so many different apps, we need to stay organized and linear helps us do that. Chat GPT for just general business thinking and app thinking and feature development. Cap Cut for editing videos. Framer for landing pages. And Lovable for testing MVP ideas before we go out and build the app. Okay, cool. And on that note, what does it cost to run a business like this and what do the margins look like? &gt;&gt; So, the total cost for our tools is about 300 a month and Apple takes their 15% cut if you make under a million dollars. So, our margins still stay close to that 80 85% range. Thanks for sharing that and being transparent about the numbers. The last question that I have for you and that we ask everyone who comes on the channel, a lot of people watching this want to build a bunch of different cool apps in a space that they're passionate about. What advice would you have for anyone watching this that wants to do the same? If you care about it, ship it. Ideas were meant to be shared. If you have any single idea that you think is worth pursuing, it is and you should build a product around it and ship it. And also motivation and energy is fleeting. So when you have that idea, when you have that energy, take the first step to build that thing. And any idea is worth taking that first step if it brings energy to you. Thank you, Pre, for coming on the channel. I love what you built. All these different apps. I'm sure [music] they're going to grow to be huge. Thanks for coming on. Thanks for sharing everything. Thanks, Pat. What I really love about his businesses is that he built apps that solved personal problems for him. He was on a treadmill while he did this. He's clearly passionate about health and wellness. And all of his apps sort of solve problems in that domain. Cold plunges, sunlight therapy. This all works because he's serving the same customer instead of building random apps that all do different things in different categories. Every app he builds gets better and can be sold to this larger group of customers that [music] he has. That I think is the secret to building multiple apps. And his skills prove it. On the same topic of skills, this is why we launched Starter Story Build. In Starter Story Build, we will give you the skills to help you turn your [music] ideas and your passions into real apps using only AI tools. If you're ready to get off the sidelines, launch your project, do it the right way, then head to the first link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. All right, guys, that's it for this episode. Thank you for watching. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: How I Built It: $30K/month Micro-SaaS (Subscribr Breakdown)
VIDEO ID: 7KqlwjBM_tM
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KqlwjBM_tM
================================================================================

My name is Gil and I vipcoded an AI app that makes over $30,000 a month. &gt;&gt; Meet Gil, a developer who built a SAS to $30,000 a month thanks to one simple strategy, &gt;&gt; which was, I think, the the key thing that made this successful. &gt;&gt; Instead of spending months building and then finding customers, Gil took a very different route. &gt;&gt; And I made my first $20,000 before the idea was even built. I brought Gil onto the channel and he shared everything, including how he came up with a $30,000 per month SAS idea in an industry he knew nothing about, how he built up hype for an app that didn't exist, and the playbook for how anyone can do this starting over from scratch right now. This is one that you cannot miss. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. Okay, Gil, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. Thanks for having me, Pat. My name is Gil and I vibe coded an AI app that makes over $30,000 a month. Subscriber is an AI script writing tool for YouTube creators. It was profitable from day one and 18 months later I have over 4,000 customers. We have a SAS subscription model. We have plans anywhere from $49 to $300 a month. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. This business is awesome. Can you give me a little bit more numbers behind the business and how it's doing? The amount of revenue every month varies, but typically it's around $30,000 a month, and that's in subscription revenue. And in total, in the past year, I've done over $700,000 in sales. So, we've got over 4,000 customers today. We acquire those customers through word of mouth, social media, and a big part of that is actually our programmatic SEO campaigns where we bring in over 30,000 views a month just from Google. Before we get into how you built this, how you grew this, I want to get a little bit more on your background. How do you get to the point where you even start a SAS business like this? &gt;&gt; Well, I started my first SAS actually when I was a teenager. I started coding, you know, when I was 15. And by the time I got to college, I was already working out in the field doing, you know, freelance uh software development. And so I actually dropped out of college pretty early and was doing that for several years. After that, uh, I was a victim of Hurricane Katrina. kind of had to start over and so I moved to New York City. I co-founded a company called Squidoo, which was a social publishing platform. We grew that to over $10 million in revenue. After uh Squidoo was acquired, I moved on to consulting for a while. Then I got the itch to start something new, you know, as a startup founder. Got into the cryptocurrency space. Uh there was really no QuickBooks for crypto. There was no accounting solution for businesses that are using crypto. So we dove into that. We were one of the first solutions on the market. We raised millions of dollars from VCs and then we actually ended up selling that company too. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you're in this VC world. You work on and sell multiple companies. How do you decide to go the bootstrap route and how do you come up with an idea that eventually makes $30,000 a month? &gt;&gt; Well, there's nothing wrong with the VC backed route, but after selling that last company, I was really excited for a change. I started posting videos on YouTube talking about my ideas for what kind of company I would want to start next. At the same time, I was getting more into YouTube itself and getting into this idea of faceless YouTube channels where you can create channels on the back end. So, I started putting together a team. I quickly realized that script writing is this huge bottleneck. It's actually really hard to find good script writers even though we sort of know what a good YouTube script looks like. I tried using chat GPT and I saw that it was nowhere near good enough to, you know, write the kind of script that I wanted to see. But I made a bet that if I took all of my experience as an entrepreneur and as a software developer that I could build a solution that actually worked. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well, I think that's super interesting that you actually attempted to build a business in an industry that you really didn't know all that much about. And that's one of the reasons why I wanted to bring you on the channel is you had this interesting strategy on how to validate an idea that maybe you weren't fully deep into. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? &gt;&gt; I did what anyone would do. I signed up for X. I opened up a brand new account uh with zero followers and I started following everyone in the YouTube space. From there I uh you know started finding opportunities to create things of value for people in that space using my skill set as a software engineer. So I started putting together little pieces of content and I would put it out there using viral giveaways on on X and from there I was able to build up an email list of over a thousand people. you know, every week or so, I would just hit hit up this list with new findings that I had and in the background I would reach out to each person individually to talk to them about this idea for this app that I wanted to build. So, I was getting feedback on this idea and when I realized I had something, I knew it was time to monetize it. So, I mocked up this idea and I uh then knew I needed to get validation on it. So, I set up a pre-sale. The pre-sale was 50 licenses of the software that are basically lifetime subscriptions to it and it was at kind of an absurdly low price. I figured if I could sell these that it was validation that this is actually a product that people would want to buy. The first 10 licenses were super super cheap and then every 10 after that went up. So there was a little bit of FOMO for those early adopters. pretty quickly it sold out I think within 2 or 3 days and I made my first $20,000 before the idea was even built. Now there was one catch and that catch is that I told people at any point in time you can ask for your money back. I'm going to deliver this product to you in 60 days and after that you'll have 2 weeks to continue trying it and ask for your money back. So, if I didn't get this right, all that money that I worked for would be lost, and I had 60 days to just put my head down and make the thing happen. &gt;&gt; What I love about Gil's story is that he didn't spend months building something that nobody wanted. He validated demand, got the customers, and then he built the app. I think this mindset is the shift that separates winners from everybody else building stuff right now. If you learn how to harness AI, once you have your idea, you can build it really fast, sometimes in just a couple weeks or even a couple days. And this is exactly what we teach inside Starter Story Build. Inside Starter Story Build, you'll find our boot camp where we will show you how to find an idea, how to build it, and how to launch it all with just AI. We've had thousands of people already go through our programs and launch their first, second, and sometimes even third apps. It is so cool to see these projects come to life and see how AI is helping people do this even faster. Our next boot camp starts this week. So, if you are ready to get off the sidelines and you are ready to build, just head to that first link right down there in the description to check out Starter Story Build and everything we do to help you build and launch your next big thing. All right, let's get back to the video. I think that's really important that you mention there that final catch which you didn't really mention right until the end which is you actually hadn't built the product yet. This is why I wanted to bring on the channel because I think this is so genius. Can you break this down a little bit more about why this works and why you did this? &gt;&gt; The curse of being a software developer is that it's so easy to fall in love with an idea. And I've done this so many times before. Too often we just get excited about that invention without making sure that it's actually like a painkiller. So as an entrepreneur we always want to be selling a painkiller, not a vitamin. A vitamin is a nice to have. A painkiller is something you have to have and it's going to sell a lot better. The traditional advice with startups is to go and talk to your friends and say, "What do you think about this idea? Give me feedback." Maybe the next level of advice would be to say, "How much would you pay for this tool if it existed?" I actually think that that feedback is not good enough. In fact, it's actually quite dangerous because it lets you think you have validation. So, you go in a hole for 3 months or however long it takes to build this thing and then you pop up for air and you say, "Hey guys, it's ready." And the problem with that approach, they say, you know, I would be willing to pay $20 a month if I didn't have this other subscription or I would be willing to pay once I get this check-in from my old company. And I've seen this happen so many times. So, the only way to really get validation is to collect money from people. And the faster you can get to that, the more likely it is that your startup is going to succeed. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's amazing. I think it's one of the best pieces of advice for anybody bootstrapping anything with their own cash. What I really want to get from you, and I think a lot of people watching this would be wondering, if you were to give advice to someone watching right now on how to do that, what would be your exact playbook if you had to start over from scratch today? &gt;&gt; Well, step one is you have to build an audience because if you don't have an audience, you don't have anyone to sell to. People buy because they trust you. And especially today when it's so easy to create products that there's a million products out there. People buy based on believing in a brand or a person. Post the raw, you know, build in public type stories of you with your thought process and what you're doing. And that will help establish trust with people. The way I did that was just by putting out free things of value that took me time to create, but I knew would be helpful to other people. in addition to just showing up and being really authentic about who I was and why I was there. That alone can get you an audience of people that trust you and are engaged with you. And that really is the first step. Step two is you've got to set up an email list and start communicating with people at least once a week. So, while your social media can be a great way to kind of interact with new people, your email list is really where you're building that trust. And what's cool is that when you start emailing people, they will email you back and you start this dialogue and you can start to talk to them about your idea. You can even use your email list to put out your ideas, get the replies back as your feedback on how to improve your idea. Show up, do that weekly because when it's time to hit up that email list in order to, you know, start your pre-sale, you're going to need that level of engagement. So step three is you've got to do the math on what validation would look like for you. In my case, I knew I needed to make about $20,000 to fund, let's say, 3 months of my life in order to work on this thing. And so I worked out how many people I would need based on my target price point of what I thought this type of customer would pay. And that led me to 50 people to buy. And so then I worked out the math of how big does my email list need to be in order to potentially get 50 buyers. And so I thought about conversion rates. You know, it's obviously going to depend. But that gives you a very scientific way of understanding, you know, what kind of audience that you need to build before you're ready to start this pre-sale. Step four is we're ready to do the pre-sale. Now, you've got to get aggressive about this because there's no one who's going to be excited about your product unless you make them excited. So, you've got to set up an email sequence every single day for seven days. Start teasing out the benefits of this product that you're building. And yes, you can talk about features, too, but it's really about the benefits for them. Really get emotional and talk about how this benefit is going to impact their life. And the more that you can do this, the more likely it is that people are going to convert. And towards that last day, really start hitting home this concept of the pre-sale that's launching. Do not give any details away yet. Just give a date. On the launch day, you've got to have several emails queued up so people know exactly when it's going live. You've got to have reminders when the pre-sale is about to end. And you've got to be firing on all cylinders on all of your social media channels. You've got to be really visible during that time. And if you work really, really hard and engage with people, it's an incredible thing when you actually pull off a pre-sale like that. So, a key part of the pre-sale is to have an offer so good that people can't help it but say yes. And if you follow Alex Hormosy's $und00 million offers, he talks about this a ton. For me, for the first 10 customers, might have not even been profitable, but I knew it was something that people would say yes to. I also wanted to give people total security and comfort in their purchase. So, the way that I did that was by offering a money back guarantee. So the entire time in between when the pre-sale happened and when the product was delivered, they could ask for their money back. People had the confidence in knowing that they could get their money back. Especially for someone who's new in the space, they were able to go ahead and make that purchasing decision. So for whatever your product is, think of an offer so good that people can't help but to say yes. &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, that's awesome. Thanks for sharing that. I want to switch topics a little bit to techstack. I understand that you vibecoded this SAS app. Can you share the actual tech stack that you use to build this and what you use to build this app? &gt;&gt; I use cloud code. Probably 90% of my code is written with cloud code. I keep it super simple. I'm using a Laravel app u which is a really excellent PHP framework that's got tons of great support and uh I'm just hosting that on digital ocean. But I would say in general that you know I'm not relying on a ton of external services but besides the AI model providers and it's uh just a pretty chill setup that I've I've really been enjoying. So in terms of the the cost to run the business, the biggest thing is definitely AI compute. Today I'm probably spending about $3,500 a month just on the AI compute and that's coming from a bunch of different model providers. I'm spending about $2,000 a month on ads. And uh I have another $1,500 a month in other things like web scraping, hosting, and sending emails to my users. &gt;&gt; Okay, awesome. Thank you for sharing that, being so transparent about the numbers. The last question that I have for you that we ask all founders who come on to Starter Story, if you could stand on Young Gil's shoulders, when you officially started the Bootstrap business, what would be your advice? And what would be your advice to anyone watching this right now? Well, the first thing is you cannot fall in love with your idea without validating it by doing some sort of pre-sale, validating that people are willing to pay for it. The second thing is as a bootstrapper, the number one thing that you've got to strive for is profit. There are many decisions you could make as money starts to come in that could creep into your profit. Whether that's hiring expensive agencies who promise the world to you or whether that's going off in a completely different product direction, focus on generating profit from your business and then everything else will be good. It's better to have profit than growth. I think if you're in the the bootstrap game, &gt;&gt; I love it. One final question that I want to ask you, one-word answer. You've built VC businesses, you built bootstrap businesses like this. What's more fun? &gt;&gt; Bootstrapping for sure. &gt;&gt; Love it. All right. Thank you, Gil, for coming on. I love the business that you build. Thank you for sharing all this. I think it's an amazing way of approaching building something. So, I hope people enjoying it are watching. Thanks for coming on. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thank you, Pat. &gt;&gt; All right. I want to thank Gil for coming on to the channel and sharing all that. I think what he shared is one of the most important things you can do if you suffer from a little bit of the builder's disease. For some people, coding and building is really, really fun. And the scary part is going out building some audience, getting in front of customers. But unfortunately, that is what you need to do in 2025 if you want to actually build something. This is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build. In Starter Story Build, we will help you take your idea and turn it into a real app using only AI tools in just a couple weeks. Why? Cuz you don't want to focus on the build for too long. It's way more important to be able to build quickly so you can focus on getting customers, building distribution, and making sales. So, if you are ready to get off the sidelines, launch something, build it, get it in front of the real world, then head to the link in the Build. All right, that's it for this episode. Hope you guys enjoyed it. I'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: Our Mobile App Made $85K in 8 months
VIDEO ID: nsn94Ad47GY

================================================================================

My name is Jack Sweeney &gt;&gt; and I'm Nick Sweeney and we're the co-founders of Coherence. We have over 15,000 downloads and around $85,000 in revenue. Meet Jack and Nick Sweeney, two brothers who built a mobile app this year that's already made $85,000. But here's the thing. Instead of building the app first and then trying to market it, they did the exact opposite. Content before product. I didn't actually write a single line of code in this entire codebase. &gt;&gt; And this is why they were successful. So, I brought them onto the channel to break down this entire playbook. And in this video, we'll dive into how they validated their idea before building anything, their five-step framework that anyone can use to find an app idea worth building, and why you need to stop coding and start creating, or else you might never make it. All right, this one's going to be fun. Let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, Jack and Nick Sweeney, two brothers. Welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your guys' story. &gt;&gt; Awesome. Thanks for having us, Pat. My name's Jack Sweeney &gt;&gt; and I'm Nick Sweeney, and we're the co-founders of Coherence, which is an app that helps you regulate your nervous system. We launched eight months ago and we have over 15,000 downloads and around $85,000 in revenue. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Before we get into the app and what you built, I'd love to hear a few more numbers behind it. Can you share some more details about how fast this thing grew? &gt;&gt; Since we launched, we've averaged around $11,000 a month in revenue and our biggest month was $22,000 in revenue. We've just surpassed 2,000 users and we have 15,000 downloads so far. &gt;&gt; Okay. I mean, that's amazing. Before we get into the app, tell me about your background, how you get here, how you build this. &gt;&gt; 100%. My background is in content originally. In university, I had a YouTube channel and grew that to about 20,000 subscribers, but during co I ended up leaving and decided to pursue entrepreneurship. So, I started building some simple web apps with the no code tool. And the first couple apps that I built totally flopped, but just kept iterating and getting better. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And my background is more of an athletic background. So, I was a division 1 crosscountry skier, but I ended up getting injured and the doctor said that my career was over. I wasn't able to walk for 10 months. He said I wouldn't be able to walk normally again. And so, out of desperation, I started doing breath work in earnest. And I was able to walk within 3 months. And then 6 months later, I was training full-time again. And so after that experience of resurrection with breath, I've begun coaching and helping people reverse their chronic conditions. And I wanted to find a way to help us scale the medicine of breath work to reach more people and change more people's lives. &gt;&gt; Okay. Before we get into how you guys built this thing, I am curious building an app with your brother. I'm not sure if we had anyone on the channel yet that are siblings building an app. What's that been like? How did you guys decide to build this? &gt;&gt; It's been an absolute blessing having Nick being able to lean on each other. Like when I was hurt, for example, Nick was still going. When Nick like got sick for a week, I was taking care of things. I'm just super grateful to be able to have a brother to build a business with. &gt;&gt; Okay. The main reason I wanted to bring you guys on this channel is I love your guys's approach to how you built this app. It's very different than what I've seen a lot of people doing. Tell me what you did differently with Coherence. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we didn't really start with the app. We started with content and we were making content about things that genuinely excited us. So, I was writing threads on spiritual esoteric topics. Nick was doing the same with more of a breath work focus. And if we weren't just making that content for fun, we never would have discovered what was going viral and what content was going to work, which ideas actually resonated with people. So, we started with the content first. We made content that we cared about and that's how we learned what was actually resonating. Once we saw what went viral, then we built the app. So, we basically reverse engineered the content into the app. And I would just make posts about those things and see which ones would get traction. So we would use X as sort of this idea battleground. And then when I would get traction on a piece of content on X, then we would see that as a validated piece of content. We would basically have an Instagram short form script from the X post and then we would replicate that on Instagram and Tik Tok. And then if those did well, we would make that a YouTube video. So we were kind of moving upstream to longer more impactful formats of content and that was how we approached it is a content first. Let's validate the content and what people and the market actually wants and then let's build whatever we want to build off of that. &gt;&gt; Okay. I think that's genius to focus on content first. I'd love to understand a little bit more of the timeline here. I'd love to hear a little bit more about &gt;&gt; It all started with the vortex breath. I wrote a tweet and posted it. next morning and it goes, "Yo, your Vortex breath tweet is going super viral." And so that's sort of where we we got the idea for the app. So then we started coding. I didn't actually write a single line of code in this entire codebase, but we use cursor. We finished the MVP February 2025 and launched. So that was the timeline on it. &gt;&gt; So here's what I love about Jack and Nick's story. They coded the first version of their app in just a few weeks. They didn't waste time overthinking or overplanning. And I wanted to mention this because I do see this happening a lot. People getting stuck in the build phase for months. Well, that's where Rocket new comes in. Rocket lets you go from typing a few sentences to a full stack app. Just describe your vision once and you'll get a complete functional app with backend integrations and production ready code. You can even import designs from Figma, add integrations like Stripe and Superbase, and download an actual mobile APK to test on your phone instantly. Over 400,000 users in 180 plus countries are building with Rocket because it turns ideas into apps in minutes and not months. So, if you're ready to build your app idea without the months of development, check out rocket.new at the first link in the description. Thank you to Rocket for sponsoring this video. I love what you're building. All right, let's get back to the story. Okay. Well, this video isn't about the coding, it's about the content. It's about validating before you build. So, that's what I really want to talk about. What would be the sort of playbook for finding an idea worth building through content? &gt;&gt; So, step one, pick a painful niche. I would make a bunch of content about it. So, I made a bunch of content about breath work. And ideally, I'd find a co-founder who's technical because I'm non-technical. But I would go out into the market and I would just start making content about a painful problem that people experience. Get traction on that painful problem. Step two, batch your ideas weekly. I would be presenting myself as a solution by just batching my content ideas weekly. Step three, film in bulk. And then I would go and just pump out 30 to 60 videos looking hook, film, done, another one film, done, and have two months worth of content done. Step four, amplify your winners from those pieces of content. I'd see which ones work, which ones don't work. If we have something that I could sell, then let me take the content pieces that won and amplify them. put some spark money behind them. Put some meta ad money behind them and see if that's something that's validated that people are willing to pay for. And step five, just outmarket everyone. Make as many reels as you possibly can. Hire clippers. Do whatever you can with whatever means you have. For us, we're fully bootstrapped. So, I'm just like, I'm the face. I will post like a madman every single day. You could sell whatever you want to sell, but with software, you have a lot of leverage. So find a technical co-founder, write the software, make the app, ship it, and then suddenly you have a business. &gt;&gt; Well, I think that playbook is awesome, but I want to get even more specific. Can you pull up an actual example of content you created that changed the game for your app and turned this into a real business? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, this piece of content we launched in July, and this was the one that really changed a lot for us. Was one that caught fire. Got around 8 million views across all platforms. I thought that this was gonna flop. After I videoed this, I filmed it like three more times because I thought it was bad. The next day, it had a million views. And this is just what came out. And I also framed it, like I said earlier, in this polarizing way. Do you want to know something that they don't want you to know? And it's kind of ambiguous of who they are, but they is kind of if we're talking about health, it's the the nefarious forces that are kind of keeping you sick. And since then, I created this into a series. I want to switch topics a little bit and I want to show the audience people watching here what you guys built. Would you be able to just like show me how the app works? &gt;&gt; 100%. So this is the app. Yeah. So Coherence is a breath work app which means that it's designed to help you relax, focus and sleep better all through the power of breathing. This is the homepage. Here we have little streak counter a little gamification. Here are our six main techniques. So we have coherence breathing, vortex energy which like obviously gives you a little energy boost, focus, stress relief and sleep. So if I click into coherence for example, we have this very simple minimal screen where you can set a timer, adjust volume, etc. But you you press start and this is going to play a sound as you inhale and play a sound as you exhale. It's a subscription model. We have a 3-day free trial on our yearly plan and then our monthly plan is just build monthly. For our yearly, it's $40 and for the monthly it's 10 bucks a month. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. I mean, that app looks awesome. Can you tell me a little bit more about how you built it? What tools did you use and what does it run on? &gt;&gt; We use React Native Expo as our framework. We use Superbase for database and backend, cloud code and codeex as our coding agents. Mix panel for analytics, revenue cat, and then for our marketing site, we use Verscell and Nex.js. For all the design stuff, we use Figma. And then for 3D design, we use rot. And then we use Many Chat for Instagram DM. &gt;&gt; The other question that I'm curious about, what does the profit margins on a business like this look like? And how much are you spending to run this business? &gt;&gt; So, we spend about 2.5K on video editors, which is pretty core to the organic content model. influencers we're just kind of getting into now. So, we're spending about 1 to 2k on that for partnerships, etc. So, we have a ghostriter helps us write some threads, $800 a month. We have a virtual assistant, which really helps with admin and stuff, it's $500 a month. Our coding agents, we spend about 300 a month. Revenue cap comes out to like $100 a month. And then the rest of our tools are about $100 a month as well. So, the total is 5 to six grand a month. We're operating at about 50% margin right now. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well, thank you for sharing that. The last question that I have for everyone that comes on the channel, maybe there's a couple other brothers out there watching this that want to build something. What would be your advice to them? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say keep meditating. It's a very high leverage activity even though it doesn't look like it on the surface. Breathe more and try not to sit all day. Move around throughout the day. take small breaks to move because if you don't, your body will eventually give out if you're coding for 12 hours a day sitting in a chair. &gt;&gt; Well, that's great advice. Thank you guys for coming on to the channel. I think what you did is awesome. Thanks for coming on. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much for having us. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you again to Jack and Nick for coming on to the channel and sharing everything. They shared their cost, how they built this, their whole content playbook. I think that's amazing. That's what starter story is all about. These guys are proof that you can come up with an idea. You can build it with AI coding tools. You can launch it and see what happens. This is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build. So you can take your idea and turn it into a real app using only AI tools. So if you're ready to actually do this, we'll just head to the first link in the description and check out Starter Story Build. That's it for this episode, guys. Thank you again for watching. We'll see you in the next one. Peace. [Music]

TITLE: How We Built It: $30K/month Mobile App
VIDEO ID: rCV-TVCnF6Q
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCV-TVCnF6Q
================================================================================

This is Aayall and Yali, two college students who built an app that at first crushed it with downloads. &gt;&gt; We were averaging 20 downloads a day right off the bat. &gt;&gt; But they had a problem. Almost nobody stayed after the trial ended. Their conversion was horrible. &gt;&gt; If your product is nobody's going to buy it. &gt;&gt; They were stuck at $2,000 a month and they had no idea what to do. So, they decided to scrap everything and go back into the cave. So, we shut down all marketing and spent 4 months completely rebuilding from scratch. &gt;&gt; After doing this, on their second try, they hit $30,000 MR in just 10 weeks. And I brought Aal and Yoli onto the channel to share with me exactly what they changed. In this video, we'll dive into why distribution does not matter if your product sucks, how to identify if your product is actually doomed from the start, and AAL and Yali's exact playbook for building a product that actually makes money in 2025. This one [music] is a mustwatch for anyone building apps right now. I'm Bow Walls and this is Starter Story. Yali and Aall, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; Hey, I'm Aal. Hey Pat, I'm Yi and together and I built an app that makes $30,000 a month. We launched it around a year ago, we got stuck at $1 to $2,000 MR. We took 4 months to rebuild it and then it skyrocketed. &gt;&gt; Okay, before we get into what you guys changed that skyrocketed your app. I do need to understand what is your app and what does it do? &gt;&gt; We built Prop GBT which is basically a sports betting analytics platform that uses our machine learning algorithm to hit the most picks. So users get access to our models and get to analyze their own picks or look through all the pre-analyzed bets that we scan every single day. We do about $30,000 a month and we've had over 40,000 downloads and over 3,000 paying customers. We have a 48% conversion to trial rate. And for every user that downloads Propt, we make around $3.30. &gt;&gt; What did the build process look like before you went and you know got on the app store? We spent like five months building the first version of Project BT and it was taking a while to build particularly because Chachi PT was still new. Eventually in the middle of the NFL season last year, that's when we started launching and that's when we sort of figured out that our product market fit wasn't exactly what we wanted. All right, guys. Black Friday is in just a couple days and as you might already know, we are doing something huge at Starter Story. I do not want you to miss out on one of the best deals we've ever done [music] because last year our Black Friday deal sold out in just 2 hours. And once people hear about this year's deal, I'm positive it's going to sell out even faster. So, if you don't want to miss out on that, just go to startertory.com/blackf friday or hit the first link in the description and we'll notify you as soon as the deal is live. Spots are going to be very limited for this, so what are you waiting for? All right, let's dive into the interview. Okay, so you get this idea up on the app store, you're ready to go. How do you actually get users for this app? How many users did you get? And kind of where did you get this app to up to that point? &gt;&gt; The moment we got on the app store, we had a really good base of influencer marketing. I had worked with other really successful app founders before and I kind of saw the rise of the initial like influencer marketing hype. We start spending a few thousand on influencer marketing to see like how many downloads we would get for the money spent. And we were able to get around 20 downloads a day, which converted around like 5 to 10 users a day because we had really high conversion from downloads to free trials. &gt;&gt; And we couldn't really push past 1 to 2k MR. So we kind of noticed that there was something critically wrong with our app despite seeing a lot of hype around it. &gt;&gt; That's one of the reasons why I wanted to bring you guys on the channel, which I think is super interesting. you kind of had the distribution figured out, but you noticed that even though you kind of knew how to crack this code, you really couldn't get the app past 1 to 2K MR. How did you solve that problem? How did you eventually build an app that's making over $30,000 a month? &gt;&gt; We realized that what our customers actually wanted was just to be given the right answers to the test and not necessarily go through the sports books and input their bets and check for themselves if it was a good bet or not. So, we took 4 months to rebuild the app, no marketing, just engineering and design work. And we launched the new version on April 15th, where we were at $1,700 MR and around 15 downloads a day. This is after a few months of no marketing. The next month, we go allin on marketing again for the NBA playoffs. And all of a sudden, our conversion rate to paid was over 50%. 2 and 1/2 months later, we hit our peak of 40K MR and 2,000 downloads in a single day. See, even though Aayal and Yali had the distribution figured out from day one, they still had a huge problem. The product simply was not good enough. So, they spent 4 months rebuilding it. And that's when everything changed. This is exactly why learning how to build with AI is so powerful. When you know how to build and what to change, you can iterate fast and optimize based on what your users actually need. And this is exactly what we teach inside Starter Story Build. Starter Story Build is our live program where you will learn how to build and launch your project using AI tools in just a few weeks. You'll learn how to think like a developer and how to use AI to build real working [music] products just like Aal and Yali. Our next accelerator is starting soon. So, if you're ready to start building, if you're ready to get off the sidelines, head to the first link in the description to claim your spot. [music] All right, now let's get back to the video. Okay, so you guys realized that, no offense, there's a better way of saying it, but you had a bad product or the product wasn't simple enough, but it took you guys a while to realize this. For anyone that's watching this right now who's built something or thinking about building something, what would be your advice on how to figure out how to build a great product? What are the actual things you should be doing every day to avoid this mistake or at least fix it if it happens? &gt;&gt; The most important thing is to have an extremely humble attitude about your product. If your product is then simply it's not going to work. Like nobody will buy it. Using analytics platforms like Post Hog and simply talking to enough users, you see that there's a pattern of human behavior that doesn't align with how the app is designed. For example, on Superwall, we saw that a lot of people were converting to the trial, but then nobody was staying after. Like, what does that really say about your users? What it means is that your users think this is a great idea. They think that this could add a lot of value to their life, but when it actually comes to using the app, it's not the experience that they were hoping for. These signals is what a good product manager should do, and it's going to mean that your business model will work a lot better when you make sure that your product actually best fits your users. Based on all you guys' learnings, I would love if you guys gave me sort of the playbook for how to build a great product, specifically how to build a great app in 2025. Can you break that down for me? Step one, really understand who exactly you're building for and what their pain points are. Step two is listen to your data. We became obsessed with the numbers. Again, two numbers that stuck out for us. 45% conversion to trial, but then only 13% conversion from trial to paid. What does that mean? Everybody wondered what we were selling, but the product was Step three, obsess over analytics. So, if you know your users are falling off during onboarding, then you know which screens aren't selling your app well enough. If you track all of the feature clicks on your app, you can identify your app's most compelling value proposition and then communicate that in your marketing. Any way that you can see what your customers is actually doing is a massive advantage. Step four, once your app is built, the real challenge is scaling it effectively. The smartest way to grow today is through influencer marketing. Their followers engage deeply and convert faster when they see someone that they admire using your product. Another great advantage of organic social media marketing is the chance to go viral. So, for example, probably our 70th video to ever come out hit 600,000 views and that raised our ARR from around 8K to 38K in about 3 days. And that's really the power of influencer marketing. One video can seriously change your entire business. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well, thanks for sharing that demo. That was awesome. On a similar note, I'm curious, what's the tech stack behind this app? How did you build it? And then also like what tools do you use on a daily basis? &gt;&gt; We built this on a React native repo. We mostly used a lot of TypeScript and Python for our machine learning algorithms um along with our automated fetching for all of the data. Additionally, we have a giant database which we store on Neon and tools for analytics. We use Revenue Cat and Superwall for revenue dashboards and paywalling. &gt;&gt; What are the costs or the profit margin around running an app like this? Yeah, so the costs are basically 20 cents per conversion to Super Wall, typically 1% to Revenue Cat. We pay for a lot of data APIs to get all the realtime sports data every single day and that cost about $100 a month. We also spend about $10 a month on our Neon database, make sure we have the bandwidth for all the calls that we make. LLM costs cost about $20 a month and the cost is constantly going down. Marketing is about $10,000 a month. All in all, we have roughly 50% margins at the end of the day. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well, thank you for sharing that, being transparent around the numbers. A lot of people who watch us really appreciate that. The last question that I have for both you guys, a lot of people watching this want to build apps like you want to learn about distribution and product. What would be your advice to people that are starting out right now trying to do this thing online, build apps, and make money? biggest piece of advice I could give is have a co-founder who you will be able to lean on and that will be able to lean on you when things get hard. As an entrepreneur, be honest with yourself and scientific about whether what you're working on has enough demand. And if you prove it to yourself that it's worth the time investment that you will put in struggling, it will be an order of magnitude easier to prove it to others to both investors and future team members. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Well, thank you Aal and Yali for coming on. what you built is awesome. Congratulations. You guys are awesome. &gt;&gt; Pat, thanks so much. We absolutely love Starter Story. It's so cool to get on. &gt;&gt; Appreciate it, Pat. We had a great time. &gt;&gt; What I thought was interesting about their story is usually you get the product right, but you don't have the distribution figured out. For them, they had the distribution figured out, but they didn't get the product right. And I think that's cool because it really goes to show that you have to have both figured out if you actually want to build something that can last. This is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build, where we will help you take your idea and turn it into a real app using only AI tools. So, if you're ready to finally build that idea, get it out of your head, and get it into the real world, well, head to the first link in the description right below to check out Starter Story Build. All right, guys, that's it for this episode. Thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed it. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: My website makes $35K/month (built in 3 hours)
VIDEO ID: LWPN-PAhtLA
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWPN-PAhtLA
================================================================================

Cursive directory. We built it in a weekend and now it makes 35k per month. &gt;&gt; This is Pontis, a developer bored on his flight to France when he spotted an opportunity. The second he landed, he called his friend. They coded for 3 hours straight and launched a simple directory. &gt;&gt; When I landed, I called Victor and said, "We need to build this directory for cursor rules." &gt;&gt; That 3-hour build is now doing $34,000 a month with 99.8% 8% profit margins and they only work on it 3 hours a month. &gt;&gt; We posted a site on X and it instantly took off. I have never seen something like that before. [music] &gt;&gt; I thought directories were dead in 2025, but Pontis has proved me wrong and showed me that anybody [music] can do this. So, I brought Pontis on the channel to break down exactly how he did it. In this video, we'll dive into exactly what tools he used to build a $34,000 a month website in just 3 hours. the secret to why his directory took off when many others don't and his advice for anyone building websites like this right now. All right, this one is crazy. So, let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. Hey guys, I wanted to pop in here with a very important message. Black Friday is around the corner and you know I'm going to be doing something I probably shouldn't. To celebrate over 700,000 subscribers here on YouTube, I'm going to be giving away one of the best deals we've ever done on Starter Story. Last year, our early bird Black Friday deal sold out in less than 2 hours. And this year, I think it'll sell out in less than one. And I don't want anyone of my subscribers on YouTube to miss this. So, here's the deal. I've set up a VIP list where you will be notified about our Black Friday deal before anyone else. And trust me, it's going to be one of the best deals we've run in years with extras and bonuses I probably won't ever do again. If you want to get notified as soon as it's live, just head to the first link in the description and you can join that VIP list right now for free. Thank you everyone for watching and supporting the channel. Let's get into the video. All right, Pontis, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. Uh yeah, my name is Pontis and together with my best friend Victor, we spent the past two years bootstrapping our startup midday which is our long-term focus. Along the way, we built the curs of the directory languin and several other open-source projects. We love building in public, testing ideas quickly and showing that even a small weekend project can turn into something big. One example that is the directory we built, cursive directory. We build it in a weekend and now it makes 35k [snorts] per month. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. I mean you're building a lot of cool stuff but what I really want to dive into is the directory. Can you explain what a directory is and what your directory does? &gt;&gt; So basically a directory is of course made for discoverability uh to find something that you're interesting in and curs directory of course is made for for cursive developers to explore and find new ideas. We grown the site to 49,000 registered users uh 2.2 million unique visitors since launch and then of course we have a gross margin of 99.8% 8% uh and operation cost is just under 500 bucks and of course it's open source. All the rules are merged on in GitHub. So the maintenance cost is like 3 hours per month and then we continue building our main startup. &gt;&gt; Well that's absolutely insane. You just built this directory in a couple hours. Millions of people have visited. It's made tens of thousands of dollars. I want to understand how do you even get the idea to do something like this? &gt;&gt; The whole idea came up when I actually took the flight down to move to France. It's a three-hour flight and I downloaded a lot of videos to look on tech heavy stuff and I I downloaded some cursor things and then I discovered this common pattern about rules. So, it was kind of mind-blowing for me that there were no uh place to find these rules in one specific place. Uh you could Google and find some obscure gist on GitHub or some forums but no real clear answer to finding these rules in one place. And that's basically how the idea came up. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. So, you find this idea, it doesn't exist yet. How do you go about building it? Both me and Victor has a lot of experience building apps and websites through the years. So, uh we knew exactly what we needed to do. I I I called Victor as soon as I landed on the Airbnb uh and said to him like we need to create a directory for rules for cursory rules. In just matter of minutes, he spun up Figma and started to design while I started initial project with Nex.js and I created a hard-coded JSON file with some rules that I found online and in matter of like an half an hour we had something up in Versel uh ready to to click around on. I bought the cursor directory domain uh which was a really really good domain according to the site of course. So we built the site completing three hours and but then we just continued to iterate. Victor and I have been working together for several years. We already know our DNA in terms of design and code. So that helped a lot of course. &gt;&gt; So I mean this is one of the reasons why I wanted to bring you on the channel. The fact that you did it in 3 hours and had the balls to actually launch it and ship it and maybe be okay with it not feeling perfect. What would be your advice for anyone watching this that wants to ship fast? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so of course I have this main startup that we focus on day in and day out, right? We work a lot of hours. Usually once a week or twice a week, we find these things that you can really do really, really fast, but we hold off. But in this case, we didn't. And I think that's something that comes like a thread through how we work. We find these ideas and that comes together when you dial in and work fully on something you're committed to and being out there and seeing a solution that you can do. Well, yeah. I I think it's a combination of dialing in into what you're doing and being out there and finding ideas at the same time. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. I'm what I'm hearing there. What I think is really cool is for the cursor directory, you didn't have a lot of expectations and you just said screw it, I'm going to launch. So, that's where I have a few more questions is, okay, yeah, sure. You build this, you build it really fast. Nowadays, anybody can build stuff fast. How did you actually launch this and get millions of users &gt;&gt; in the first week? That was also the first week in France. Uh, so we did a bunch of different things. So I I posted the the cursor directory uh on on X of course at the initial uh release. I mean we're building public on X. We share everything we do all the way to the code, right? We are fully open source. So I think we had like 1 million impressions on one of the posts and of course we had several posts. So we have a developer following uh from the beginning but then I also posted on hacking news. We ended up on the on the front page and a lot of YouTubers started to cover uh curs directly into the uh videos. So there were a lot of coverage around cursor directory. We grow steadily because we share knowledge along the way and I think that really tied together with cursor right it's it's a developer focused uh community and we build this super fast we have this tech heavy design approach. &gt;&gt; Okay so one thing I noticed about cursor directory and your other startups when I was checking them out is the design. You may not realize this but I feel like your design is a competitive advantage here. When I go to cursor directory, this thing is beautifully designed and I can imagine that was one reason why it kept getting shared to a bunch of other people. So I want to ask you for anyone watching this, how to design beautiful apps, how to do it quickly. What are the secrets to designing products? Well, &gt;&gt; yeah. So basically we have a formula. Of course it helps a lot to have a great designer as a co-founder. It it comes down to to the small things that are also the hardest. Like keep it simple. Find something that you like. Stay with pride and and and find the patterns and the tonality of of the websites that you like and of course learn from others. Uh if I would start from the beginning, I would probably find websites that I love and take bits from it and and learn from that. Uh in this case, of course, we already have a design system. We already have components that we can reuse from our previous startups. So it was much much easier for us. There are a lot of great designers out there that you can follow on X. It's a huge community that you can learn from. I usually tweet out that design is more important than ever especially in this fast-paced AI generated uh website world that we started to live in. Design will actually be the things that puts you apart from the competitors right because it's easy to create an website today but all of them usually looks the same. So, it's not much that you need to be different on, but you need to find the tonality and the angle that you believe in is right, and that's going to be your advantage. &gt;&gt; What I love about Ponis' story is that he built the MVP of his app in just 3 hours. He did not overthink it. He just saw an opportunity and shipped it right after he landed from his flight from France. This is proof that if you know how to build with AI, you can move insanely fast. But here's the thing. Most people waste weeks stuck in tutorials or second-guessing themselves. [music] And this causes people to never actually ship. Well, this is exactly why we created Starter Story Build. It is our program where you will build and launch your project using just AI tools in a matter of weeks. You'll master how to talk to AI. So, it will build apps for you. And the best part is that you won't even be doing this alone. You'll be a part of a group of founders all sharing feedback and staying accountable every single day. So, if you're ready to finally ship your idea, head to the first link in the description to claim your spot. We are starting our next cohort very soon, so be sure to go there and claim your spot right now before it runs out. Okay, now let's get back to the video. Okay, so another reason why I wanted to bring you on Pontis is I haven't heard of a directory that has been crushing it in a long time. I remember a couple years ago directories were kind of taking off. Nowadays, I don't see that as often anymore. I thought directories were dead. Clearly, that's not the case. So my question for you is do directories still work in 2025 or are they dead? Yeah, I mean I get these questions a lot like aren't directors dead but it truly is director still is incredibly successful in 2025 especially if you build something for the right audience and and in this case of course we we found the audience uh at the right time at the core directly solves a timeless problem like you need to find something uh that you're interested in and in this new AI world where we live in like cursor people are starting to look through how to do things and find the right answers [music] that's where directors is really really shine, right? It's a collection of things that a bigger audience are interested in at the same time. And if you can catch that wave, you're really going to find a lot of like visitors and a lot of opportunities. [music] If you catch it, if you can own it, then it's super powerful. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool, Pontis. Well, thank you for sharing all that. I'd love if you actually pulled up your directory right now and showed me how it works, how it looks, and what's the business model. Could you pull it up right now? &gt;&gt; Okay, so yeah, this is directory. So, you have a bunch of different rules. So you can go in and then you copy those then you add that to your uh cursor uh rules in your editor. It's kind of basic. You can filter on your like what you're interesting in. You can see the popular ones. You can see off official ones and then of course you can search for different things. We enable that you could register and create your own account uh and be a member of the of the community. So you can post your own stuff. People can vote uh on interesting things. But here's something that I can just share whatever they are interesting in and get up votes. People can find the jobs and uh companies can share their job ads. So it's a paid uh ad that they pay to get listed some months after MCPS uh came along and that were also a thing that made C directory really really fly. So that was the second way where we saw a huge adoption of the site because we created this uh [music] MCP searchable uh way to find and extend your cursor experience. Uh, and these are also featured. So, you can pay to get them featured on the site. And then we also made it possible to generate your own cursor rules tailored to your to your website. In JavaScript, uh, you have this package JSON which defines all your dependencies. You could just upload that and then you get your defined cursor rules back to tailor that to you. Because we really really saw that developers wanted to tailor their versions or their cursor experience, but they didn't know how to start. this was a good way for developers to started this to get the grasp of it. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, thank you for sharing that. Looks awesome. I'd like to switch topics a little bit and talk about tech stack. How did you actually build this app and what tools you use right now? &gt;&gt; So, I think this is the important one like you should stick with something that you know uh and already uh use uh every day, right? So, we stick what we know. So, we chose Nex.js JS fully TypeScript shing components uh resend for email uh open paniful analytics and just [music] connected with GitHub and and shared it on on Verset. So Verset is our hosting provider. Payments we we use polar which is a great merchant of record to handle uh payments uh especially if you're Europe company. And then on the productivity side we we of course use cursor to code uh notion for product management, GitHub for version control. every tool we choose uh to share have the same philosophy like no servers uh no friction just focus on building and shipping fast because that's really what's matters right getting it out there to our users all in all 525 bucks a month with a 99.8 eight gross margin. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well, thanks for sharing that, being transparent about the numbers, that's an insane profit margin. The last question that I have for you that we ask everyone who comes on Starter Story, what advice would you have for anyone getting started right now, whether they're building a directory or building cool SAS software apps, whatever it is online, what would be your advice? &gt;&gt; Start. It sounds simple, but here's the thing. When you start building and when you commit to something, you eventually getting dialed in. You create your own luck by constantly finding ways to move forward, shipping, sharing, and iterate. One thing will lead to another and there's really no such thing as failure. When you build something, the worst thing that can happen is you learn and then you take next step to find your ways forward. &gt;&gt; Well, that's great advice. Thanks for coming on the channel, Pontis, sharing all this amazing story, amazing business, amazing stuff that you're building other than cursor directory. So, thanks for coming on and sharing. &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me. &gt;&gt; Okay, first of all, that advice was amazing. Just get started. You don't know if this directory that you build is going to be a complete flop or is going to make $34,000 a month. There's no way to know that without actually getting started building something and seeing what happens. It all starts with a simple idea. And nowadays with what you can do with AI, an idea is all you need to potentially build something that changes your life. This is why we launched Starter Story Build, where we will help you take your idea from your head, turn it into a real app using only AI tools in a matter of weeks. So, if you're ready to launch your project and you're serious about actually building something, head to the first link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. All right, that's it for this episode. Thank you guys for watching. We'll see you in [music] the next one. Peace.

TITLE: How I Built It: $400K/Month Mobile App (Gravl)
VIDEO ID: 2dfMUtHlQik
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dfMUtHlQik
================================================================================

Last month, we made over $440K. &gt;&gt; Meet Julian, a developer from Argentina who built an app that makes over $400,000 a month. But it didn't start that way. Before the success, Julian was a dude at the gym who discovered a different app that he thought was pretty cool. However, instead of just using it himself, he thought, "What if I built something better?" And that's exactly what he did. He built an MVP, posted about it on Reddit, and the rest is history. I posted this thread on how I build. We got our first couple of thousand users. I can't really remember, but it was a lot. That was the biggest high probably I've ever had. I brought Julian onto the channel to break down this story and how he actually built an app used by hundreds of thousands of people. In this episode, we'll dive into the original app he cloned in just two months. The simple Reddit strategy that got him his first users and product market fit and the marketing playbook that scaled his app to over $400,000 a month. Let's dive in. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, Julian, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; Hey Pat, I'm Julian. I'm one of the co-founders and developer of Gravel, an AI fitness app that provide smart workouts for the gym. We launched around 2 years ago and now we have over 70,000 subscribers. Last month we made over 440K. &gt;&gt; Okay, over 400K with an app is insane. We're going to get all into that, but before we do, I want to understand a little bit more about your background. How do you even get into building an app? &gt;&gt; I grew up in Argentina. My dad used to own a fitness center. I pretty much spent all my time outside of school just playing sports and at the gym. I then got into software engineering and uh moved to Australia. And yeah, here I worked from small startups to big tech companies like Atlassian, a few TV channels, even an investment fund. And around co my best friend and also our partner came up with the idea of starting a company. It was like a at start a influencer marketing platform for mobile games. That's how we started. Fast forward a couple years, we ended up being some sort of a marketing agency which was something that I didn't sign up for. Neither did the guys. But the good thing is that we learned a lot about uh user acquisition and marketing, but also what the numbers were. So, in terms of revenue and after seeing some of those numbers, we obviously thought apps make a lot of money and especially fitness apps. So, we kind of used our background to decide that we wanted to start our own app. &gt;&gt; You had this business. You started with partners. It wasn't really what you wanted to build. Maybe it wasn't fully scalable. How does that turn into building an app that now makes over $400,000 a month? &gt;&gt; The business wasn't doing great. And because we transitioned into this kind of agency format, I had all this like energy for developing something that wasn't being used. So, I started with a more like a workout tracker kind of app. So apps like heavy, strong, that kind of thing. But as I was building it, I noticed that okay, I'm not adding any value. It just felt like copy of what they were doing. And then it was one of my mates. He showed me Fitbot. And Fitbot is one of the biggest workout app. And when he showed me the app, I was like, "Oh, like this is amazing." Cuz it kind of provided you with workouts on the spot and you didn't really have to do anything else. But then I started using it, doing some research. I noticed that the workouts were weird and even a bit dangerous sometimes. And like the more I used it, I was like, "Wow, okay, these workouts are actually bad." That's what triggered me. And then I was like, "Okay, this is it. We need to build FitBot UI UX with an actual proper workout engine." That's kind of when we went all in on building it. &gt;&gt; Can you tell me a little bit more about how you built it and how long it took? Initial MVP took around two to three months maybe. We can split the MVP into two parts. First part being pre FitBot and then after Fitbot. The first part of the MVP was more of the tracker. Then we transition into the Fitbot stuff and that's when things got trickier. There's a lot of business logic around building custom workouts for people. There's just a lot of different settings and combinations. Things like equipment, things like your weekly goal, how often do you go to the gym, are you consistent, uh your gender, your weight, your age. There's just so many things to consider. That was the definitely the the most challenging part. &gt;&gt; Tell me about how you launched this, how you got your first customer. What did you do to get this app off the ground and get into people's hands? &gt;&gt; I'm a massive supporter of of Reddit as a distribution channel. I posted this thread on how I built Gravel. Back in the day, it was called Games AI and I shared kind of the technical specs around it. It got over a couple hundred likes within the first couple hours and over 300,000 impressions. Yeah, we got our first couple thousand us. I can't really remember, but it was a lot. We found out that because they're developers and they like tech and some of them might like going to the gym, but they feel like it's a bit intimidating. I feel like a lot of them were actually using the app. And then we started getting feedback about like bugs and feature requests and were like, "Okay, we were on to something." And that was the final push that we needed cuz at this point the app was was free. And we're like, "Okay, now we need to build like a serious business out of this and and try to start running some ads for it." &gt;&gt; Okay, let's talk about something that is changing the game for builders right now. AI. Now, I know we talk about AI apps a lot on this channel, but I still get this question every day from builders. Where do I even start? That's where HubSpot for Startup's AI adoption playbook comes in handy. It's a free guide with a three-step framework on how to use AI inside your business. Inside, you'll learn how to spot AI opportunities in your workflow, implement AI without hiring expensive consultants, and see the exact playbooks companies are using to get real results. What's even cooler is it's sourced from executives at HubSpot, Enthropic, and Replet, some of the biggest AI companies in the world right now. My favorite part is inside the case studies where you will see exactly how one company booked 11,000 meetings and another resolved customer issues 39% faster using this framework. These are real numbers from real businesses. So, if you're ready to get ahead in the AI race, download HubSpot for Startup's free AI adoption playbook at the first link in the description below. Thank you to HubSpot for sponsoring this video. Let's get back into it. I'm sure that probably isn't what got you to over $400,000 a month. So, what has been the actual distribution strategy or the secret sauce behind Gravel on how it grew to over $4 million a year? &gt;&gt; For us, the bigger distribution was paid ads. We started running ads as soon as we obviously added the subscription model. I still remember like running our first app. We got a subscription within the first 10 minutes of like activating the ads. Yeah, that was the [music] biggest high probably I've ever had. And after that, we translated the app to Spanish. We started running ads on South America. And we were spending less than 50 bucks a day on ads. And that's what worked for us from the start up until this day. The next question I have for you that I'm curious about is you've built this app. It's huge. It's doing over $400,000 a month. What would be your top learnings or top tips for anyone building apps in 2025, specifically consumer apps or even uh fitness specific? &gt;&gt; The tip number one for sure will be to validate before spending money on ads. And when I say validate, it's not just that the product work, but also that people are willing to pay for it. That's also something very important. Tip number two would be and this is where we kind of got lucky because well I'm Spanish speaking and Matias as well so we're like it makes sense for us to translate it into Spanish and then potentially running ads that are cheaper in in South America the US even though we all want to end up there and running ads there is expensive there's a lot of competition tip three is start small you can pay influencers or content creator as low as 50 bucks for some piece of content. You can use AI tools to create videos. You can use Capkart to edit your own videos and you can get some pretty good results with that. It's not as hard as you think to create an ad. The hard thing is is creating the volume. And tip four, like I said, UGC is king. You'll see that most of the ads that work out there are UGC [music] content. You'll seeing a lot of AI videos and that's cost of producing them is cheap and they're easy to test. Last thing would be copy. copy and copy. Good thing about Meta Ads library is that it's all public. You can go into any of your competitions dashboard and see, you know, which ads are working for them, where they putting more money and yeah, there's no secret source there. Just copy what works for them and start like that. It'll probably work for you. I would definitely start there. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well, those tips were amazing. I'd love if you could show us what your app does and give us a quick demo of how it works and how something like this could potentially make $400,000 a month. &gt;&gt; This is our app. This is Gravel. We're an AI fitness app specifically designed for strength training and gym workouts. This is the screen you'll see when you first download the app. So, this is our landing screen. We get your name and then we'll just go and ask you a series of questions like why you want to use a fitness app. We ask you about your experience. Let's say I'm an advanced user. Depending on on your level, we'll ask more specific questions like what's your one rep max for certain exercises, your goals, ask you about your training frequency, your working split, like we use AI here and there. Make sure that you are showing the users that this is an AI app cuz that's sales. Now, again, more questions specific to how you want to train excluded muscles and focus muscle help us, you know, design the workout towards something that you kind of like. Where do you train? cuz like [snorts] I said, we adapt to your gyms and anywhere you train. So, here is where you could create kind of that gym profile. This kind of screen where we generate and show the user that we're generating a custom workout. You get to this final screen where you get your plan kind of summary. Here we go. Hard payw wall before you sign in for the first time. It's like how many users are actually going to pay before they actually see their product. And the answer is a lot. This is what you see when you first open the app. The main thing is the workout card. That's the main thing about the app. That's 90% of your flow is going to be within the active workout. Here you just get a list of exercises that you need to do. From here on is like kind of works like a workout tracker. We have proper content for every video. We have a description and how to do each exercises. And then we have a lot of smart AI features like you know if you sort exercises the weights are adjusted based on the order that there are. The app is pretty complete in terms of everything you need to do at the gym. Also things like recovery rate uh will tell you how tired or not your muscles are based on your previous workout and that includes external workouts from Apple Health, from Straa, it could be runs, it could be anything. We'll learn from that and we'll adapt your workouts accordingly. And one of the important thing that we grew a lot with this and that was our support. So we have a 247 support chat inside the app and that includes everything from articles to messages and we'll have someone reply an actual person not an AI. That's something that users value a lot. That's pretty much &gt;&gt; On a similar note I'm curious what's your tech stack? How did you build this app? We use uh React Native and Expo. For the back end, I did.NET for most of the core functionality. I've also used Next and React to build some like internal admin dashboards. In terms of AI, so I try to stay kind of niche with the what I use cursor a lot, but I'm very specific which files to touch and don't let the AI just go [music] rogue basically. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hey guys, Julian here with a little async update from the future. We finished recording the video and realized that we didn't really go into um numbers and financials of the business. Obviously, very important for you to know and I'm also happy to share some of them. Our expense number one is Meta and Tik Tok and then [music] maybe a little bit of Google, maybe a little bit of Apple search. I'd say a third is somehow accurate. A third of our revenue that is. This doesn't include making the ads but just the cost of running them. Expense number two is salaries. It was mainly just the three of us for a first year. I did the development and then Matias and Aaron did the growth and ads. Since then, we've grown the team to probably maybe 13 to 14 people, give or take. There's some like part-times. There's some contractors. I'd say somewhere between 50 and [music] 80K. Obviously, let's not forget the 15% from Apple. Revenue cut. It's a 1% clip from revenue as well. We have MMPS, which is maybe a grand a month. And then in terms of infrastructure for running the actual app like servers and AI bills and other tools, I'd say around a grand a [music] month as well. &gt;&gt; The last question that I want to ask you and what we ask all founders who come on Starter Story, what would be your advice to anyone watching this right now that wants to build something? &gt;&gt; Be proud of what you build. Cuz at least for me, the motivation that comes from building something that I'm excited about can't be matched by anything else. It's always easier to grind and work for zero dollars when you love what you're doing. Another thing will be to keep pushing then don't give up too soon. It's a long road. So building it is just not even half of it. Be ready to do all the hustling of you know the Reddit stuff that I did for example and then having ads that don't work and you're going to get some punches. So you need to know that you just need to keep going. And in saying that, it's also knowing when to when to give up actually when you're like, "All right, this product doesn't work." So that's also a very important thing. In our case was our previous startup. We probably dragged that for an extra year. We should have probably called it days like way earlier. &gt;&gt; Well, that's great advice. Thank you, Julian, for coming on to the channel. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Pat. Thanks for the time. &gt;&gt; What I love about Julian's story is his app is crushing it. is making over $400,000 a month, but also it's something he's super passionate about. Julian clearly loves fitness and working out, and how cool is it that you get to build an app that makes hundreds of thousands of people's lives better, and it's something that you love, too. That is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build so you can do the same in Starter Story Build. We will help you ship your idea to the real world in just a couple weeks, as long as you are ready to actually launch your product. So, if you are, head to the link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. That's it for this episode of Starter Story. Thank you guys for watching. I'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: I Built 3 SaaS Apps to $200K MRR: Here's My Exact Playbook
VIDEO ID: 67zh8_yiPh4
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67zh8_yiPh4
================================================================================

Right now, we have five apps and we're doing just over [music] 200 grand MR. &gt;&gt; This is Mike, a founder from Australia who built five different SAS apps that make a combined $200,000 MR. But here's what's interesting. Each successful app he's created follows the same repeatable framework. And this framework works so well that he guarantees every app he puts through it becomes successful. &gt;&gt; I like to build ideas that can't fail. I asked Mike to come onto the channel and he shared everything, including his five apps that make $200,000 a month, how he picks ideas that cannot fail, and his exact 10-step playbook that he uses over and over. This episode you cannot miss. So, let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. All right, Mike, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; Hey Pat, my name's Mike. I've currently got three SAS businesses doing over 200 grand a month, and we've got two more on the way. Current businesses are curator.io, juno.co, frillrill.co, fluke.co, and soonmile.co. Our aim over the next 5 years is to get to about a million dollars MR. And we want to do that with the smallest team possible um without raising any [music] capital. &gt;&gt; All right. Amazing. You have a bunch of different apps making a ton of money. Can you share a little bit more about what your businesses do and what your holding company does as a whole? &gt;&gt; Our current businesses are curator.io, which is a social media aggregator for websites and events. Frill.co, which is a customer feedback tool, which allows you to collect customer feedback, plot it to a road map, and announce new features. Juno.co, which is a digital signage business uh aimed at cafes, gyms, schools, [music] and shops. And fluke.co, co which is a no code tours platform that allows you to build onboarding tours [music] for SAS businesses tool tips pop-ups things like that without having to bother the developers and our final business which we're launching in the next two weeks is Smile which is [music] an innovative way at doing group ecards for B2B businesses and altogether these five apps make uh just over 200 grand a month we're fully bootstrapped and we've used exactly the same playbook to launch all of them &gt;&gt; okay I'm excited to get into the playbook of how you did this clearly is working. You've done it with three about to be five companies. Before we get into that, I want to understand a little bit about your background. How do you get to the point where you own multiple SAS businesses? &gt;&gt; Well, I used to be a developer, one of the world's worst developers. I was a Flash developer and um ended up running an agency, a digital advertising agency and sold that a number of years ago. I somehow fell into advertising, ironically [music] realized I was rubbish at advertising. And what I really loved was building products. And [music] that's how I got back into building products. &gt;&gt; Okay, Mike, one of the big reasons I wanted to bring you on the channel is you have this sort of strict and meticulous way of looking at building apps, choosing ideas of what to build, and I really like your approach. So, could you break that down for me? What is your approach to building apps? &gt;&gt; So, our entire approach is about minimizing risk. I expect every single one of our businesses to be successful. We have a much higher rate of success. We haven't had a failure. So, our model is like this. We go and find the idea. Uh we work out how well they're doing despite of a bad UX. We then go and assemble the team. We like to have it tech heavy. So we'll have a front-end developer, a back-end developer, ideally a designer as well, and then somebody like myself who who does everything else around the product. We always start with four co-founders. What that does is minimize founder fallout, which is one of the key reasons most businesses [music] fail. We prioritize design quite heavily. We believe that good [music] design sells, which is why we like to have a designer on on the team. We like people [music] that can do a little bit of everything. We like every single person on the team to be thinking about the UX of the product. That's really really crucial to uh who we get on board. With those four co-founders, we always split the company equally, 25% each. We then grow the company to about $10,000 [music] MR, which covers costs there or thereabout, depending on which company it is. Then after $10,000 MR, we split [music] the profits between the founders and that's when we start to pay ourselves. These businesses are about bigger salaries, not big exits. We don't invest as much money back into advertising. We don't invest as much money back into uh staff. We stay super super lean so that all the profits [music] come out to the founders. &gt;&gt; What I love about Mike's story is his approach to building. He doesn't just build apps randomly. [music] He actually knows what separates successful SAS businesses from failures. And HubSpot for Startups, who I'm partnering with for today's video, also knows a few things about successful companies, too. Over 35,000 [music] customers rely on them to grow their startups, and they just put together an insane resource called How to Build a Unicorn in 2025. It's a free high signal guide packed with the sharpest data and founder insights shaping billion-dollar businesses today. Inside, you'll discover what kinds of companies are actually winning, hot industries, fast rising topics, and how you can build something [music] around these ideas. My favorite part about this is that they removed all the fluff and made it as quick and actionable as possible so you can walk away and start executing on these ideas [music] immediately. So, if you're building anything in 2025 and want to understand what separates winners from everyone else, just download HubSpot for Startups free guide at the first link in the description below. Thanks again to HubSpot for Startups for sponsoring this video. Let's get back into it. Okay, I think this is amazing. You sort of have this framework for how to find ideas and how to build an idea that's almost impossible to fail as you sort of explained. I want you to get more detailed though. Can you break down this playbook step by step? So anybody watching can do the same? &gt;&gt; Sure. We have a 10-step playbook and we follow this to the letter every single [music] time we launch a business. First and foremost, pick an idea that's been done before. New ideas are risky. Uh new ideas need validation. If you pick an idea that's been done before, you know that people want it. You know that it works. Number two, decide what is a good enough MVP. You need to work out from your competitors what are the things that their customers want the most. Build the MVP. Get it out there as quickly as possible. Get people using it. Core to how we make money early on is the third point in our playbook. Offer a lifetime deal. Offer away your product for $59, $100, whatever it is for a single time payment. Number four, never give away an account for free. Always charge people. If [music] people pay for it, they'll use it. That's key to what you want at this stage in the playbook. You want people using your product. You want people telling you why it's crap. You want people giving you as much feedback [music] as possible. Number five, do as much work as possible to sell a private LTD. Work in Reddit groups. Work in private Facebook groups. Get on to X. Find out where your customers are living. Work with the LTD groups, of which there are many, to get your product bought by as many people as possible. For Frill, we launched a private LTD and raised about 30 grand from our private LTD. Number six, start writing content. It is never, ever, ever, ever too early to start writing content. Start writing landing pages, start writing blog posts. Use that money that you got from the private LTD to start writing content. Write competitor pages, [music] alternative to pages. Get it out there as early as humanly possible. The longer it's up there, the longer chat GPT, the longer Google will start [music] indexing it and start sending you traffic. Once you've started writing content, launch on AppSumo or one of the other marketplaces. AppSumo is great because they have huge, huge reach. You can do two different things on AppSumo. You can launch on their marketplace, which has a lower fee, or you can work with their sales team and work on their select offering. Both work. Do your own research there, but they have a huge, huge database of people that they can mail [music] out to. This can get you, again, way more users and a hell of a lot more capital. Your aim should be to close your LTD with 100 grand in your pocket that you can use for a year or two year to write more content. Once you've done an Absumo Ltd, move to stage eight, which is do one last private LTD. Many people don't want to miss out on a deal. So, this is where you're closing off your LTD, your lifetime deal for life. It will never ever be available again. Poop your prices up a little bit and offer one last private LTD. send it out to your mailing list and then close it and ideally close it forever. [music] Stage nine is crucial. This is live or die moment. You've got 100 grand or however much you raise from your LTD in the bank. This is where you get your customers to write your current LTD customers to help you get an honest review on Trust Pilot [music] uh on G2. Uh wherever they're willing to write you reviews, it's so incredibly important. It will uh boost your domain ranking and get honest reviews for you. You'll find that the LTD community are willing to do that [music] because they really, really want you to succeed. They're your early ambassadors. It used to be Kora that we would go out and answer questions on, but more and more we're seeing uh Reddit as an important place to go and answer questions uh about your product. Uh scan Reddit, see who's asking for one of your competitors. Answer honestly, authentically on Reddit posts on, you know, look for subreddits where your customers are hanging out. This is such a crucial stage because you've now moved to MR. Money's depleting, but hopefully you're starting to get MR. And by the time your money runs out, hopefully you've got enough MR to stay alive. That's it. That's the 10step process. This has worked for us on three companies. We're halfway through the playbook on a fourth company. We're about to start it on the fifth company. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you for sharing that playbook. That's amazing. Super tactical, super step-by-step, and I can see how that works. I want to jump back to the earlier steps of the playbook, which is finding ideas. Specifically, you really focus on finding ideas that can't fail. Can you go a little bit deeper on that? What is an example of an idea that can't fail? And then what is an example of an idea that could potentially fail that you wouldn't touch? &gt;&gt; So, one I will tell you is is one idea that or an area that we will never go after. We will never go after an AI focused [music] business. Too many times you have an idea that relies on something, an API that you do not control, something that you're not in control of, which puts you at massive, [music] massive risk. Having said that, one idea that we, you know, we almost went after, um, we still may go after, we we love the idea of some sort of documentation tool. I don't feel like the documentation tools that are out there at the moment are doing a really good job or the ones that are doing a really good job are severely overpriced. And good documentation especially today is going to be the key to success because AI needs good god documentation [music] to recommend your product well to know about your product. So that's something that um I think may work well. We just won't rely on AI to build [music] or be an integral part of the business. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. I like that. Not going after sexy ideas that may not exist in 6 months. Avoiding platform risk. I want to switch gears a little bit and talk about tech stack. I know you come from a bit of a development background. How do you actually build these apps and what tech stack do you have them built on? &gt;&gt; The tech stack varies depending on the founding team and what they're comfortable using, whether it's Vue, whether it's React on the front end. Our back end still predominantly sits in PHP uh and Laravel. Uh but again, that changes all the time. Some of the tools I'm loving at the moment, uh Willow Voice, I can barely type anymore. You just press the function key and you can talk at your computer. We're using granola for meeting notes. I absolutely love it. Obviously Slack and things like that. We use Framer for websites. We've just moved over to Framer. Actually, [music] all of a sudden websites are no longer the job of the tech team and more recently VO for prototyping. We prototype everything in VO and then we take it into design and Figma and then we build it. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Thanks for sharing that. The last question that I have for all founders who come on Starter Story, if you could go back in time and give advice to young Mike, before you got started building apps and software and SAS, for anybody who's watching this, what would be your advice to get started and build awesome companies like you're [music] doing? &gt;&gt; Really simply, just work with people you enjoy working with. Work with people that you are quite happy to go and have a drink at the pub with. It's actually the main reason I do all of this. I feel like I go to work every day and I go to work with my mates. It's it's, you know, it's brilliant fun. We [music] spend a lot of time uh working on the details because we love doing that. Don't just create something that customers want. Create something that you love building as well. That's super super important. &gt;&gt; Well, I love that, Mike. What's the point of building businesses if it's not fun? Thank you for sharing everything about all the companies you're building. I think it's going to inspire a lot of people. Thanks for coming on and Sharon Pat. &gt;&gt; Thanks a lot. Have a good day. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Mike, for coming on the channel and sharing all the different apps that you built. Personally, what I love about Mike's apps is that they are all boring. [music] They're boring businesses, but they crush it and they make a whole lot of money. I think there's something to learn there about not chasing shiny, sexy ideas. On that same note, this is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build. We will help you take your idea, which it's okay if it's boring, and turn it into a real app using only AI tools. So, if you are ready to get off the sidelines and ready to actually launch your project, then definitely head to the link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. We are running one of our new cohorts this week. So, click that link and save your spot. All right, [music] that's it for this episode. Thank you guys for watching. We will see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: My 2 apps made $1.5M
VIDEO ID: 9WWvLj-NqEE
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WWvLj-NqEE
================================================================================

Within the last 12 months, I've built two apps that have generated 1.5 million in revenue. &gt;&gt; This is Kletchi, a 22-year-old from Nigeria who moved to the US with nothing but a dream to build a business. &gt;&gt; You know, I moved to the US with literally only $100 my name &gt;&gt; with his back against the wall in just a few months to prove himself. Kletchi built two apps that changed his life. &gt;&gt; Today, my apps have been downloaded over 700,000 [music] times across the App Store and Play Store. &gt;&gt; His secret sauce, distribution. But it's not SEO and it's not Tik Tok. It's something a little different. &gt;&gt; Here's what I think most people don't understand about mobile apps. &gt;&gt; By using the strategy, he was able to get millions of eyeballs on his idea virtually for free. I brought Kletchi onto the channel to break down exactly how he did it. And in this video, we'll dive into his two apps that made over a million dollars, his secret distribution strategy you've probably never heard of before, and his playbook on how he'd start over from scratch today. All right, let's dive in. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. Welcome, Kleti, to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Kishi. Within the last 12 months, I built two apps that have generated 1.5 million in revenue. So, the first one is Social Wizard, and the second one is called Clin. I saw a guy on X talking about how he made a million dollars a month from an app. And right then was when I decided I was going to start building apps. &gt;&gt; Okay. Before we get into the apps that you built, I just want to understand some of the numbers behind this. You've done 1.5 million in revenue. What are these apps and what are some of the numbers behind them? &gt;&gt; Um, so we first launched in, you know, early 2024. I launched my first app and, uh, we went extremely viral. Quickly scaled to about $60,000 a month. Today, we've done over 600,000 downloads. Eventually, after some time, I put that business on autopilot and I launched my second app. And, uh, we hit about 10K in revenue within 2 weeks. and about 4 months later ended up exiting that to a UK based company. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. I want to dig in a little bit into your first app, the first app that you built, the one that made nearly a million dollars. How did you actually find the idea for this app? &gt;&gt; The concept really came from my first app and it was basically a social application where people shared, you know, pictures in groups. It was called Casp. It grew to a few thousand users and over 20,000 pictures were posted on the app, but I mean eventually failed. And there was one particular girl on the app, you know, she would post all these really personal pictures about herself. I'll see her cooking. I'll see her, you know, working. I'll see her in class. And eventually, I became interested in this girl. And we started texting for a bit, but after a while, it didn't really go the way I planned. And so, I went to the app store and I searched up advice, life advice. I didn't really see any apps that could help me. And so, around this time, this was when OpenAI was really going heavy with the LLMs and I just whipped up like a script and I would get like lines to like text this girl. So, it wasn't even a product, it wasn't an app, it was just some back end I was playing around with. It was a script on NestJS that I had built. Eventually, my friends invited me to homecoming. I gave a few [music] people the app to play around with. And this was probably the first time that my high school friends cared about anything I was working on. That was when I realized that there might actually be something here. And eventually I whipped it together, polished it more, and released the app store. &gt;&gt; Okay, so the idea is clearly working. Your friends finally care about it. You launch into the app store, it becomes a live app. But then what I want to know is once you had the live app in the app store, how'd you grow it to make nearly a million dollars? So the first sale came in, you know, very very late January. We made about $10. I spent the next four weeks trying to crack distribution and uh eventually something stuck. You know, I figured out the viral formats. Literally 2 weeks after that happened, 3.5K in MR after 2 weeks. After 1 month, we had crossed $25,000 in MR. I think by month six, we had cash collected about $250,000. That year probably ended with about half a million cash collected. I haven't spent a dollar on marketing within the last year and we're literally still printing which is really good. &gt;&gt; Okay, Kletchi, so you mentioned something really important which is you cracked distribution. I want you to go deeper though. I want you to tell me how you actually cracked distribution. What was the secret sauce behind Social Wizard where there were lots of other apps that I'm sure did the same thing but didn't make nearly a million dollars like yours? &gt;&gt; I think distribution is really a show don't tell kind of game. With Social Wizard, people just use it for texting. Like that's the main use case that guys use it for. Everyone knows that Instagram is a [music] dating site. I think Instagram is a dating site masquerading as a social network. And we had this kind of like streamer strategy that we used to scale the app. There was a feature on social wizard where you can take the screenshots of a girl's story, put it on the app and it would generate like hints to say. That was the format that ended up going viral. But it took me a while to find that format myself. Initially I was making content myself to kind of find what was going to stick. When I found what kind of, you know, worked, then I went [music] to very, very micro streamers, very degenerate streamers. They hadn't really had any viral moments. Maybe they had some videos that had done like 100k, 200k, but I saw the edge with them because, you know, they were hitting the audience that we wanted. And uh I believe that if we worked with them and took shots with the formats that worked, we would go viral. And that's exactly what happened. So, this is an example of a collab that we did with a streamer. You know, I went to him and said, "Hey, this is the format that is working. A lot of people like to see videos like this. just recreate this. Just going to play for you so you see why this went viral and I'll tell you what we actually ended up getting from this video. &gt;&gt; What's this? Oh my god, look at her. &gt;&gt; If you want to go viral, you need to find a strategy to make the viewer pause. If your video doesn't make people pause, they're going to scroll past. And obviously, you can see why people pause on this. It starts with a very pretty girl. [music] And you know, this is literally where we integrate Social Wizard. He doesn't talk about trying to sell the app. The viewer is watching this like a regular video and he says, "Okay, it's a pretty girl. What do I say to the picture? How do I reply to the story? Everyone is probably thinking the same thing. Everyone watching this video is probably thinking, "How does he reply to this [music] story?" And let's see what he does. &gt;&gt; I don't know what to do. You know what? We're about to use the wizard app. Wizard app always do the trick. &gt;&gt; Start a conversation. I'm going add the picture of her. Flirty. All right. Cook up, please. That pink dress looks like it was made just for you. Planning on stealing any hearts tonight? I'm going to use that one. &gt;&gt; Boom. By this point, we've sold everyone what this product is. They don't even need to finish the clip. Distribution is always a show don't tell game. A lot of people think you need to try and sell your products, but demo what it does. Show people how it works. If they find value in it, they're going to download it. They're going to give you money and your app is going to scale. So, with this particular video, I paid this creator about $120 and the video hit 2 million views and brought in tens of thousands of dollars, which is insane [music] ROI. You can't get this on paid ad. You can't get this on UGC. And that's pretty much it. We took this format and we scaled it over and over and over and over and over again across multiple creators, multiple videos, and yeah, we just kept printing. &gt;&gt; One thing I love about Kletchi's story is how fast he built his apps. He had the idea, built it over just a couple weeks, and started getting users right [music] away. This is the power of what happens when you're using the right tools to build. And this is why I love today's sponsor, Emergent. Emergent is a vibe coding platform that turns your idea into a productionready app just by [music] chatting with AI. You can build full stack mobile apps with React Native, download [music] APKs to test on your phone, and deploy directly to the app store. And if you're building AI apps just like Keni, Emergent's universal LLM key gives you instant access [music] to OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini with no complex API setup required. And the best part about Emergent is [music] everything is production ready from day one. Built to handle real users and real traffic [music] without expensive rewrites. Over 1.5 million people are already building with Emergent. And their apps have hit 15 million ARR in just 3 months. If you're ready to turn your idea into a real app without the overhead, check out Emergent at the first link in the description right below. Thank you to Emergent for sponsoring this video. Let's get back into it. My next question for you would be if you were to start all over again knowing what you know, what would be your playbook to build a successful app right now? &gt;&gt; I think in 2025 product development is not enough anymore. If you don't find a way to tell people about your product, then you might as well not even build a product. Step one is I look at the niche. Is there a large volume of content already being produced in this niche? That's the first question I ask myself. And if the answer is yes, then I'll go to midsize to large creators to make [music] content. If it's no, then I would focus on making content myself. And it's very important that you don't outsource this process [music] because you want to learn as much as possible. A lot of people, they have capital and they just outsource the whole thing and they end up burning so much money and it never makes [music] any sense. Step two, produce the content. And this is where most people get it wrong. Working with creators is also a vol game, right? A lot of people reach out to five creators or 10 creators and they're like, "Ah, it's not working. It's not working." But in reality, you might have to reach out to 100 creators to get one that will work for you. But once you find a creator that is willing to work with you and you put out content with them, it's much easier to get more creators on board because then you can have that creator's video and leverage it to other creators. And all you're trying to do is make [music] clips with the creator to find what kind of works, right? A lot of people think you need to find the viral format from day one. Not really. You just need to find something that kind of works. And it's always important that you make content on Tik Tok when you're trying to find a viral format and not Instagram. It's easier to go viral on Tik Tok on new accounts compared to Instagram. create a page, start making content. I'll start with three videos a day. You know, on let's say two accounts, so you have two accounts, you're making three videos a day, maybe two on one account, one on another account. The goal here is consistency and volume. After a week or two, you scale that up to 10. You scale that [music] up to 20. A lot of people believe in this idea of virality being a luck game. But if you're putting out a 100 videos per day, that's 700 videos in a week. If one went viral, I don't think you would call that luck. You would pretty much think that you earned that. And so, when it comes to distribution, it's never luck. It's deterministic. Go full auto. Create as much volume as possible. One would stick. If you try hard enough, you're going to find out viral formats. Step three, scale. If you're working with creators, you want to work with as much as possible. You want to reproduce your content to reach out to more, more, more. The more you reach out, the easier it is to get in contact with more creators and get them pumping out the same videos. You don't have to go to creators that are directly in your space. They could be adjacent. I'll give you an example. For Social Widget, for example, these micro streamers that we work with, none of them were really making content for [music] our space about social skills. It was kind of a lot of different things. They were making content about Fortnite, you know, people breaking into McDonald's, [music] just crazy stuff. They were reacting to videos, but again, they were hitting our audience and there was a lot of potential I saw with them being able to create content. If you're building an app that is in health and fitness, you could go to cooking creators. You don't have to go to creators who are directly in your niche, and if you try hard enough, you'll find something that will stick. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. I mean, that playbook is awesome. It's all about distribution. I want to go back a little bit and talk to you about ideas. You launched two very successful apps. You're a very busy guy. You probably have a bunch more ideas for things that could work. Could you share with the audience right now some of your mobile app ideas you have in 2025? &gt;&gt; I think the education niche is massively overlooked. I mean, right now, everyone is building apps in health and fitness and lifestyle, and that's kind of like where the craze is going today. There's so much information out there. You could build an app about how to get better at boxing, how to get better at swimming, how to even get better at persuasion. If you package it properly, I think there's a huge opportunity there. So, I think education is a really good space I think people should start looking into. &gt;&gt; Uh, well, we haven't really talked about it yet, but I'd love to actually see what you build. You have two apps that made $1.5 million. What are these apps? What do they do? &gt;&gt; So, the first one is Social Wizard. It's an AI powered application that helps guys improve their social skills. Most of the users who use the app are within the ages of 16 to 24. I guess what we're selling here is confidence, making it easier for people to [music] uh reply to the DMs they get. For this app, we monetize through subscriptions. It's a weekly subscription about $10 a [music] week. We have a monthly about 20 bucks and there is a yearly for about 80. And the second one is called Clean Eats. Very simple. It's an app in health and fitness. You scan the barcode of a food product and will tell you how it affects your skin or your weights. Most of the users who use this are [music] women within the ages of 18 to say about 28 is the core market. One thing I'll say app founders need to do is when you look at your products, try to extrapolate what you're actually selling. Because when you're looking at cleans, you can say we're trying to sell this healthy [music] alternatives to products, but what is the purpose of being healthy? What is that going to get me? But if you tell me, hey, don't eat this food product cuz it's going to mess up my skin. I am not going to touch it. I think for both apps, really what we're selling was confidence. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's switch topics here. You built these apps yourself. What's the tech stack? How do you build apps, &gt;&gt; right? So for me, I'm a React Native guy. With all these tools today like charge, it's very, very [music] easy to build a very performative app with React Native. For back end, I love NJS. [music] You can deploy that anywhere. Render Heroku, it doesn't really matter as long as the server works. Database, Firebase [music] is my go-to. Very simple, highly scalable, very affordable. And analytics, we just use Mixpanel. Always optimize for a stack that would get your product out there as soon as possible and is highly scalable. &gt;&gt; And on that same note, I want to understand a little bit about the cost to run a business like this. What are the margins like for a solarreneur running multiple apps? For Social Wizard, most of the expenses was really marketing. You know, after Apple takes their cuts, profit margins are really over 90%. Because there wasn't really much we're spending money on. So, every month, we only spend like 1 to maybe 2K on infrastructure cost. These apps barely cost anything to run. You're going to end up spending like 90% of your budgets on marketing. [music] If you do it properly, the cash flow is insane. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, thank you for sharing that, being transparent about those numbers. The last question that I have for you that we ask everyone who comes on Starter Story, if you could stand on Young Kletchi shoulders before Social Wizard, what would be your advice? Or to anyone who's watching this that wants to build apps, what would you tell them? &gt;&gt; You're not crazy for being extremely obsessed with your goals. You're [music] not weird if you choose not to go out on the weekends because building is all you love to do. And this is something I heard from Alex Mozi. To be exceptional, by definition, you have to be the exception. And I think that's okay. &gt;&gt; That's great advice. Thank you Kletchi for coming on sharing this. Congrats on your success. Two very successful apps. I know people watching this will be inspired. Thank you for coming on. &gt;&gt; Thank you for having me Pat. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you to Kletchi for coming on to the channel. I especially liked what he said at the end there about what tech stack to use. [music] Keep it simple. Build stuff that solves problems and focus on distribution. But in order to do that, you need to actually build something. And what better [music] than to build it with all these AI coding tools that are taking off and allowing you to build apps [music] in days. This is why we launched Starter Story Build, which is our program where in just a couple weeks we will show you how to use AI to build anything you [music] want. So whether you want to launch a mobile app or a microsass, Starter Story Build can help you get there. Just head to the link in the [music] description to check out Starter Story Build. I think you're going to love it. All right, that's it for this episode, guys. Thank you for watching. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: I vibe coded a $20K/month mobile app in 14 days

================================================================================

I'm 23 years old and my apps do over a million dollars in sales a year. &gt;&gt; This is [music] Connor, a 23-year-old kid who cracked the code on building apps that actually make money. &gt;&gt; I built my latest app in less than 2 weeks, 100% with AI. &gt;&gt; To prove it, [music] he joined a hackathon of over 55,000 people, built an app from scratch, grew it to $20,000 a month, and won the entire thing. &gt;&gt; The apps that I build are designed to make money from day one. I asked Connor to come on to the channel to break down his entire playbook for building [music] money-making apps fast. And in this episode, we will dive into how he finds validated ideas that can make money from day one. Exactly how he vibe codes these apps quickly and his step-by-step playbook on how to grow them into money-making machines. Strap in because this is an episode you [music] cannot miss. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, welcome Connor to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; Hi, uh, I'm Connor, and over the past few years, I've built a handful of mobile apps. These apps have done over a million in revenue now. I really only got into entrepreneurship roughly 3 years ago just by watching YouTube videos and staying optimistic on what I'm building. &gt;&gt; Okay, Connor, that's amazing. Can you share with me what types of apps that you've built? &gt;&gt; So, I've built a bunch of different apps. I've probably got around six apps now. My most recent app is called Payout and this is one that I just recently launched in the beginning of August and just scaled it up to doing 20,000 a month in revenue. The downloads is over 12,000 over,300 new subscriptions. [music] One cool thing is this is part of the Revenue Cat Chipoton competition. It's a hackathon that people can release new apps to the app store. This year it had over 55,000 entrance and it won first place for the build and grow award which has a total grand prize of $65,000 for the app that has the most growth over the two-month period. Before we get into the app and how you built it, uh, I got to understand a little bit more about your background. I know you're only 23 years old and this is pretty impressive what you've done. So, tell me how you get to this place where you even start building apps. &gt;&gt; So, before I started building apps, I was just, you know, any other kid playing too much video games, staying up late, no computer science background. One night in the middle of the night, I woke up and I just had a random app idea and I wrote down the whole app idea in my notes. You know, I'd never coded anything. The next morning I woke up and I just started watching YouTube videos and I didn't have a MacBook at the time and I really wanted to make an iOS app and I didn't really have any money so I started doing random tasks just like selling random items around my room and eventually like I got my hands on an old MacBook. I started building a social app called Hotspot Events. This app took me 6 to 8 months to build kind of failed. I really had no idea what I was doing. After that first app I quickly realized that apps that are social are super hard to scale. So I eventually moved on to utilities and tools and these are much more easy to scale as a oneman person. This was all about three years ago and since then I've scaled these apps to doing over a million in subscription revenue. &gt;&gt; Okay. I mean that's amazing. I love that you did this without having all the crazy tools or anything like that. So my next question for you is how do you build these apps? What is your playbook for building these apps? How do you think about building an app from scratch? &gt;&gt; Yeah, before I get into how I do things today, I think it's important that people know that you know you don't need all these fancy tools. I was just watching YouTube videos and going on Stack Overflow and now my process today is pretty straightforward. I have a very specific set of steps that I follow to make sure that the app I'm building has ability to convert, drive a lot of sales, also have really good user retention. My first step is that I'll go and download a whole bunch of apps, maybe 20 apps that are in the niche that I'm diving into, as well as other apps that I just think are beautiful apps that I want to draw inspiration from for their design perspective. The next thing I do is screenshot every single page in every single onboarding. And I take all these screenshots and I'll put them all on one big line in a Figma file so I can see all of the onboardings, every question they ask, every graph they have. and I'll pick out all the ones that I like and I'll grab some from one, some from another, and then I'll redesign them so all have my theme and my aesthetic that I want for my app. I think it's really important to have an extensive onboarding. Realistically, 90% of users will probably only ever see your onboarding if you have a paywalled section in your app. So, I think it's really important that you spend a lot of time on this, maybe even as much time as designing the actual functionality of the app. When it comes to the onboarding, these are the most important things that you want to do to make sure that your app converts successfully. The first one is you want to invoke emotion. You want to make sure that when the user is going through the onboarding, they feel [music] strongly about it. Most purchases are made emotionally and are not logical when it comes to consumers. You also want to make sure that you show the strongest incentives of your app, how it's going to improve your users's life. You want to make sure that they understand the benefits and that it's very simple for them to be able to make that purchase. It's also important to make sure that the app feels personalized. In today's day and age when there's so much competition, people want to make sure that what they're buying feels like it's meant for them specifically rather than just like a generally applicable app. Finally, you want to make sure that you have some sort of charts, graphs, something to make the app feel more scientific. People like to know that something that they're using has been proven to work, that other people have successfully used it. And by adding these charts and graphs, it'll make it so your app seems very legitimate. The next step is you're going to want to design your data structures. This is very important specifically for vibe coding. It's important to know what your data is going to look like, how it's shaped. Because when you feed the AI, such as cursor or claw, it'll make it much more simple for the AI to know what exactly you're trying to build so it doesn't have to make any guesses on what you're trying to make. I recommend making a text document with an explanation as well as some JSON data that explains what your data actually looks like and some information about each of the attributes that you're going to have for your data. By giving it this text document in advance, it allows me to code this thing very quickly. With this prep done, you can actually start to build the app. Usually, I'd start with building the core functionality of the app, skipping the onboarding and just going straight for the main features of the app. You can really just drop the screenshots into Claude or Cursor, whatever AI you're using. And because it's now able to read the images and understand what it's looking at, it'll actually be able to write the code for the full screen for you. When working with AI, it doesn't always get everything right on the first time. So, sometimes you need to just continue to work with it and eventually it'll get the details correct. I don't recommend being too picky because it's important to get a version out quickly rather than getting a perfect app out. As far as the tools that I use now, I honestly just use Claude. That's the only thing I'm using for AI coding and it does everything for me. &gt;&gt; It is absolutely insane that Connor was able to build and launch this app in just a few weeks. I hope that his story inspires a lot of people watching to get started and vibe code stuff as well. However, I need you to be careful. I see a lot of people get into vibe coding, try to oneshot something real quick, get lost, not be able to deploy, and then give up. Cuz here's the truth about building with AI. You need to know how to use these AI [music] tools effectively. What to build, how to ship fast, and how to build something that actually works. Well, this is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build, which is our program where you will learn how to launch your project using only AI coding tools and do it in just a couple weeks. Once you understand how to actually leverage these AI tools, you can build [music] a lot faster and save a whole lot of time. So, if you're ready to learn how to build apps the right way with AI. Well, head to the first link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. Our next cohort is starting this week, so definitely check out that link and save your spot. All right, let's get back to the video. The next question I have for you is around validation. You've built multiple apps that are really successful, and I know you've also built some stuff that wasn't successful as well. Looking back, how do you know if your app idea is validated and it's worth taking it the distance? &gt;&gt; So, the way I see it is there's two different types of apps. There's innovating new ideas and there's modifying versions of existing ideas. If you're creating a modified version of an existing app, then congrats, your app is already validated by other people. Now, all you have to do is make some modifications and make it so the app feels like it's your own. The other option is when you're making something brand new. What I'd usually do when I'm making something brand new is go look on Tik Tok, Instagram, see if anyone's talking about the problem that you're trying to solve. [music] You want to make sure that there's an easy path for you to market this app by looking at the comments and seeing like are people asking questions asking like how do I solve this problem? Then now with the current state of how fast you can build apps, I actually will skip the weightless steps and just go ahead and build the app. I really believe that any app can make thousands of dollars these days. Your idea doesn't have to be some crazy app that changes society to make a couple thousand dollars. There's hundreds of millions of people in the US alone. And if you can even capture a tiny grain [music] of sand out of that, then you can make more than enough to sustain yourself. &gt;&gt; I agree with that, too. There are so many apps out there that are crushing it that we don't even know about. It's pretty insane what's possible today. But as we know, building it is not enough. We have to focus on one very important thing, which is distribution. My next question for you is around marketing. What was your playbook to grow this app from 0 to $20,000 a month in 50 days? And what is your general playbook for marketing apps? For this app, there was a couple different tactics that I used to get the app off the ground. The first one was influencer campaigns. This is when you work with an influencer and have them promote the app or their already existing audience. If you can work with an influencer and get them to promote your product, people already have some degree of trust for that influencer, then they're more likely to listen to their recommendation. For this app, I partnered with a content creator that was already in the niche for the app I was building, and his videos were able to drive a bunch of traffic to the app, [music] like thousands of downloads. The goal is to create relatable, viral content about your app that comes off as natural and unprocessed. Once one of these videos starts to perform well, you can get more videos like that made with other creators so you can have people just repeat formats [music] that are working for you. One of the major benefits of running these UGC campaigns is that as these creators produce content, you're building out the library of ads that you can run in the future. And you already know relatively how good the performance will be on ads based on how well it did organically. And my goal is to always get my app to the point where I can run paid ads. It's the most consistent way to drive revenue growth to your app. Recently, the paid ads algorithm has changed. Facebook is trying to balance two things. They want to make sure that the advertisers are happy with their results while also keeping people on the platform by making sure the videos are entertaining. The more entertaining your video is, the cheaper it'll be to get your video put in front of people, but you also want to make sure that you're driving conversions. So, your ad has to also make sure that it pushes your product. So, it's important to find that balance between having a video that's very entertaining and also has the potential to convert. Thank you for sharing all those growth tactics. I think that might be the most important part. We haven't really talked too much about what your app actually does. Would you be able to show us a quick demo of your onboarding and how your app works? &gt;&gt; So, my app is called Payout. It's a class action lawsuit discovery app that lets people find class action lawsuits that they already are applicable for. And this is basically just a way for people to get some money from companies that have done something wrong. So, for the onboarding, I'll quickly run through it here. Asking for activity notifications. You can see the social proof. Here's the payw wall. This payw wall has been converting really well. You can see that I have a weekly and a yearly option here. And the goal is to prioritize users to get the yearly option since it has the highest lifetime value per customer. Here's the main feature of the app. It's a list of class action lawsuits that you can check and see if you're applicable for. For example, this one is the NBA Top Shot app. They had a privacy settlement over the Metapixel being on their website. You can see the description requirements of who's applicable for this lawsuit. You can press the get started button and fill form. And this will take you to a form that you can fill out, put all of your information in, and have everything ready to go to mail this in and claim your class action settlement. And you can see the app will prepare the PDF ready for you to mail in. There's also the wallet tab where you can keep track of all the class action lawsuits that you're applying for and your forms tab where you can see all the forms that you've already filled out. &gt;&gt; Okay. I mean, that's a really cool idea for an app. I think anybody watching this right now probably wants to go on there and check and see if they're owed any money from these class action lawsuits. What is it about this app that really makes it work? Why do you think it did 0 to 20k a month so fast? &gt;&gt; I think the value proposition for this app is just very obvious. There's some core things that all people want. They want to be healthier. They want to make more money. They want to look attractive. All sorts of things like this. I like to make apps that tap into these core human desires. And I think that anybody that wants to build apps should be doing the same. And this one plays into people want to make more money. So, it's very easy for people to invest money into an app that they know will make them more money. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, I want to change topics a little bit and understand how you built this app. What tech stack do you use and what tools do you use to run this business? &gt;&gt; I use Figma for UI design, app store screenshots, and making the app icon. I use Mixpanel for analytics. I use Claude Code for vibe coding. For the more technical stuff, I'll use Nex.js and TypeScript for my website and backend. I use Versell for hosting. I use GitHub for version control as well as making it easier to host. I use Expo for crossplatform build management. And I use Revenue Cap for subscription analytics and pricing testing. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Thanks for sharing. That's a pretty simple stack you got there. I like that. The last question that I have for you that I ask everyone who comes on to Starter Story. What advice would you have for anyone watching this that wants to build apps like you? You've built a bunch of successful stuff. You built some failed things. What would be your number one piece of advice on getting started today? &gt;&gt; My number one piece of advice would be to build something simple with a great onboarding. A simple app can make lots of money. You only really need one to three good features and your onboarding will pull most of the weight for you. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, that's great advice. Thank you, Connor, for coming on. I love what you built. Amazing stuff you shared here. Thanks for coming on and sharing everything. &gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for having me. &gt;&gt; All right. I want to thank Connor for coming on to the channel. I hope this video finally gives you the proof that you can build apps in a matter of weeks that grow really, really fast. This video was the playbook here on how to do it. And we're showing you the real actual app that he did it with. If you're ready to launch your app, then definitely check out Starter Story [music] Build. We will help take your idea, turn it into a real app, get it in front of real people using only AI tools. If you're ready to get off the sidelines and launch, head to the link in the description and check out Starter Story Build. I promise you won't regret it. All right, that's it for this episode. Thank you guys for watching. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: How I built a $30K/month mobile app
VIDEO ID: T5zMsTw8GWQ
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5zMsTw8GWQ
================================================================================

My app has been downloaded 5 million times and I did it all by myself. &gt;&gt; This is John Makavoy, a gentleman from Scotland who taught himself how to code and built [music] something incredible. &gt;&gt; I had a problem I needed to solve, so I built it. &gt;&gt; But here's what's even crazier. His app has been downloaded over 5 million times thanks to one simple strategy that costs him $0. &gt;&gt; App Store optimization, it's really just about research and patience. &gt;&gt; I asked John to come on to the channel and he shared everything. And in this video, we'll go over the app that makes him $30,000 a month. His advice for finding great app ideas and the simple and free strategy that helped him hit 5 million downloads. All right, this one's going to be fun. Let's dive in. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. Okay, welcome John from Scotland. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; I built an app called Mumigo. It is a bus and train tracking app. It covers over 160 cities. So, it's been downloaded about just over 5 million times so far since 2017. I did it all solo with no previous developer experience. &gt;&gt; Okay, John. I mean, you're one guy who built an app that's used by millions of people. I think that's crazy. Can you share some of the numbers behind this app, behind what you built? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, right now it's around $30,000 monthly recurring revenue. Pretty much all of that subscription based. Total number of downloads is around 5.2 million at the moment. The monthly active users is around 400,000 with around 75,000 ratings so far. &gt;&gt; All right. I mean, that's crazy. You did this without developer experience. Can you tell me a little bit more about your background and how you even got to a point where you could build an app like this? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so I started my career in graphic design and as I started my career more and more I was a bit just more curious about development. So, JavaScript, backend systems, databases. It's just this curiosity about being able to make something out of nothing, creating software that just works and could be used by so many people. &gt;&gt; That's amazing. It reminds me of my story. Just it's so cool to build something and know that someone out there in the world is using it. Let's fast forward a little bit to the app that you actually built. How did you even get the idea for an app like this? &gt;&gt; At the time, I was working for a bus company in Edinburgh in Scotland. I wanted a way to see where the a bus was on a map. Uber had just come out. It was such a a thrill to be able to see a taxi coming along a map towards you. And I wanted to have the same experience waiting for a bus. I wanted something that would allow me to finish having my coffee in the morning without having to stand at a bus stop for 10 20 minutes in the [music] rain. And that was the initial idea behind the app. For any developer, any idea you have has to be something that you a problem that you yourself have and if it works for you, there's a good chance it'll work for lots of other people. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you mentioned you came from a designer background and you essentially taught yourself how to code your your sort of self-taught. So, tell me about how you actually built this thing. What was the build journey to turn basically no coding knowledge into a pretty pretty legit complicated app? First of all, I started off with just creating designs in Illustrator. And once that was done, I started chipping away bit by [music] bit at the development side. At this point, I didn't have any experience with smartphone app development. [music] I turned to some of some of my coding experience in the past for websites. And so, the first few versions of the app were built in Zamarind that uses car.net. That's what I was comfortable with at the time. It was a really tough process because the paradigm of creating an iOS and Android app is so different from creating a website. It was, you know, months of building, failing, tweaking, and once it [music] was launched, I was able to spend some time making the code better because it was a mess. At this point, Swift had been around for a few years, and Flutter had just just been released. So, I took a few months to rebuild the app in native Swift on iOS. And because of the way the app works with maps and sliding panels, Flutter was perfect. So was able to rebuild very quickly [music] within two or three months. &gt;&gt; Cool. Well, nowadays you can pretty much do all that with AI tools in uh in three days. Uh which is funny to look back at how much really had to go into building apps. When we chatted earlier, you let me know about this one thing that really took your app to the next level. Can you tell me what that was? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's it's called app store optimization. And this is the process [music] of finding specific phrases that people are searching for and including those in your app title, subtitle, and keyword list in order that when people search that sentence, that phrase, your app comes up first. &gt;&gt; Okay. App store optimization. Can you break down what actually worked for you, how you got your app used by millions of people for essentially free? Can you give me this playbook right now? &gt;&gt; Okay. With app store optimization, there are three basic steps. Step one, you want to find, in this [music] case, location specific keywords, things like New York subway, Chicago train. Add those to the title and metadata of the app. That will start process of the appearing in searches for those specific keywords. But it wasn't until I did some research that growth really happened. First of all, I can see that different cities use different terminology. So, for example, in New York, you've got the MTA subway. In Chicago, you have the CTA L train. Once I started adding these kind of keywords, [music] I found that downloads increased substantially. At the same time, also updated screenshots, so they're much more locationsp specific. So each localization would have its own set of screenshots to hone in on the fact that this app works for where you are right now. The next step was to use other localizations. So, for example, if you were to add keywords to Mexican Spanish, those same keywords would be indexed for the US app store and have the same weight as [music] the native US English localization. Step two was to find more keywords that worked. You have two choices. You can use Apple Search Ads, start testing a few keywords at a time to see which ones convert, or using the app store itself. Search for terms, keywords, and phrases around what your app does by typing in the first few characters into search. You'll see a list come up, and most people when you start typing, we'll see the list appear and tap on the first or second entry. So, by looking at those lists, I was able to determine what are the most high impact keywords people are searching for. And the best thing about this is is because they are very specific, they don't have a huge popularity. So by targeting those keywords specifically in the right place at the right time, you can quite easily get into [music] the top five for a keyword. And step three, asking for ratings within the [music] app. At this point, you should be at the top 10 for the keywords you're looking to target. If an app wants to get to number one, it needs ratings [music] coming in all the time. You need to have golden moments where you can ask for a rating. This case, it could be when you tap on a stop and see a live tracking of a bus or train. you can actually see it moving on the map. That's a great moment to ask the customer for a rating where the customer is most likely to respond positively. If you can get those ratings coming in, your app will rise organically to the top for all the keywords that you're targeting. &gt;&gt; Now, here's something I love about John's story. John didn't just build a cool app. He built a real business. That means dealing with taxes, bookkeeping, and all the admin stuff that has nothing to do with actually building. So many solo founders like John trip up on this part [music] and put it off until it becomes a mess. Well, that's where Doula comes in. Doula helps you set up your LLC, handle your bookkeeping, and stay tax compliant all in one place. It's basically like having an ops team without the overhead. They don't just hand you a checklist and leave you to figure it all out. They actually stick with you and make sure you're set up for success from day [music] one. Thousands of entrepreneurs in over 175 countries use Doula because it actually works. [music] So, let Doula handle the boring stuff for you so you can focus on what actually matters in building your business. If you're starting something right now, just head to the first link in the description and use code starter [music] story for 10% off. Thank you to Doula for supporting the channel. All right, let's get back to the story. Let's switch topics a little bit to the growth of an app like this. I really want to understand what it takes to grow an app like yours from zero to $30,000 a month. Can you walk me through kind of the journey there? &gt;&gt; For the first couple of years, more and more downloads were coming in and I started to monetize using banner ads. It was making around say $8,000 a month, but then the pandemic hit and suddenly my ad revenue just disappeared. [music] I knew I needed to pivot quickly. At this point, subscriptions were becoming more mainstream. So I rebuilt the app with subscriptions in mind with premium features that would entice people to pay on an annual basis. In August 2020 that new update was released and over the next year it grew and grew and eventually replaced the missing ad revenue. But in 2021 this is when the real growth happened because finally started to use AB testing. I started creating different pay walls to see which one performed better. And over the course of maybe two or three months with maybe 10 experiments, I was able to increase the conversion rate from 0.5% all the way up to 8%. Just by optimizing the onboarding and pay wall, and suddenly growth skyrocketed, going from around 8K a month to over $30,000. Okay, John, I would love to actually see your app. Would you be able to give us a quick demo of what your app actually does? I'd also love if you showed us this kind of onboarding payw wall thing that you mentioned sort of changed the business as well when you made that big pivot. Could you show us the app? &gt;&gt; Okay, this is uh the first launch of the app and it's really designed to very quickly show the value of the app because most people who are downloading and installing the app are doing so at a bus stop or a train station. So, it's no time for a a 20 screen onboarding. First of all, quickly ask for your location cuz that's one of the most important permissions for this app. And then shows you a few kind of screens about what you're going to get from this app. Not just bus tracking, but all the extra features. And this is kind of setting it up for the pay walls to come. It kind of shows a bit of social proof, right? It says [music] join millions, saving time. And this gets a customer prepared. And that is the pay wall itself. It's got three different options. 7-day [music] free trial for a yearly plan. You have a weekly plan for a low commitment. And for people who just don't like subscriptions, you've got a lifetime plan. [music] Now, the great thing here is after a lot of experimentation, what I've found is a real unlock is for people who just tap on the close button. The app starts at a reverse trial. So, if I close it just now, it says enjoy a week of pro on us. And now you have 7 days free trial of all the pro features starts without you having to pay or without you having to make any kind of commitment. At this [music] point, you got a few screens showing what you get from Pro, showing off all all the all the little details. Finally, you're in the app. And now can see everything around me. I can just uh move around the map. And I've just choose a little bus stop here. And what I can do here is I can just tap on the departure. And this is real magic moment. This is where you can actually see the bus on the map. It's moving. And if I tap on go, it will turn on trip assist. [music] And then at that point, it won't just track where I am. I've got machine learning set up on the server that will keep track of my what's happening up ahead on my journey. So if if there's a train or bus that's delayed or I'm going to miss a connection, the server would know and send me a notification and offer me an alternative route. And that's the real kind of magic of the app. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, the other question I have for you is what is this built on? Like what what tech and what stack is this app built on? Right now &gt;&gt; with this app, I go for old and boring. Laravel PHP for the back end and for all kind of marketing materials the kind of UI of the app graphics it's just Adobe creative suite I use Lotty quite a lot for things like animations I would create an animation in After Effects and convert it into Lotty for inclusion within the app for ASO research I tend to go for app figures revenue cut is fantastic for subscription management and the biggest unlock for me is using event analytics I use mix panel I use Cloudflare for a kind of geographic load balancer [music] and that costs around $90 a month. I do use chat GPT for pretty much everything and that's around $20 a month. &gt;&gt; On that same note, could you also share some of the costs to run this business? I understand you're just one guy running it here. What are some of the tools you're paying for? What are the margins look like on this? &gt;&gt; The biggest cost for me are servers. So, I run about 20 dedicated servers. That costs around $2,500 a month. But various get thirdparty APIs like mapping. That's why $1,000 a month. &gt;&gt; Okay, last question that we ask everyone who comes on the Starter Story channel. If you could stand on John's shoulders when you're just starting out, back when you're a graphic designer, or for anyone watching this right now, what would be your advice for anyone starting a mobile app like you in 2025? &gt;&gt; Two things. Number one, you need to solve a problem that you have because when you're working [music] nights and weekends, you're hitting walls all the time. you need something to keep you going. And solving your own problem is probably the best way to get past that block each time. And secondly, for the first couple of years, I was relying on kind of vanity metrics to see how well I was doing things like monthly active users. That wasn't really moving the needle. It was only when I moved to eventbased analytics that growth really happened. Being able to set up AB tests for different pay walls to see which one is more effective by trusting the data that you get from these kind of analytics, you will have a much better idea of who your customers are and what they want. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, that was great advice. Thank you for sharing that, John. What you built is awesome. I think it's amazing that you built something by yourself that's used by millions of people. I think it's amazing. So, thanks for coming on, sharing everything, especially all that cool stuff about app store optimization. Thanks for coming on. &gt;&gt; It's been my pleasure. Thanks to John for coming on to the channel and sharing his strategy. I think it's insane that someone like John from Scotland can come up with an idea, build it, and then 5 [music] million people can use it and love it and it can make money. That's just amazing. That's what Starter Story is all about. And this is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build, where we will help you take your idea and turn it into a real app [music] using only AI tools. So, if you're ready to launch your project just like John did, head to the link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. All right, that's it for this episode. Thank you guys for watching. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: I Found a Business for Sale and Rebuilt It Into $20K/Month
VIDEO ID: 4BsxnGRbF4k

================================================================================

The number one question I get is, "How do I come up with a good business idea?" But the truth is, you don't have to. And this video is proof. Meet Adrian, a solo developer from Austin who had a different approach. I copied a successful app and now it makes me $20,000 a month. &gt;&gt; A year ago, he saw a successful app for sale, but instead of buying it, he rebuilt it himself and now it makes &gt;&gt; If something is working, you have a moral obligation to copy it. I invited Adrian onto the channel to share exactly how he did it, including the specific platform he used to find proven ideas, his method to validate if an idea is worth copying, and the playbook he would use if he had to start over again today. If you've been looking for the right business idea, this episode might change everything for you. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. All right, Adrian, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; Hey, my name is Adrian. I'm a soloreneur. I built a SAS to 20K a month. And I found this idea not by coming up with something new, but rather I copied a successful app I found on an online business brokerage and built it myself. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. So, you built this API doing $20,000 a month. Can you share a little bit more about some of the numbers behind it? &gt;&gt; Sure. Yeah, so monthly revenue is about 20,000 a month right now. And it is a credit based model. So you just pay for credits and then use them. There's no subscription. So right now we have 600 people who have paid but aren't necessarily paying on a regular basis. We do almost like 20 million API requests a month right now. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Before we get into how you found this idea and kind of the genius way that I think you did it. I do want to understand a little bit more about your background. How do you get to the point where you build a SAS like this? &gt;&gt; So I moved to SF wanting to be a part of tech, learn how to code at this program called App Academy. It was a code boot camp. Then got a job in Utah as an engineer for 3 years, always with the goal of starting my own business. Then quit with $30,000 in savings and then freelanced, built a course, built some products, but didn't have success until I stuck with this one thing, which was scrape creators. And then here we are now. All right, Adrian, what I love about your story is how you came up with this idea and how you validated that this was something that was worth building. Before we get into all that, can you share how you even come across the idea to build a web scraping API? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. One of my followers on Twitter actually DM'd me telling me to check out this listing for Micro Acquire or Acquire.com. And it was a scraping API. And the reason that he DM' me that is because I already had a product that had to do with social media. So, he thought that I might be interested in checking it out. Once I did, I saw the numbers and was completely blown away. I had no confidence myself that a scraping API could make that much money. the fact that they were only getting their customers through SEO. I thought this is the product for me. I'm going to do this exact same thing. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you see this idea on Micro Acquire, which lists business for sale. You can kind of see how much money is making or how much the business is worth. How do you know that this is something that you could replicate and could potentially be successful? &gt;&gt; Well, a couple of different things. One, I had this skill set because I had been studying scraping for 3 years. So, I had already kind of built those APIs that were hosted on this website. So technically, I had the confidence that I could build it. And then the reason that I thought I could make money off of it was because they were doing 30,000 monthly recurring. They were around for 3 years, only got their customers from SEO, and they had less than 100 customers. So doing that math in my head, I was like, I could probably do that. And I have a little bit of a presence on Twitter. So even if I just message people on Twitter, I probably could get there even without SEO. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well, you find this idea. You think that is something that you could potentially replicate. How do you go about building this? &gt;&gt; So I am a NodeJS developer. Everything is written in JavaScript. So really it was just a matter of hosting the APIs like on a server. So I had them all in one of my repos. So put those scrapers on a Node.js server on render.com. So then hosted the API there. For the documentation, I just put that actually in a notion doc and then a basic website and then that was it. So, it was pretty uh bare bones and it probably took uh just a couple of weeks because I had built that experience and those scrapers for my previous three years of experience and got my first customer a few weeks later. Okay. So, you build this, you get your first customer pretty quickly. I think a lot of people watching this may be similar to you software developer. They have the skills to build something like this. But the hard part is getting customers, growing, scaling this and replicating what this business that you sort of cloned had already done. So, how did you grow this business? How did you get customers? &gt;&gt; Uh, I hang out on Twitter a lot, so people see me there. People have seen my content. My first customer was just because I scraped a company's site and then the CTO actually commented on that post. So, completely accident. And then also, anytime someone has a launch video that has anything to do with scraping social media, then I comment saying, "Hey, I'll give you 10K free credits if you'll try my API." But the great thing about a scraping API also is that you don't have to have a lot of customers to have a decent MR. So I have maybe like 12 who pay for the majority of that MR. &gt;&gt; I love Adrian's strategy for copying successful apps. But here's the thing, he didn't just copy the idea. He got creative and made his idea 1% better than the rest. Nowadays, this creative edge is what separates winners from everyone else. And this is where the HubSpot for Startups Creative AI use cases database comes in handy. It's a free database with over 100 creative ways to use AI in your business. These aren't the obvious AI apps that everyone's already building. These are the creative uses your competitors haven't discovered yet that can give you an unfair advantage. My favorite part is the fact that they break down the list by difficulty, business impact, and even steps on how to get started with which tools. Just find the one that resonates with you and run with it. So, if you're ready to join Adrian and start your own SAS business, then download the free AI differentiation database at the first link right below in the description. Thank you to HubSpot for Startups for sponsoring this video. Now, let's get back into it. I want to understand a little bit more about this framework. If you were to start over today in 2025 and go to Microacquire and find another idea, how would you do that? For people watching, can you break it down step by step? All right, this will be my playbook if I was doing this again. Step one, you're going to visit the micro acquire marketplace. Step two, filter by SAS. And then step three, filter by asking price. So, we're not looking for apps that aren't making any money. That's not great. We're looking for pre-validated ideas. So, increase that asking price to at least 300,000 or you can filter by annual recurring revenue, whatever you want. All right, step four. You're going to look for things that you would be good at or a market that you would know about. For example, I knew I wanted to build a product that had something to do with web scraping. That was my niche. I was niching down for that. You would want to build a product that you have some sort of knowledge about. All right, step five. We're going to try to find the website. Obviously, on Microquire, they don't list what the website is, but we're going to reverse engineer and try to find the actual website. So, a lot of these SAS businesses are really easy to find because you can just Google what they have in their listing. So in the title or description, you can just Google part of that and usually they're using like their title or H1 or description actually in the micro acquire description. So it's pretty easy to find or they actually list competitors if you scroll down. So all you have to do a lot of times the website will write blog posts or pages that will say competitor name and then alternative. So all you need to Google is the competitor and then alternative or alternatives. One of those two ways will get you to the site and then you can just view the site and see if the copy is similar. Then boom, you got the site. All right, step six. Try to reverse engineer how they acquired customers. This is arguably the most important part. Not so hard to build the product, but how are they getting customers? So, for example, the app that I was copying, I knew that they got their customers mostly from SEO. Read everything that you can on the site, any information that they talk about how they're acquiring customers. Try to look up like the founder on Twitter, LinkedIn. Try to find podcasts or YouTube videos, any way that they talk about the product or how to grow the product. Step seven, actually build the damn thing. Step eight, yeah, this is just don't copy word for word. Don't copy everything literally exactly. You just want to copy the concept, the idea. Step nine, don't get distracted with other projects. Do something every single day to promote or improve the product. You know that this idea is making money. So now you just have to execute. do something every single day to build the product or market it and I guarantee you will make money. You will be successful. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks Adrian for sharing that full playbook. I think that's awesome. We haven't really talked yet about what your API does specifically. You have this sort of micro SASS API. Can you just share what it does, how it works, what type of customers use it? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so it scrapes specifically social media that can be Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, uh and then we just scrape public data. Got to say that for the lawyers out there. We scrape social media as well as like their ad libraries as well. So the Facebook ad library, LinkedIn ad library, etc. And this obviously helps developers because scraping is a pain in the butt. So we scrape so you don't have to. We handle all the infrastructure, proxy rotation, etc. And who uses this tool is a lot of like link and bio tools. Anyone who's tracking analytics like short form content. Yeah. So it's a credit based system. So pay as you go. So we have three payment plans right now. $10 for 5,000 credits, $50 for 25,000, and then 500,000 credits for $500. I think it does well because it works. Like there's a lot of scrapers out there, like social media in particular, that break pretty often. So with mine, I think people like it because it's reliable and then if it's not reliable, then I'll communicate with people pretty frequently as well, as well as it's really easy to get a hold of me. Whereas a lot of developers who build these sort of things, you don't even have their email or a way to contact them. Um, so I think that is also helpful. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's change topics a little bit. I want to understand techstack. You're a developer. You have a scraping pretty technical type of product. How did you build this? What's your tech stack? &gt;&gt; Yeah, honestly, it's pretty straightforward, pretty easy. So everything is written in Node.js JavaScript and it's just a bunch of HTTP requests. So one important thing that I use is this package called impit. It's developed by ampify. So another scraping framework. So you npm install input use that for HTTP requests and then just a lot of proxies. So I have four main ones that I use which are Evomi core residential which are the cheapest residential out there do webshare and massive and then I host everything on render.com or I host subscripts on AWS Lambda obviously I use cursor so that's 20 bucks a month and then superbase for the database and then the front end is astro uh plus react &gt;&gt; and on a similar note I'm also curious what are the costs to use all these tools what does the profit margin look like for your business &gt;&gt; yeah margin is about 80% Most of it is spent on proxies. So about $1,500 a month right now is spent on proxies. And I hire a developer in the Philippines to monitor the API for outages at night. So he's about $500. And then server costs are about $400. Okay, cool. Thank you for sharing that. Thank you for being transparent about all that. That's awesome. Last question that I want to ask. We ask everyone who comes on Starter Story, what would be your advice for anyone watching this starting out in 2025 about how to do something like you've done? Stop bouncing around ideas and just pick one thing. Do it every single day. Focus on it every single day and you'll make it. Stop getting distracted because that's exactly what happened to me. &gt;&gt; Cool. That's amazing. Adrian, thank you for coming on. Thank you for sharing all this, being super transparent. I love the business you built. Thanks for coming on and sharing everything. &gt;&gt; Thanks, man. Appreciate it. &gt;&gt; Big thanks to Adrian for coming on to the channel. I love his story because it flips the startup myth on its head. Adrien didn't need to invent something brand new. He just saw a model. He copied it and he executed better and that turned into a SAS that makes $20,000 a month and effectively changed his life. I think the lesson that anyone can take from this is stop waiting for that genius idea. Just start, build, and keep improving. And you never know what might happen. This is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build, where we will show you how to take your idea, use AI to build it fast, and launch in just a couple weeks. Even if you're starting with no team, no money, and no clear idea, if you want to finally build your first app, launch it, and potentially turn it into a profitable business, well, head to the first link in the description and check out Starter Story Build. That's it for this episode, guys. Thank you for watching. I hope you enjoyed it. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: My app failed, then I changed one thing, and made $80K
VIDEO ID: hYW9YDwHE20
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYW9YDwHE20
================================================================================

After launching my app and seeing no success, I rebuilt it and it made $80,000 in 6 months. Meet Prren, a builder from India who quit his software engineering job to go allin on building apps. But after launching the first version of his app, he saw pretty much no success. So he decided to make a simple pivot that changed everything. &gt;&gt; I was making 250k a year but always knew I wanted to build my own thing. &gt;&gt; In this video, Pren will share what most builders get wrong about their first idea. the pricing change that made him $80,000 in six months and specifically how you can price your first product so you can make money on day one. &gt;&gt; I would not recommend starting with a subscription model if you're bootstrapping. &gt;&gt; This one is going to be fun. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. Prrenit, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; My name is Prrenit and I quit my $250,000 job last year and went all in on building my own apps. I built an app called Canvas Mode which was formerly known as Rabbit Holes AI. But when I built the first version of it, it didn't get any traction. But then I changed the pricing model and my app paid $80,000 in the last 6 months. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, before we get into that pricing change, which I'm really excited to talk about. I do want to understand what is your business? What is Rabbit Holes? &gt;&gt; Rabbit Holes AI is an app which is basically a canvas first way to interact with AI models. If you ever chatted with Chad GPT for a really long time, it tends to kind of forget or lose its place in the conversation. So it's really hard to have any meaningful long conversations with a linear app like chat GPT. So what happens in a canvas app like this is as soon as you see something is kind of getting interesting and you want to branch off or create a different kind of fork in that conversation you could do that by creating a new node. So rabbit holes AI it's built for power AI users to get more out of the AI unlike linear conversation apps. &gt;&gt; Okay let's talk about how you came up with the idea for this. Obviously this app is huge has lots of users. How did you find the idea to build this? I was initially trying to work on build on one of my old ideas and I was using chat GPD and I was using perplexity and I was using cloud to do that to teach myself but soon I found myself like distributed across a bunch of different tabs each one of those had different kind of expertise cloud was much better for coding and GPT was much better for high level architectural kind of things and uh perplexity was much better for real-time information so the UX designer in me thought okay this is a frictionless experience and this is kind of broken and if it's it's going to be much better if I can do it all in one tab and it kind of evolved as a design from there. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you have this idea, you start building it, but you sort of make almost a mistake when you start building it in terms of the pricing model. Can you tell me about when you started building it, what your plan was for how to price this thing and kind of how that whole process started. &gt;&gt; The default mode of how I operated without building products was the typical subscription model or the premium model. So that's where I went with initially and launched a web app with free trial where you get like a few questions for free and then you have to pay after a little bit of usage but that didn't get much traction and I feel like there's multiple reasons to that. The top ones are that I did not have a huge personal brand trying to do the build public thing where I was talking on Twitter or kind of posting everywhere where I got a chance. I got some interest but never really turned into any real dollars. And on top of it, I kind of decided that my ideal customer profile, ICP, is a Power AI user. So at that point, my ICP would already be saturated with bunch of different subscriptions. They were paying for these multiple AI model. So that's when I had to change the product a little bit by moving away from web app into a desktop app and uh making it a one-time purchase. Okay. So you have this app, it's sort of working. You've got some users, you got free trials, but you feel like there's maybe something missing and you make a change. Tell me about what that change was and what happened after you made that change. &gt;&gt; To balance all the things that were particular to my situation, I wanted to start with a one-time purchase and I had to convert the app into a onetime purchase which means that I cannot incur any AI cost because AI usage cost me money and I wanted to offload that to the users. So that was step one to make it bring your own keys and the second step was to not even incur any server cost. if I were to like just build it once and sell it many times. I had to offload my server cost to the users as well. And the easiest way to do that was to just use the users computers and to do that I had to build a desktop app. This allows me to like ship and forget about my business cost and everything ran on the users. They paid for the AI. As soon as they changed it, a lot of people actually started paying. They were more serious in terms of giving feedback. felt much more refreshing in the sense that people were not only more serious but they were also more helpful in kind of like believing in this early stage product. So after we moved to a onetime purchase model that change led to about $80,000 in the last 6 months. &gt;&gt; Okay. So for anyone watching this I do want to reiterate that a lifetime deal doesn't make sense for all businesses. So I'd like to hear from you when does a lifetime deal make sense? What type of business and what type of founder is this for? I think every bootstrap business should do an LTD model. The pricing and how they do it should obviously vary according to their unique product use cases and the cost that they incur. But I think a VC style of doing premium would not work for a bootstrap model. Having venture capital would actually mean that you can offset your truth seeeking in a sense like you can kind of delay your product market fit. So you can kind of hope that people would come on board but that's not a luxury that bootstrap businesses would have. So almost every bootstrap business should do a lifetime deal along with whatever they are doing. If you already have like a subscription model, have a lifetime deal. Even if it's a limited thing, have it because it kind of gives you this boost in morale with this chunk of cash coming in and you have a much more validated idea and you have a good sizable user base who are willing to actively give feedback and be involved. And it's hugely hugely beneficial if you're a solo founder or like a founder with like a small team trying to figure out what to build because usually what happens which happened with me in the past as well was that you kind of get into your own head and trying to think what to build and what not to build. All right, before we get into how Pren successfully pivoted and relaunched his business, I do need to point something out. Making money online isn't as complicated as most people think. At its core, it's as simple as creating something valuable and putting a Stripe payment link on it. No, it won't always work, but you'll never know unless you ship it. And that's the beauty of the internet today. There are almost no barriers to trying. And this is why we created Starter Story Build. It's our actionoriented boot camp where in just a couple of weeks, you'll come up with an idea, you'll build it with AI tools, and you'll actually launch it to the real world. Even if you have no coding experience or you're still working a full-time job, there has never been a better time to just try. So, if you're ready to take action, click the first link in the description to learn more about Starter Story Build. All right, now back to Pren's story. The next question I have is more specific and tactical is the pricing of lifetime deal. How did you price your lifetime deal? And how would you recommend anybody who's got similar products to price a lifetime deal? &gt;&gt; If you are building an AI product, I think it's absolutely worth it to have a bring your own keys model that offsets a lot of costs and it kind of offloads it from you to the user. So, everybody should do that. The way I've done that for rabbit holes is that the pricing of the actual product actually started with something really small. I started off with $29 when I was under 100 users. Once it crossed 100, I bumped it to like 49 and we are going to be bumping the lifetime deal much higher and kind of moving on to a recurring model now that we are about 1,200 users right now. So the initial offering was much lower and the early users who bought in got in a much better deal and it also gave me feedback of like that the market is wanting to buy something like this. &gt;&gt; On that tactical note, I do also want to talk about growth. Yes, you can create a lifetime deal and you can set your pricing but you still need to drive users to the page. You still need to get it in front of people. How did you grow rabbit holes and what was your growth strategies? &gt;&gt; One of the first things I would still want people to do is to get their landing page right. Um, to get that right, I need to think this is something that I've done in my past experiments, but this time I've done it right, which is to get my ICP correct. In my case, it was Power AI users. So, my landing page copy was like completely tailored to Power AI users. I call them out in my H1 and I call them out in multiple places on my website. And this is very important. And there's like tons of places where you can find how to structure your website. And after I've done that, I started like talking more about it on Twitter and I kind of like replied to conversations that were in relation to AI interactions and the new age of AI and it was not just directly talking about my product in a sense like you know buy my product or I'm building this in that sense but I was just hinting towards something related to my product. &gt;&gt; On that note, I'd love to hear just some of the numbers of the business today. What does the business look like revenue, profit, users? What can you share? It's like around 80kish in gross revenue as we speak and about 75 around the profits and minus the refunds and everything. We have about like 200 underpaying users and 60% of them are lifetime users and about 40% are like people who bought it out of one-time purchase where they would have to renew it after a year to get more updates. And uh overall we have about like 38,000 unique visitors to the site so far. &gt;&gt; Well, thanks for sharing that. On that same note, tell me about tech stack. How did you actually build this? &gt;&gt; I was saying in the beginning I used AI as my co-founder in a sense and I used cursor for coding. The landing page is built on Nex.js. The actual app is an electron app and it's uses React underneath and um TypeScript to do it and do host the apps on CloudFare but that's not a huge deal. But another big thing I have to talk about or touch on is the AI SDK that is built by people at Versel. And it's a huge accelerant in me being able to build this product because it allowed me to build a product with great abstraction where I could just focus on the front end and have almost nothing to worry about integrating with these multiple different kind of AI providers. AI SDK gives you the best abstraction in that sense. You use it and you're automatically capable of plugging into all the top providers and then some. &gt;&gt; On a similar note, what I think is cool is you have this B Y bring your own keys which basically means you don't have to pay for API LLM costs. So I'm curious, what are the costs and margins for a business like this? You really don't have big server costs and you don't have API cost. So what does it cost to run dayto-day? &gt;&gt; It's almost nothing. I only have to pay for my landing page hosting and almost I can bring it to zero. But because I'm like a Nex.js spoiled person, I host it on Verso and I have some fancy things going on there. So it cost me about $50 a month and I have a cursor subscription about $200 a month. But that is something that I have to only spend because I have to keep working on new features, not to maintain the existing product. Cool. Well, last question that I have for you, a question that we ask all founders who come on to the channel. If you could stand on Prrenit's shoulder when you were just starting out before you had product market fit in this awesome product that's made a bunch of revenue, what would be your advice? &gt;&gt; I've been trying building different products since the last 6 7 years and for the good chunk of last 5 years. I was operating as a skillsman as an entrepreneur. Your goal is to find product market fit as soon as possible. And your goal is to build something that makes people's lives better. But what I was doing was appealing to my peers, which is totally not the mindset that I need to have as an entrepreneur because your whole purpose should be about finding a product market fit, finding something that you're going to put out in the market and they're going to give you money and reward you in return as a thank you for making their lives better. And that should be your only goal. &gt;&gt; That's really good advice. Thanks for sharing that, Prenit. That was awesome. Thanks for coming on to the channel. What you built is awesome. I'm excited to see what you continue to do and continue to build. Thanks for coming on &gt;&gt; and thanks for having me. It's a great pleasure. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you, Pren, for coming on to the channel. Hopefully, you guys got a bunch of value from this video. I find it super inspiring about how Pren left his full-time job, decided to go build stuff, and especially how he didn't give up after the initial version of his app failed. If you're looking to do something similar and ship your own app, then definitely check out Starter Story Build. It's our program where in just a few weeks, we'll help you find an idea, build it with AI, and launch it to the real world with real users. If this sounds interesting to you, just head to the first link in the description to learn more about what Starter Story Build is about. All right, that's it for this episode.

================================================================================

If any viewers is watching this and does a video on YouTube for 45 days, if they don't make at least $5,000, I'll just PayPal you $500. &gt;&gt; This is Vasco. He built an AI app that in just 2 years went from 0 to $70,000 a month. &gt;&gt; Most our users come from YouTube. &gt;&gt; But here's what's crazy about his story. He did it all with YouTube. One video a day, nothing fancy, no crazy tools, and it worked. &gt;&gt; The way in which you get people to buy from you is if they know, like, and trust you. Using a simple strategy, Vasco turned YouTube videos into a million-dollar business. And I brought him onto the channel to break it all down. In this video, we'll dive into his YouTube strategy that generates $70,000 a month. How you can create money-making assets that sell your product while you sleep, and why YouTube beats every other platform for building trust and getting conversions. All right, this one's going to be fun. Let's dive in. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. All right, welcome Vasco to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; Hey, my name is Vasco. I built a software company called Arvo. We scaled it from zero to around 70K in MR fully organic. And I think the most interesting part about this is that we leverage just one platform, which was YouTube. &gt;&gt; Before we get into this YouTube playbook, which I think is amazing. I think people watching this are going to love it. I just want to understand what your product does. What is Arvo? What does it do? Who are the customers? So, Arvo helps marketing agencies, business owners do SEO a bit faster leveraging AI. SEO tends to be a tedious process, takes a lot a lot of time. We try to shorten the time until where you can see results. It starts from around $99 a month. It goes all the way to almost $700 a month. We do of course as a SAS have charge. So, along the way, we have a lot of clients, but at the moment, we have around 600 paying clients. &gt;&gt; That's amazing. This business is doing basically a million dollars a year. How do you find the idea for Arvo? How do you get to this point? It was 2016 or 2015. I was just browsing YouTube and I came across this guy called Alex Becker and I saw a video from him where he was making supposedly 10K a month doing rank and rent SEO. And so I started doing that. Bought my first domain, started doing local SEO with rank and rent. Got a couple of clients then got a bit tired of dealing with clients. So I just took my SEO services and started selling them on Fiverr, Upwork and other marketplaces. But then I noticed that these marketplaces, they were missing a lot of things that I wanted to see in my own marketplace. And so I built my own SEO marketplace called Vetted. We sold it last year and the AI bubble was just coming. When I sold Vetted, I knew that I wanted to still build something in the SEO space, but now applying AI to it. And so we thought an AI writer could be a good idea. So we built it. That's basically the whole story of how Argo came about. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, what I'm really excited and why I really wanted to have you on the channel, Vasco, is what you told me about how you grew this business. I think a lot of people watching might be wondering how you built it, what the product does. I think one of the coolest things about what you did is how you grew this business. So, can you give me a breakdown of what the main growth channel is for your SAS? Most our users come from YouTube. The way in which you get people to buy from you is if they know, like, and trust you, right? And I think the best way to have someone know, like, and trust you is if they see your face and they hear your voice for long periods of time. All in all, I think YouTube has everything you need to have someone like, and trust you, and then buy from. It's not to say that Tik Tok doesn't work, blogging doesn't work, Twitter, LinkedIn doesn't work. But I think as in terms of a ratio to effort to results, I think YouTube is the best one. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's amazing. This business was grown purely with YouTube. But what I really want to get from you, Vasco, is the full playbook. Tell me exactly how you went from zero to a million-dollar business purely with YouTube. &gt;&gt; So this was basically our playbook in three core steps. First one is you have to focus on producing money making assets. I just produce a bunch of long form content in basically three buckets. First bucket again is evergreen. So a video that I know that if I post today, it will still keep on getting views a year, two years from now. And we do have those videos. I'll give you an example. We have a video on the best AI SEO writer. The second bucket is news relevant type videos that get a lot of views in the first two or three days and then die out. These are basically a new Google update comes out. This is good to get a bunch of subs and a bunch of new eyeballs onto your channel which then you can funnel into your products or services. Then the third is just sort of viral like Mr. Beast like videos but applied to software which is quite hard to do. Then we just do that over and over again. The issue with that is that I'm just one so I'm sort of capped as to how many videos I can do. And so I say this to say that this goes into the second part of the strategy which was how can I multiply myself? And so what I did then was I created a bunch of YouTube channels. Vasco SEO tips, Tim SEO guru, SEO news, whatever. I had all these channels we owned. And so then I had to find creators because my goal was to have all channels and post a creator in each one of those channels. The wrong way to go about finding creators is going and finding creators because they're very expensive and they have a big ego. And so what I did was let me find people who I think can become creators. So I went on Upwork and I skimmed through people's profiles who for example had a video. Having a video on your Upwork profile tells me that you're sort of comfortable in front of the camera. So I went and went after those guys. And so all in all, I had all these channels and I paid people per performance and I paid people per uh per video. On top of that, why not expand to other languages? So we found Portuguese creators, we found Spanish ones just like Mr. Vist does with these channels. After you've done step one and two, you want to focus on the third step, which is scaling and expanding with paid ads. Most of your videos graphs will look like this. They go up, get views, and then they stagnate and get no more views. And so what I've noticed was that when we were getting views, we were getting sales. And then when the views stagnated, we stopped getting sales. I didn't felt like recording the same video over and over again just to get those initial views. And I think that's where paid ads came in. So on YouTube, you can run what's called infeed ads. These ads appear in um two places. First one is on on your YouTube homepage. And then when you're watching a video, it shows up on the right hand sidebar. So they look like organic pieces of content. I took the videos who performed well, who got views, got sales, and then stagnated and I paid YouTube for infeed ads. The issue with YouTube and YouTube ads as well is that it's very hard to track. To track YouTube organic, what we've done is three things. First one again is have a dedicated UTM in each video. If maybe 1% of people click the links in the description, you know that they came from that video. Something else we did to increase the tracking accuracy was have a dedicated coupon in each video. I would say something like, "Hey guys, if you want to check out arvogar.com and by the way, if you want a coupon code, just click the little chat bubble at the bottom and ask the guys from support saying, "Hey, Vasco told me I can get a coupon code. I came from this video. Give me a coupon code." And third thing, if you go on to arbor right now, if you sign up, we have like a welcome questioner where if you select you came from YouTube, a bunch of our channels faces pop up. So, you can choose which creator you came from. When I mentioned about scaling with paid ads, you have to be careful because you never know if you're not promoting a video that's not bringing in many sales. Two extra tips on CTAs. before I was doing the call to action at the end of the video and that doesn't make any sense because most people don't watch all the way through. So just the simple fact of moving the CTA towards the beginning and the middle of the video just increased our numbers of of signups by by a lot. Second thing is don't just make generic call to actions like uh yeah just go check out the website. What we've been doing is we create specific call to actions. So we make them sort of interactive not just a generic one and prompting them to do an action inside of the site. That's it. I think your strategy is really smart. You built this awesome tool and then you use YouTube to grow the business. But it still reminds me, you can't make YouTube videos about a product that doesn't exist. If you watching this don't have something built yet, all the content strategy in the world won't help you. And this is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build. It's our flagship program where you will learn how to build and launch your project using AI coding tools in just a couple weeks. You'll get access to our build experts. You'll join thousands of other builders and you'll learn our complete framework for building and shipping apps. Once you have something built, then you can go start creating YouTube videos just like Basco did. So, if you're ready to build, just head to the first link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. All right, Vasco, let's get to the next question. I would love if you could actually show me a real example from your YouTube channels for your business. Can you show me a YouTube video that kind of changed your business? &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. I guess this is the very first one where I realized the power of YouTube which again this was posted I think 2 years ago. It's a video on how to make a Wikipedia page. It's a very bad tutorial but still till this day it gets 1.2 million impressions. I think around 300 views every single day. 65% of traffic comes from YouTube search. How to create a Wikipedia page, how to make a Wikipedia page. 20% of the traffic comes from Google search. Not only does a video rank on YouTube, it also ranks on Google. And I can go on to the LLM type of things because nowadays we see a bunch of our videos being recommended in these LLMs. So if I can give any tips is to yes build out these evergreen videos. Granted though it's very important to know that mix up these evergreen ones with sharing case studies, sharing news, just produce valuable content and know that there's some chance that those videos can become evergreen in the long run. &gt;&gt; Okay, thanks for sharing those real examples. My next question for you for anyone watching this that wants to do this YouTube thing to build a business through YouTube content, what would be your advice on how to get started if you're getting started right now in 2025? &gt;&gt; I think as cliche as it sounds, like with anything, you have to be consistent and do a lot of volume. I think Alexis said this, it's very difficult that you do something a lot of times for a long period of time and you don't see success. So for YouTube, what I advise is, okay, just post a video every single day for 45 days. Most people will watch this and won't do it. The rest of the people will try to do it and will stop after a week. Maybe like one or two people out of all them will actually do it. And those who do it will actually see success. If any viewers watching this and does a video on YouTube for 45 days, if they don't make at least $5,000, I'll just PayPal you $500. By the way, don't think that you need to have these very polished videos, right? all our videos that got this from literally zero to 70k MR just myself in my basement recording just a micro board like a whiteboard going over valuable stuff. Well, on that note, I think that's cool. You know, starting small, just using Loom. What are the tools that you use and would recommend other people to use if they want to be recording every day, creating lots of content on &gt;&gt; You don't need much. You need Loom. Get the premium version so you can record in HD. You need Myro. That's the whiteboard I use. Then you need some sort of way to edit the videos. I use Camtasia. I think you should put more work and more effort into the hardware than the software. Have a good mic, have a good uh camera, and have good lighting. So, a regular running light or mic. I use this Sure SM7B. That's it. Don't over complicate it. I think the hardest part is getting going. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. I mean, that's a nice stack. Last question that we have for everyone who comes on starter story. If you could go back in time, stand on young Vasco's shoulder when you were just getting started out or for anyone who's watching this that wants to do what you did, build a million-dollar SAS, what would be your advice? I think it's very important to know that this is very hard. This is very difficult. The best piece of advice I can give you is that to increase your chances of succeeding, is you have to work very hard. I did 20 to 30 minute videos every single day for almost a year. Who's willing to do that? To be in the 1%, you have to be willing to do what the other 99% of people aren't willing to do. &gt;&gt; There are no shortcuts. I believe that. Thanks for coming on, Vasco. I love the business that you built. Thanks for sharing this whole YouTube thing, sharing those YouTube videos that you've created. I think people are going to love this. If you enjoyed this video and you're watching this, let me know if you want to have Vasco back on and we can go deeper into the YouTube playbook. So, put a comment down there if you want to see that. We can do it. Otherwise, thanks for coming on, Vasco, and we'll see you soon. &gt;&gt; Cheers. &gt;&gt; All right. I want to thank Vasco again for coming on to the channel. I'm a huge fan of YouTube, obviously, and I think his YouTube strategy is genius. So, congrats on the success, Vasco. But I do have to remind you, if you're watching this, that all of this still starts by building something. Without a product, you'll have nothing to promote. And that's why we launched Starter Story Build. We'll help you build and ship your idea faster than ever before. And in just a few weeks, you'll have a full working app ready to share with the world. So, if you're interested, head to the first link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. All right, that's it for this episode. Thank you guys for watching. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: My two apps made $30M
VIDEO ID: w8oUlfgvcTI
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8oUlfgvcTI
================================================================================

I built two companies doing over $30 million in sales by copying already successful businesses. &gt;&gt; Meet Will. After the real estate crash in 2008, he lost everything and had to start from scratch. &gt;&gt; We didn't see it coming and we just totally got crushed. &gt;&gt; Then he came across the opportunity to build a SAS, but he didn't do it in the conventional way. Instead of reinventing the wheel and building something that didn't exist yet, he developed a framework that led him to make millions of dollars. This is kind of the cold email framework that we use for Uplead and I think anyone can kind of use this and apply this to their business today. &gt;&gt; In this video, Will shares his million-dollar research framework, how to successfully copy lucrative businesses, and the one marketing strategy that's made him millions of dollars. &gt;&gt; The playbooks are already out there. Most people just don't study them. &gt;&gt; Whether you're a seasoned builder or just getting started, this episode might blow your mind. All right, let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, welcome Will to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; My name is Will Cannon. I built UpLED to over $30 million in sales, and I built Signature Lead to over 1.6 million users without raising a dime of funding. I did it all without reinventing the wheel. I took business models that already had product market fit and I added my own little twist to them. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. We're going to get all into this framework of how you built these and took these proven markets. But first, I want to understand a little bit more about your background. How do you get here to this place where you have these awesome software businesses? &gt;&gt; So, at 19, me and my girlfriend, who's now my wife, started our first mortgage company. This was during the subprime mortgage boom. So, there was mortgages being handed out left and right. And we were kind of new to the industry. We're like, what's going on? We started making so much money we couldn't even believe it. And we thought we were on top of the world. This was 2005, 2006, 2007. Everything was going great. And then the mortgage crisis hit. We didn't see it coming and we just totally got crushed. So, then it was time to rebuild. We were like, "Hey, what are we going to do next?" When we had our mortgage company, we were sending a lot of cold emails to loan officers and real estate agents to recruit them. And we had a couple people in our office that would ask us like, "Hey, do you have a list of loan officers or list of real estate agents?" So, we were kind of selling lists on the side and we thought, "Hey, this could be a business." So, we started diving into that further. That's what we did for about 10 years from 2007ish to 2017. We kept running into the same problem, data quality. And that was the kind of the aha moment. We're like, "Hey, there has to be a way or a software that can do this for us." So that was the thought behind Uplead and that was our transition from 10 years of building an agency into SAS. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, before we get into these businesses that you built, how you've grown them and the framework for finding these ideas for these proven markets, can you break down how you actually found the ideas for your two big software companies that you run now? &gt;&gt; For Uple agency, so the data quality from the vendors on the market at the time was around 50 to 60% accurate. We'd scrape the internet for data and that data was also maybe 40 50% accurate. every time we build a list, we'd have to verify the emails. We'd have to send the phone number list to a call center we had in the Philippines to verify the phone numbers. And that was the kind of the aha moment. We're like, hey, why isn't there a tool that can just do this for us? Why isn't there a tool where I can go in, I can punch in my ICP, I can say, here's who I want to target. I click download or export and it'll download and verify the emails and verify the phone numbers in real time. We didn't find any software. We decided to build it ourselves for Signature League, which now has over 1.6 million users. This is how we found the idea. This was 2020 and we saw everything was moving away from face to face. So we knew documents weren't being signed face to face anymore. They were being signed over the internet. So we looked this model up and we saw Docu Sign was the biggest player in the game. They were public. They had a ton of revenue. But their product was complicated. It wasn't easy to use. So we thought there has to be a better way. Why don't we build a simple, easy to use version of DocYsine that was so easy to use your grandmother could use it. That's how we knew this business could be successful. There was already proven product market fit. There was a need in the market for customers that wanted a simple version of a tool that was already on the market and we used our SEO and cold email and other skill sets to acquire customers profitably. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you did this for two very successful businesses. You have this framework for finding ideas that are already proven and then just going and building them doing them somewhat differently. Can you walk me through this framework so that someone watching could potentially do the same? Step one is I would look for markets that already have product market fit. I mean, I'm not Steve Jobs. I had 1.5 GPA growing up. So, I thought it was a lot easier to go into a market that already has product market fit. Now that you found a market that you want to compete in, the next step is finding your unique angle, putting a unique twist on it. It can't just be pricing. It can't just be, hey, we're like XYZ, but a little bit more affordable. There has to be some unique twist to it. So, go look at the one and two star reviews and see what people are complaining about. See what they dislike about the best players in the market. That's our twist. Our twist is what people dislike about the biggest companies in the space because those are the easiest customers to go after and acquire. And that's step three, acquiring customers profitably. Now, this is the hardest part, but if you can get this right, you can build any business. This is the hardest part because you have to have a skill set here. Whether it's cold email, whether it's cold calling, whether it's SEO, whether it's ads. So, my skill sets are around cold email, cold calling, SEO, and a few others. I acquired all of these by reading books, by watching YouTube videos. And step four is execution. Most people talk about building a business, but actually building it is a lot harder. You're going to fail. You're going to have to get back up. You're going to have to keep going. And this playbook, it might not work the first time. I failed at probably over 20 different businesses before having two successful businesses. I think that framework is awesome. I love that playbook. Clearly, it's worked for you for two very successful businesses. But for anyone who's watching right now, I think they might be wondering, how can I do this right now? What are the opportunities that can work in 2025? I'm sure you've come across a bunch of painful problems that you love to solve, but you don't have time for. What would you be building right now that the audience can learn from? &gt;&gt; One idea is a super simple CRM. Almost every business needs a CRM. It's a big market. It's fragmented. There's multiple companies doing billions of dollars in revenue. This is an area I would probably look at if I was building something new today. Number two, I would say a payroll software for small businesses. You have a bunch of companies in the space. Again, really fragmented, multiple winners in the space. If you look at Fresh Books and their SEO strategy around templates and tools, I'd probably copy that playbook right there, right? They've built the playbook for you. There's an SEO advantage I would have in that market. Number three, I would say a website analytics tool. Every business needs to analyze their metrics, their funnel, how much traffic they're getting to their website, attribution, ROI. Your market is almost infinite. And if you can tie in some new things right now around AI, around maybe mentions on LLMs within the analytics tool, I think that'd be a cool tool to start today. &gt;&gt; All right, before we keep going here, I do got to call out something I've been seeing with a lot of founders right now. You're moving fast. Maybe you're close to product market fit or you're prepping for your next round, but then enterprise prospects start asking about your security compliance and suddenly everything slows down. The reality is that in 2025, especially with AI, security expectations hit earlier and harder than ever. You can either get ahead of it or let it become the thing that kills your momentum. Vanta, today's sponsor, basically solves that entire headache. Instead of spending months figuring out SOCK 2 compliance, Vanta's automated workflows get you audit ready fast. And here's what I really like about the platform. It's not just a one-time setup. It keeps monitoring and updating as you scale. Fast growing startups like Langchain, Writer, and Cursor trusted Vanta to build their security foundation early, which means they can focus on growth instead of getting stuck in compliance hell. Right now, Vanta is offering $1,000 off for Starter Story viewers. So, check out vanta.com/starter or click the first link in the description. Over 12,000 companies are already using Vanta to scale smarter. Huge thank you to Vanta for partnering with us at Startertory. Let's dive back into the interview. I want to hear a little bit more about your businesses that you built. We haven't really talked about them yet, but can you share the two businesses that you built in software that are crushing it right now? What do they do? How do they work? And how are they doing? Uple is a B2B data provider with real-time verified emails, mobile numbers, and buyer intent signals. Uple has over $4,000 customers currently. It's done over $30 million in sales, and it gets over 100,000 visits to its website every month. And the other business I have is Signaturely. It's an e signature company. It's an easy and simple to use alternative to docuine. So, Signaturely has over 1.6 million users. It's done over 1.5 million in sales and it gets over 800,000 visits per month. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. And those are amazing businesses beyond the framework for finding these ideas, which we talked a bunch about. I'd also be curious to hear about how you actually grew and scaled these businesses. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? &gt;&gt; Uple got its first 1 million in annual recurring revenue strictly from cold email. So, this is kind of the cold So, here's the cold email that got us our first million dollars in ARR. I'll break it down. The subject line is, "Hi, first name." So, hi James. The first line is, "I was checking out your LinkedIn profile and thought this could be of value to you. We built a tool called Uple, which is like Zoom Info but with real-time email verification, and we're really affordable. Are you open to trying it out at no cost?" So, the subject line is, "Hi, James. It looks like it came from a real person." The intro is neutral and direct. I saw your profile. There's no hype there. The value prop is clear and familiar. We framed it against the biggest company in the market, Zoom Info, but better. We told what our twist is. And then the ask, are you open to trying it out at no cost? We try to make the ask so easy it's hard to say no. You don't need long emails. You need short ones that feel human. And I think any business can take this. They can tweak those lines and they can send out the same cold email that we did. So from Signature, we got from 0 to 1.6 million users mainly from SEO. We use the strategy around tools and templates and ranking for them high in search in order to get our first customers. We built a free online signature tool where you can type or handdraw your signature and you can download it and then we push them to go use that to sign documents. So that was a one of the tools we use as part of our funnel. And then we also wrote templates. So we wrote marketing agreements and construction agreements and landlord agreements and we ranked a bunch of templates. Templates and contracts and that was how we got our first thousand plus customers. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, thanks for sharing that. I mean, SEO, I love SEO. Big reason Starter Story grew as well. The last question that I have for you that we ask everyone who comes on Starter Story, you built these amazing businesses. What would you say to a younger Will, if you could stand on his shoulder and give him advice from when you were just starting out, you had the failed mortgage company. What would be your advice to someone just starting out like you? &gt;&gt; Have these big, hairy, audacious goals, these crazy goals, these moonshots, right? I remember when I was first starting out, I thought if I could just make $5,000 a month, that would be enough. and then you hit that and then you go to the next level. So have big goals. Another one is things are going to come up every day that get in your way. Don't sweat the small stuff. Think about the big picture. Another piece of advice is you have to just keep going. You're going to fail. You're going to have to get back up, right? I failed at probably 15, 20 different businesses before I built two that were super successful. Well, thanks for coming on the channel. I appreciate you sharing your story and these amazing businesses that you built. Hope to have you on again sometime and see your businesses grow even more. So, thanks for coming on. &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Pat. Thanks again to Will for coming on to the channel and sharing his story. I love his approach to building businesses where it's not about creating a whole new category, but instead just adding a small twist on what's already out there.

TITLE: How We Built a $10K/mo SaaS
VIDEO ID: 3eY71OS4MFw
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eY71OS4MFw
================================================================================

My name is Joseph and I'm Teimmo. Together, we built Cedari to 10K MR. &gt;&gt; These two guys met each other in a co-working space and decided to partner up. But they were burned out by what I like to call builder's disease. &gt;&gt; I quit my job and spent a whole year building without any traction. &gt;&gt; So, they came up with a better strategy. Get paid before building anything. We made $500 before we wrote a single line of code. So, I brought them both onto the channel to break down the exact validation strategy to not waste years on a dead product, the deposit framework, which is how to ask for refundable deposit before you build anything, and the exact fake landing page and demo they used that changed their business. This video may rewire your brain on how to validate and build a startup today. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, welcome Joseph and Teemo to the channel. Tell me about who you guys are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; My name is Joseph. I quit freelancing as a software engineer to start indie hacking. &gt;&gt; And my name is Timu. I live in Bangkok, and together we started Setai, which now makes 10K Mr. All right. Well, before we get into what you guys built, how you built it in this awesome story. Can you just tell me about what Setter AI is? What kind of app is this? &gt;&gt; Setter. AI is an AI appointment setter that follows up and qualifies with your leads instantly. It's a high ticket agentic B2B SAS. We have a pretty classical subscription model which starts at around $50 per month. Some pay over 500 bucks and our biggest customer pay up to $5,000 per month. We mainly target the solar industry, coaches, financial services anywhere to replace sales reps. Okay. So, one thing that I love about your guys' story is that you technically validated this idea before you built anything. I think that's amazing. I think there's a lot we can learn from that. So, can you share with me how you did that? How did you know you had a business before you even wrote a single line of code? So, as soon as I had the idea, I set up a landing page. I did it months prior to even starting the business. The landing page was set up under a warm domain. So, a domain from a different business that I've already owned and that has been indexed with Google already. I created a completely fake demo for this product because the product wasn't there yet, and put it on this landing page. I think it's the most loweffort way to validate the idea because I wanted to find out if people would actually pay for this. I knew building this AI caller, which was the initial idea, would require a lot of effort. And for me, I just wanted to find out what would business owners pay for this. So, would it be worth building? &gt;&gt; It'd be awesome if you could actually show me this landing page right here, cuz I think this is super cool to just basically not actually write anything, write any code, and just purely validate the idea with everything being faked. something you could put together pretty quickly. Could you actually show me that landing page? &gt;&gt; So, this was the initial landing page. Super super simple. One H1 keyword and then the demo on the right side and then a book demo button. There was really nothing else on this page and it ranked on Google with this. So, this was version one. I wanted to automate cold calls. So, my idea was okay, let me put cold call automation as the H1 keyword. So, I went to hrefs, found this keyword, saw it has search volume but no difficulty. So, I put this as the H1 here. This is the main keyword that Google will index. And then I just put some like chip generated text here to like have some a little bit more text on the page. Here's the demo is like a fake AI caller demo that I generated with 11 Labs. So, yeah, the call to action is literally just a calendar link of mine. If prospects see the video demo, then they would usually go and book a demo call after that. And then I would chat with them about, okay, what do you actually need in your business? So, one of the key elements here is getting this landing page indexed immediately. And ideally, you have already a domain that is online of a previous startup of yours, your personal page, whatever, a domain that is not brand new. Once a page is created, you go to Google Search Console and request the indexing of that page. That way, you make sure this page is literally indexed within 24 hours and people can find it on Google. Okay. I mean, that's amazing. My question that I do still have is like how did you know it was validated? Was there a specific number of traffic or booked calls? Like what did that look like for you versus previous apps that weren't validated? I think the only way to validate is when buyers swipe their credit card. When we got our first uh Stripe payment of $500 before we even had a product, I knew this is validated. And that happened in February 2024. And I was surprised there was even a company with a billion dollar revenue booking a call with me. For me, that was a clear sign. That is insane. Nobody else is doing this. This is an underserved opportunity. We should do this right now because if I can rank with a fake landing page for this keyword and this big company books a call with me, I should do this opportunity. Okay, this is amazing. I love how you did this. What I want to get from you is the validation playbook. If you were starting over from scratch with a new product right now, what would be your playbook to validate before you build? Step one, have a job. I think the best pain point to find B2B ideas is not look around on Reddit or something because business owners, frankly, they don't really check Reddit. The best way to be in a business is having a job at some point of your life. So, having a job, I think, is actually an absolute advantage compared to indie hackers or builders who never had a job because they don't really know all the processes that happen in a business. Step number two, set up a landing page. Do some basic SEO research. Go to hrefs or go to any free SEO tool. Search for keywords that buyers would search for. Step three, set up a Calendarly link. They see your face on a call. They know you're a real human. They trust you. And then you try to close them on a call and try to swipe their credit card while you're on a sales call. Step four, the deposit framework. Don't say, "Please pay for my non-existing solution." Or even make them pay monthly for something that is not there. The better way is deliver as much value as you can and give them a 100% refundable deposit offer. Say, for example, $500 you take down. It's a onetime payment that you take and the buyer gets full access to your product. Once it launches, you can also put some urgency in there. For example, this secures you a spot in the first launch of the product. Also, one big point, go high ticket. If you go this route and do a do a call with the buyer, don't charge them $20 or something. Charge them something serious so you know they are in. Nothing validates your idea more than someone swiping their credit card. Step five, give it some time to incubate. So, if you go the SEO route, it's going to take a little bit of time, but you will get serious buyers because they search for a solution. So, give it a little bit of time to incubate. I love how Teemo shared the exact framework for how to validate before building. Collecting cash before writing code is definitely the way to go, especially if you want to ship a successful app as a solo founder. But when it comes to actually building the app, you might lose all momentum. So many founders waste weeks, if not months, on the UI stage, tweaking spacing and buttons and second-guessing every layout at 1:00 a.m. in the morning. And that's where Mobin comes in. And yes, they're today's sponsor, but honestly, they're one of my favorite tools for getting out of the design spiral fast and building something beautiful. Mobin is basically a giant organized vault of realworld product designs. actual apps, actual screens broken down by feature, flow, style, all of it. So instead of guessing on how to design a pricing page or an onboarding flow, you can just see how the best apps in the world do it and build from that 10 times faster. Mobin has personally saved me hours and honestly, it makes designing kind of fun again. Just click the first link in the description if you want to check out Mobin right now. They're offering starter story members 20% off their annual pro plan. Huge thank you to Mobin for supporting this video. Let's get back into it. I'm also curious to hear from you guys. You're busy building your business, but I'm sure you're seeing lots of other cool ideas you could be building right now. What are some good ideas that you think are worth starting in 2025? AI is super hot right now, and it opens up so many new opportunities and possibilities that haven't been there before, but also opportunities to do something in completely new and different ways. There are also so many non-technical people who want to build with AI. So facilitating that for them, gluing softwares together or automating workflows is the play. I think one idea from me, Lovable for mobile apps. So Lovable is absolutely great for building simple web apps, landing pages, but I realized most internet users are on mobile and mobile apps are not as easy to build as web apps. So if someone can figure out a builder like lovable but for let's say swift apps I think that is one of the biggest opportunities you can go after and I think that could even be bigger than lovable itself which has like a billion dollar valuation. Okay so the next thing I I want to switch to is growth. Obviously this validation strategy is a great way to get those first customers get that initial demand but then you need to sort of scale it and figure out a growth strategy. So what did you guys do for setter? &gt;&gt; We basically went purely inbound. We figured to just double down on what works already and what validated the idea because that's where our first customers came from and that was SEO and content. Once we launched our actual website for Seti within a week, we ranked on page one on Google and now ranked number one worldwide for this keyword. The SEO growth came through main strategies. First, building free tools that people can search up such as free sales script generator. Second, log articles that compare to other big tools in the space. for instance, something like HubSpot alternatives. The third one, and that's a very underrated one, is definitely YouTube long format. Most of the customers we closed came through watching at least one YouTube video before jumping on a call. YouTube and watching long format content by nature has this high intent from the watcher, but then also creates insane trust into your business already. Also, it's the second biggest search engine after Google. Think about that. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, let's dive into some of the numbers behind the business. I'm curious, how's this business doing financially? What are some of the revenue profit that you could share? &gt;&gt; Pretty much exactly 10K last month. Uh we had higher months before, but August is always a slow month in B2B. We had around 2,000 total signups of uh businesses. Um we have focused more on the higher paying businesses because we saw lower churn with these. So our paying customer number is only 38 but therefore these are like high value businesses. We also applied to YC five times. Uh we got one interview and we have not been selected yet. Also, our channel on YouTube has 600 subs and uh we also got some acquisition offers recently that we are weighing. Thanks for sharing that. On that same note, I'd also love to hear about your tech stack. How does this business run? What's the stack you're using and what tools you use to run the business? &gt;&gt; We use hrefs for SEO, use answer the public for YouTube video ideas, I use Zapier to automate tedious task. I use Beehive for email automation and newsletters. I use Calendarly to schedule appointments. We use Webflow to host the landing page and the CMS and your businessnumber.com to buy phone numbers. On the tech side, we have a pretty scalable and straightforward mainly serverless stack. It's built on top of TypeScript and SWELGit. The database is a Postgress host both on render and superbase which are combined at around $150 per month. We use Puppeteer for browser automation and fall back to OpenAI for all of the AI stuff. We also use things like the brand fetch API. We use Plausible for analytics. It's just $29 a month and just so much easier to use and better than Google Analytics in our opinion. For development, we're hosted on Netlifi. We use Cursor for AI assisted coding. &gt;&gt; Cool. And on that same note, what does it cost to run a B2B SAS like this? What are the margins like? &gt;&gt; The margins are great. Without ads, it's 90 plus%. Tried ads, hired some freelancers for some work, so it's more down to like 80%. The highest cost per month is OpenAI API around $250 a month or hiring some Upwork freelancers here and there which can add up to $500 a month. Well, thanks for sharing that. The last question that I have for both of you is advice for anyone watching this channel. If you were to start over today or if you could stand on the shoulders of Teemo and Joseph when they were just starting out trying to figure out how to do this thing online, what would be your advice? &gt;&gt; Charge early on. Don't be afraid to charge because charging creates urgency and commitment not only from you but also your customer. Go high ticket. It makes your life easier. Sell to rich people, they pay better is what Homozi likes to say. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. Thank you guys for coming on the channel. I love the business you built. You did it in just over a year, which is amazing. I'm sure it's going to keep growing. And uh you guys are awesome. Thanks for coming on. &gt;&gt; Thanks for having us, Pat. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you to Joseph and Teemo for coming on to the channel. I think what they did is a great example of how to build lean, successful apps that might change your life. If you're looking to get started and do something similar yourself, well, I have something for you. Starter Story Build is our program where you will go from an idea to a working app in less than 2 weeks. Frankly, this wasn't possible before AI. But now, with the right structure, you can do it even if you have a full-time job or no coding experience. Just click the link in the description to start a story build if you want to learn more. Otherwise, I hope you guys enjoyed this episode. I'll see you in the next one. Peace. [Music]

TITLE: My app makes $41K/month
VIDEO ID: a1EXyJlSx9g
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1EXyJlSx9g
================================================================================

I'm going to be honest. I get a lot of DMs from people who want to come onto the channel. I'm sure they're cool, but 90% of those DMs don't go anywhere. But what about the other 10%. Well, that's who you're going to meet today. This is Joe. He's never shared his story before, and he DM'd me and said, "I'm a solo founder and I make over $40,000 a month with this app." This sounded cool, so I had to know more. And what he shared blew me away. So, I decided to bring Joe onto the channel to share how he took a simple problem and turned it into a $40,000 per month business. In this video, we'll dive into how he found this idea in the most unexpected of places, why he quit his career in engineering to build it and become a solopreneur, and how simple apps like his can compete with billion-dollar competitors. I'm really excited for this one, so let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. All right, welcome to the channel, Joe. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; Yeah, hi, my name is Joe. I built an app called Weightley. I originally launched it as a side project, and now it makes over $40,000 a month. &gt;&gt; All right, cool. Before we get into Weightley and what you built, I'd love to learn a little bit more about your background and how you get here. &gt;&gt; So, I was always into computers growing up and so I went to college and got a degree in computer science. Came out of college and started a career as a software engineer. But in 2008, I landed a job with Shutterfly, the online photo gif company. And it was the first time in my career that I thought I was building something fun and cool. I continued my career by moving into management at Shutterfly. And I immediately missed the coding aspects or building aspects of my job. I was building teams rather than apps. So I started looking for a side project where I could learn how to build iOS apps. It's something I hadn't done in the past and I was interested in learning. &gt;&gt; That's cool. I'd love to learn more about how you came across the idea for Weightley. How did that happen? &gt;&gt; In 2017, I went to brunch and it was a busy Saturday morning and we got put on the wait list. I got a text that I was on the wait list and there was a link that said, "Click here to see your weight time." Tapped the link on my phone and it immediately wanted me to download Yelp and sign up for an account just to see my weight time. By the time that I signed up for an account and everything, I got a text that my table was ready. So I thought to myself, this link should just take me to a page where I could see my weight time. I shouldn't have to sign up for an account. That's when my wife suggested maybe you could build a weight list app. So 6 months in, I was really fired up. Had a working prototype. I could add people to the list. I couldn't text anyone yet. And about a year and a half in, I really dug deep and said, "All right, I'm going to get to the point where I could launch this in the app store." Finally launched it. And within the first week, I had 10 downloads. And then about two years in is when I finally launched inapp purchases in the app store and really started growing the business. &gt;&gt; Okay, quick pause. Let's talk about something that is secretly killing so many new founders. Not getting your business foundations right. I'm talking missed deadlines, messy vendors, tax confusion, compliance drama. This kind of stuff builds up fast and then suddenly you're buried in admin work instead of building stuff and generating revenue. That's why I'm a huge fan of today's sponsor, Doula. Doula will help you set up your LLC, handle your bookkeeping, stay tax compliant, all in one place. It's basically like having an ops team without all the overhead. And what I really like is they don't just hand you a checklist and leave you to figure it out. They actually stick with you and make sure you're set up for success from day one. Thousands of entrepreneurs in over 175 countries use Doula because it actually works. Stop burning time on admin work. Let Doula handle the boring stuff so you can focus on what actually matters, building your business. If you're starting something right now, then head to the first link in the description and use the code starter story for 10% off. Thanks to Doula for supporting the channel. Now, let's get back into it. Now, this business is doing over 40,000 MR. Can you give me a little bit of a timeline of that growth? How do you get there? &gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely. So in year 1 made no money when it launched like I said there was free version. Year two we made 14,500. Year three is when it really took off made about 116,000. Year 4 was 186,000. Year 5 was 307,000. Year 6 was 354,000. Year 7 was $445,000. And this year we're on pace to make over half a million. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, congrats. your business is doing half a million dollars subscription business. Can you break down some of the growth strategies or marketing strategies that got you there? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so one of the main drivers for us is Apple search ads. We run ads on certain keywords that helps drive people downloading the app. Cost to acquire a customer for us is about $130. The lifetime value of those customers is between $750 and $1,000. So, as much money as we can put into those ads, there's definitely ROI there. Next, we try to nurture those customers with emails. We have some emails with tips to get started, some quick start videos. Uh we offer onboarding through Zoom, uh staff training of employees if necessary, and near the end of those trials, we offer promotions to really try to get them to make that first purchase. I'd love to see the app that you built. What is Weightley? How does it work? Can you show it to the people watching here so we can really understand what you built? &gt;&gt; Absolutely. So, Weightley is a wait list and reservations platform for any business that has waiting customers. You go to a restaurant, it's busy, they don't have a table for you quite yet, so they might add you to the weight list. So, you can just put in a name, a party size, what your estimated weight might be, guest phone number, and then any seating preference you may have like inside, outside, and now suddenly you're on the wait list. Within a few seconds, that customer would get a text message letting them know they're on the wait list. There's a link in that text message that they tap. They'll see their wait time. They don't need to download any app. And then when I'm ready to serve that customer, I can just tap notify and they'll receive a second text message just letting them know that the table's ready. Once I've served that person, I just simply check them off the list. All right, cool. My next question is, why would any restaurant use your software over these bigger companies? How do you compete with billion-dollar companies? &gt;&gt; We compete a couple different ways. One is on price. Whe has a flat fee of $100 a month to unlock all the features where Yelp and Open Table, their flat fees are hundreds of dollars a month. And then for any reservations that are booked through their platform, they charge cover fees. The second thing we compete on is simplicity. One of the benefits of only doing weight list and reservations is it can work for other industries. During COVID, we had a bunch of retail chains who had limited capacity in their stores want a wait list so people could wait outside for their turn. And we put Weightley in over 700 locations around the United States and that 10xed our business that year. And the third thing we compete on is customer service. So anytime that someone calls our support line, someone answers immediately. They're always surprised that someone picked up right away to answer their call. All right, cool. For anyone watching this right now, what would be your framework for looking for an idea today? &gt;&gt; You don't need a new idea. There's plenty of ideas out there, problems that have been solved that you could improve upon. And while you're improving upon that, you might find a niche within that industry. Whe is a perfect example of that. I competed with the giants like Open Table and found a little niche within that industry where I can serve the small restaurants that are underserved. Step two would be I would use AI to build my minimum viable product quickly. Nowadays, you could do that in just a couple weeks. Get something out there quickly. Number three would be get feedback on that idea from your early customers. And number four is just expect the unexpected. Get ready to adapt because things never go as you expect and you're going to have to adapt. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's all great advice. I'd also love to get some specific ideas you think might be worth building. Yeah. So, one idea I'm actually playing around with is I play in a pickle ball league. The spreadsheets that we keep to keep track of everyone's points is getting out of hand. So, I'm looking at building a pickle ball league management app, maybe with a social aspect for people to find games in their area to play in. A second idea would be an AI support chatbot that can be used and trained on specific products or websites. And one big idea I have, and this is another competing with giants moment, is social media. I feel like social media today is run by corporations and influencers and everyone's doom scrolling and I think people are really itching to connect with friends and family again like they did in the early days of social media. So I think there's definitely room for someone to come in and mix up the social media space. &gt;&gt; Okay, I like those ideas. Switching topics a little bit. I'd love to hear some of the numbers behind Weightley. Can you break down some of the metrics and numbers behind this business? We've had over 15,000 businesses try weightly. We currently have 700 paying customers around the US and Canada. Since weightly launched, we've had over 59 million parties weight listed on weight lists. &gt;&gt; Wow, that's crazy. Can you break down the tech stack? How did you build this app? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so weightely is built on top of Google Firebase. We use it for hosting and authentication and database. We use Node.js as language for our back-end services. The iOS app is written in Swift. And finally, the web version of Weightley is written in ReactJS. &gt;&gt; And on that same note, I'd love to hear some of the costs and margins of this business. I understand you're a solo developer. What do the costs look like for a business like this? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so Firebase costs us about $700 a month. All the business text messages we send is about $2,500 a month. We use Revenue Cat for subscriptions in the iOS app. That's 1% of revenue. Apple Search Ads, currently we're spending about $500 a month. This fluctuates different times of the year. Stripe is 3% of revenue for any payments that we take from our website. Uh we use Survey Monkey to capture feedback from our customers. That's $35 a month. We use Hive for project management. That's about $25 a month. Freshes for customer support tickets. This is about $40 a month. And now we're spending about $200 a month on Claude Code. We use Chat GPT for email content and that's about $20 a month. And we use Calendarly for booking demos on our website and that's about $12 a month. &gt;&gt; Nice. Final question that we asked to everyone who comes on the channel. If you could go back and stand on Joe's shoulders when you had gone into that management role, you were looking for the right side project to build, what would be your advice for young Joe? &gt;&gt; Keep going. Definitely. When that self-doubt creeps in, when you're competing with giants, you're not sure if you can actually go forward, just keep going. Acknowledge that your doubts have no basis in reality because you cannot predict the future. Launch your product and see what the future holds. &gt;&gt; Well, that's great advice. Thank you for coming on the channel, Joe. I love the business you built. I love your story and hope to see you on again soon. &gt;&gt; Thanks, Pat. Thanks again to Joe for coming on to the channel. I love his story because it's proof that you can solve a simple problem and build a really nice, successful business. I'm willing to bet that in the last week, you may have come across some similar problems as well. So why not try to build something that solves them? Well, that's what we created with Startory Build, our program where we will guide you on how to use AI to go from an idea to an app in just a few days. Imagine you build something that solves a real problem and you ship it to the world for real users to use and get value from. That is a really cool feeling. So if you're interested, just head to the link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. Thanks again for watching. I'll see you guys in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: How I Made $65K in 3 Days
VIDEO ID: BNr1JOQdSN0
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNr1JOQdSN0
================================================================================

I launched my app and made $65,000 in 3 days with zero audience. &gt;&gt; Meet Devon, an indie hacker from India who failed at multiple startups before stumbling across a strategy that would change everything. &gt;&gt; Lifetime deals are a cheat code because it gives you and most importantly, &gt;&gt; now Devon runs a successful app making around $20,000 a month. So, I invited him onto the channel to break down this strategy that changed his business. &gt;&gt; I was always a struggling entrepreneur. I didn't know how to build distribution. &gt;&gt; In this episode, Devin will break down his app and how he grew it to $200,000 a year. We'll go over his $65,000 launch strategy, and why you should consider doing the same, and the lifetime deal strategy, the pros and cons, and why it actually might be genius. This one might be controversial, but I'm excited to get into it. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. All right, Devin, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; Hi, Pat. My name is Din and I'm one of the co-founders of Supergrow. Supergrow is a SAS that helps professionals build their personal brand on LinkedIn and now it makes $230,000 a year. I'm excited to come out to the channel and talk about lifetime deals. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I'm excited to talk about lifetime deals, but first I want to get some stats on this. Give me just a high level of how much cash your lifetime deal generated and then how the business is doing today. &gt;&gt; Yeah, like uh when we launched lifetime deal, we generated $65,000 in 3 days. Right now we are not focusing on LTD but we have a subscription business. So right now currently we are making more than $19,000 per month. We currently have more than 800 plus recurring customers. Usually we get around more than 15,000 visits every month on our landing page. &gt;&gt; Before we get into the lifetime deals and the cash the crazy cash infusion you had in this business. Let's just talk about how you came up with the idea for this. How did you come up with the idea for Supergrow? Yeah, like after my last product shutdown, I started looking for some markets because I already knew like I don't want to create a new category. So, uh I found lot of LinkedIn tools doing really great. I actually tried their tool out and I actually was not happy with the content creation piece. Around the same time, GP3 was launched and uh it actually changed the whole content creation game because it was really good at mimicking the writing style of the user. So I created an sort of an MVP over the weekend and I really loved it because uh I was able to convert my own raw thoughts into LinkedIn worthy post and it was really amazing. So I thought there is something which I can do here and that's how like I've ended up with supergrow. &gt;&gt; Okay. So that's sort of interesting. You looked at the existing competitors in the market you realized that their solutions just weren't all that great. That gave you the confidence to build something. Could you dive deeper into that sort of validation strategy? So uh one thing which I always tell indie hackers is don't try to create new market just work on the validated market. So what I suggest lot of people is go for products or go for markets which are actually generating revenue. Once you have identified the validated market your next step should be to figure out what are your competitors. So deeply understand your competitors use their product day in day out and try to understand what are their core flows. Try to come up with a new way to solve the core flows. So once you are able to come up with a sort of a 1% increment in the quality of the product like you can just go ahead and just build an MVP after that. What I did was I did exactly this. So I actually studied my three competitors who were like the biggest competitors in my market back then. One was Tableau. The second one was content in the third one was authored up. Tableau was the like the biggest in the market. They had like numerous features but the core feature which is basically content creation piece was not that great. And after studying all these products, I realized the demand in the market is so much that even products like these are able to like earn revenue. So I realized like I can serve this demand really well. &gt;&gt; All right, cool. Well, we find the idea, we start building it. Now let's talk about lifetime deals. So essentially the lifetime deal generated $65,000 in about 3 days. Can you tell us how you get there? When I started Supergrow, I had 600 followers on Twitter and maybe like 500 followers on LinkedIn. I was always a struggling entrepreneur. I didn't know how to build distribution. So, uh I only had like two three customers back then and I actually didn't know how to get more customers. One of the co-founder of Rocket Up, Charlie actually saw our journey on LinkedIn and he actually reached out to us. We would love to help you launch uh Supergrow on Rocket Up. So that was really exciting because we were not expecting that and initially to be honest with you I was really skeptical but uh like after talking to Charlie I kind of get it like why people do LTDs. &gt;&gt; Okay. I want to hear some of the kind of the dirty details of the lifetime deal. How did you price it? How did that work? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So actually Rocketub helped us with the pricing. So we launched three different tiers. So the basic pricing tier was $79 which basically translate to our basic plan right now. The second plan was $199 which is a pro plan. The third plan was the agency plan which was $299. So whoever bought the product back then they were getting like 4 to 5 years of value just by paying like $299 $199. &gt;&gt; Okay. So the pricing is interesting. I'm also curious about the platform's role. What did they actually do for you? And also more importantly, what percentage cut did they take of the lifetime sales? &gt;&gt; They actually do everything for you apart from the product. What rocketub did was they marketed our product across lot of different platforms. They did multiple things. They have a list of hundreds of thousands of customers who are ready to buy LTDs. The first thing they did was they send email to all all of their customers and they talked about a super grow with them. Uh the second thing which they did was they created ads for Instagram and Facebook. And the third thing which they did was they basically created all the marketing assets like they created screenshots, videos which we still use some of these even today. So they created all these assets and they launched super for us. Essentially our role was build the product and the second was support which is really crucial for entity because you are going to get lot of queries and stuff. So those were the only two things which we did. Everything regarding marketing was actually done by rocketub. So for this rocketup took like 40% of the cut which translates to around $40,000 for us. Obviously, it's a big cut. 40% is a huge cut. But if you think about it, at that moment, we did not have like we had only like one or two customers. We had almost close to $0, but just by launching our product through them, we were able to generate $40,000. Okay. Wow, that's a big cut, 40%, I imagine a lot of people watching this are like, why would you give up that much of a product that you built? I'd love to hear from you about the pros and the cons of lifetime deals. I talked to a lot of founders. Some of them love it, clearly like you. some of them regret it. So let's talk about it. What are the pros and cons? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So one of the see the biggest benefit of LTD is cash infusion validation and early feedback. Initially when you are starting a company, when you're starting a product, you essentially have zero customers. You are looking for people who can use your product and give you feedback. Through LTD, we got both the things. There are like couple of downsides. So the biggest downside is high platform cut because in our case, Rocket Up took 40% of the revenue. And the second downside is we got a lot of angry customers reaching out to you for feature requests, for missing features, for bugs and stuff. And also when you launch LKD, you attract a lot of cheap customers also. So, so that sort of gives perception your product is not that great. So these are the three downsides of uh LTD. &gt;&gt; Okay. Interesting. So yeah, I mean definitely pros, definitely cons. What I think is cool about it is the early feedback. So I guess my next question would be for you is did that lifetime deal those hundreds of customers join did that actually help improve your product? &gt;&gt; Yeah definitely we had actually around more than 250 plus LTD customers. So there is a churn in LTD customers also the only like 10% of these customers are really going to use your product after a certain period around 20 to 25 customers they genuinely use the product every week. They used to give us very brutal feedback like because we were really new in the market they were not really polite. So they used to message us on intercom. Some of the customers were able to get our members also from internet. Some of these customers were really good. They actually helped us shape the road map. So they gave us a lot of good insights into content creation on LinkedIn that actually helped us improve the product massively. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, before we get back to Devon's story, let's talk about what he actually did. He didn't build a crazy new idea. He noticed a simple problem. He saw there was actually competition for it, but he still built something that was just a little bit better. And that one idea turned into a now $200,000 per year business. This is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build. It's a program where we help you find your simple idea, build it using AI coding tools, and actually help you ship it to the world. The best part, you don't need years of coding experience. AI does the heavy lifting. So, if you're ready to turn a simple idea into your next project, just head to the first link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. All right, let's get back to the episode. Okay, so let's go over some of the objections that people do have to LTDs. I posted about lifetime deals on X and someone wrote something along the lines of lifetime deals are just founder coping for a bad product. What do you think about that? &gt;&gt; So what I feel is actually LTD exposes bad products really faster because these LTD customers are going to give very brutal feedback to you. So I don't feel like LTD is just a core for a bad product. &gt;&gt; Cool. I I mean I like that. What if instead you just offer your product for free to get feedback? &gt;&gt; What happens? What I've realized is free users don't actually validate the your product. They will just consume it and if something doesn't work, they will just ghost you. But already customers because they have put real money into your business, they are going to give you good feedback. So they are going to basically tell you what exactly is broken in your product. The other alternative that I've heard about is maybe you offer a really cheap yearly plan or maybe even you offer just one year of access to the product. What do you think about that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think like you will be able to attract that much attention through cheap annual plans and also at the same time I don't think you will be able to generate that much of a revenue with cheap plans because see like we had generated $65 in 3 days. I don't think like if we have launched like annual plan we would have generated that much amount of money. Now also like if you think about it, Ltd buyers actually feel special. They got a deal nobody else will get in future. So this sort of creates an urgency in FOMO that annual plans won't be able to match. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. The last objection that I hear is that doing an LTD will kill your future long-term growth because you can't make any money from those people that you sold the LTDs too. What do you think about that? &gt;&gt; That's actually not true. What I've realized is you uh in future you can actually upsell them. So that is another thing which you can do and and also at the same time what I feel is you don't want to launch LTD for a long period of time. So for example we launched LD only for 3 days. So the very good way to ensure you're not overselling LTS is just limit the time frame and also limit the number of users you are going to like support. So we limited that to 300 users. So because we launched only for 3 days and and also like we we did lot of upselling to these LTD customers that actually helped us build our subscription business as well. &gt;&gt; Okay. Interesting. I mean on that note I would love to hear about the transition. I mean you went from LTD strategy uh that sort of kickstarted the business but then you transitioned it to uh subscription. I think a lot of people watching would like to hear what worked for you in terms of that transition and what advice would you have for other people trying to do the same? One of the biggest thing that we did just after launching LTD was we actually make sure our customers were happy. So we were really obsessed with our LTD customers. We used to spend like one or two hours every day on intercom answering their question helping them through content creation. Like we sometimes used to help them manually and then used to convert those workflows into features inside supergrow. So we did this for a couple of months. It actually helped us a lot in improving the product. We also added these tools called clarity and mix panel to really understand what these customers were doing. So we used to basically see which feature set they are using, which feature set they are not using. We did this like for a couple of months but then we created this plan of launching our product on product. So what we did we actually launched it on product and we were able to become like product of the week in product and and actually gave us 50 customers also. So one of the key things these LTD customers actually helped us uh make our product and launch better because they actually evangelized our product everywhere. I was not the only person talking about my product that day. We had like 10 to 15 really happy LTD customers who actually talked about us on LinkedIn on Twitter on product hunt and they also shared about our product on these platforms like WhatsApp groups and stuff. Launching on LTD is not just for cash. It's for these purposes also like we were able to create 10 15 ambassadors for our product that actually helped us make our product product of the week. &gt;&gt; I think that's super cool and I didn't think about it that way is that lifetime helps build community around your product which led to a really big product hunt launch. That's super cool. Let's switch topics real quick. Uh I want to hear about tech stack. What kind of tools languages stack do you use to build this business? &gt;&gt; For app I use rails, react and tailwind. I use Postgress for DB. Superbase for O and uh like assets. Railway for hosting, framer for landing page, superguri for LinkedIn content creation, intercom for live chat, mix panel for product analytics, Stripe for payments, and Microsoft clarity for session recordings. &gt;&gt; Could you also, if you're comfortable sharing, break down some of the costs and margins to run this business? &gt;&gt; So there are three broad categories of expense. One is basically marketing and affiliates. Currently, we are spending around $3,000 there. Apart from that, we do have some freelancers who help us with design and product. We're currently spending more than $1,000 there. So, if I add everything, we are currently at 60 to 70% profit margin. &gt;&gt; Thanks for sharing that. And uh the last question that I have for you is a question we ask all founders who come on Starter Story. If you could stand on Young Devon's shoulders before you had this amazing business that you built, before the lifetime deal, what would be your advice to young Devon and for anyone watching right now? I think my one piece of advice would be don't work in an unvalidated market and don't think of creating a very unique solution in a unique market. I think it's okay to build a better version of an existing product that's getting traction. As an ND hacker, it's very hard for us to educate users on the problem. So I would suggest focus on validated markets. Don't hesitate. Don't think you need to create a really unique product. You can just build a better version of existing products. &gt;&gt; All right, Devin, thanks for coming on the channel. I think what you did is awesome. I think lifetime deals are super cool. And hopefully anybody watching this got to learn something really cool today. Let us know in the comments what you think about lifetime deals. You think they're good? You think they're cope for bad founders? I'd love to hear. But thanks for coming on the channel, Devin. &gt;&gt; Thanks, Brad. Thanks for having me. &gt;&gt; All right. Thanks again to Devin for coming on to the channel. I love his story because he's proof that you can build a really nice business from anywhere in the world. That's the power of building apps and software, especially in this crazy AI wave we're going through right now. And shameless plug, that's exactly why we created Starter Story Build, our program where we guide you on how to use AI to go from an idea to an app in just a few days. In very little time, you could build something that solves a real problem and ship it to real users. So, if you're interested in that, head to the first link in the description and check out Starter Story Build. Thank you guys for watching. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: Our simple app made $100K in 90 days
VIDEO ID: 1nfPvJKrYYQ
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nfPvJKrYYQ
================================================================================

A few weeks ago, I came across a tweet that blew my mind. This app got $250,000 downloads and made $100,000 in revenue in just three months. &gt;&gt; First months, uh, $41K, second months, $32K, and third months, $27K. &gt;&gt; So, in typical fashion, I reached out to the founder to see if I could uncover how, and he responded with something that I couldn't believe. Once it gets we start getting a lot of sales immediately. &gt;&gt; Him and his friend Yini did it all from their bedrooms in Europe with a single Tik Tok account. &gt;&gt; In the beginning, we didn't expect like this video will reach 4 million views. &gt;&gt; I had to know more. So, I brought them onto the channel to share everything. And in this video, we'll go over the AI app that they built, their step-by-step Tik Tok marketing playbook that made them $100,000 in three months, and they'll break down their most viral Tik Toks, and share the special sauce that generated millions of views. This one's going to be fun. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. [Music] All right, real quick guys, before you meet Yavghini and Nikita, I just want to mention that this was the first time that they were sharing their story on any podcast. English isn't their first language and they were a little bit nervous to come on here, but they worked really, really hard to give you guys as much value as possible, which I think is really cool and hopefully you guys enjoy the video. All right, Nikita and Yini, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you guys are, what you built, and what's your story. I'm Nikita based in Serbia &gt;&gt; and I'm based in Poland. &gt;&gt; Together we built an AI writing tool called natural right &gt;&gt; and in just 3 months we took this app from zero to $100k in revenue and we did it all from a single Tik Tok account. &gt;&gt; All right. So tell me a little bit more about natural, right? What exactly is it and who's using this? &gt;&gt; You know concept is super simple. So user just passed a generated text, click humanize button and receive 100% human written text and this text usually bypass most AI detectors and mostly it's popular in schools in universities for students but it's also used in businesses for marketers you know most interesting thing here is that we came to that idea a little bit you know randomly so during our research we noticed that there are so many videos about humanizers and I just thought that okay we can do the same it's much easier to promote it on Tik Tok because it's hot topic and we decided okay let's go two weeks we make a product start promoting it and it's it worked out yeah &gt;&gt; I think that's really cool kind of finding an idea from a growth first strategy and that's one of the big reasons I wanted to bring you on the channel is that you really did all this in the last 3 months so I'd love to hear more about that growth story how do you go from basically no idea to getting something with serious traction. &gt;&gt; Uh firstly we tried hiring uh influencers and paying them to make videos for us but it was unsuccessful experience because they generated just some views and almost no conversions. So after that we decided to create our own accounts on Tik Tok and we started filming ourselves. We started posting videos every day. Just from the first video, we got the first sale. But after that, things started to snowball. So, first months $41K, second months $32K, and third months $27K and total uh $100k in revenue. &gt;&gt; Nice. I like that. You guys really focused on growth. you really focus on Tik Tok and you had a pretty unique approach to tackling Tik Tok from a programmer's mindset. Can you tell me a little bit more about your strategy? &gt;&gt; So, our approach is pretty simple. So, first you properly set up your account. Then you just find viral videos from your niche. Then you just make copies of that videos. Then you post one video per day. Uh and finally, once you go viral, start testing your own unique ideas. I like that strategy, but I think for a lot of people watching this, and I'm also curious to know like let's get into the details on this, can you really break down this Tik Tok marketing strategy in full? &gt;&gt; Uh, yeah, sure. Step one, do your niche research before you even start coding because you need to find proofs. Proof that you have competitors on Tik Tok and proof that these competitors have viral videos on Tik Tok as well. Tik Tok search is your best friend and creator search insights also on Tik Tok is your best friend too. Step two, create a Tik Tok account. So if you are not in your target location, you need to buy a VPN, you need a iPhone, phone number from your target location, uh a new email, a new Apple ID. It is very important your first Tik Tok account should be uh registered on your phone number. And step three, warm up. You have to spend 50, 30 minutes a day for three five days engaging with content in your niche. So like videos, leave comments, follow creators, use search to find uh videos in your niche. And step four, recreate what works. Start by making one to one highquality copies of viral videos in your niche. It is very important to add captions in Tik Tok editor as well. Step five, posting. Start with posting just one video per day at optimal time for your target audience. So, usually it will be the second half of the day. And step six, innovate. when your videos start uh going viral and you figure out how everything works on Tik Tok. So, you can probably begin experimenting with your own ideas and your own formats on Tik Tok. Step seven, scale. Once you having success and getting views, you can scale your operation by creating more accounts and hiring creators. Before we keep going, I got to call out something I'm seeing with a lot of founders right now. You're moving fast, maybe close to product market fit, or you're prepping for your next round. This feels amazing, but then enterprise prospects start asking about security compliance, and suddenly everything slows down. The reality, well, in 2025, especially with AI, security expectations hit earlier and harder than ever. You can either get ahead of it or let it become the thing that kills your momentum. And that brings me to Vanta, today's sponsor, which basically solves this entire headache. Instead of spending months figuring out SOCK 2 compliance, Vanta's automated workflows gets you audit ready fast. And here's what I think is really cool. It's not just a one-time setup. Vanta keeps monitoring and updating as you scale. Fast-growing startups like Langchain, Writer, and Cursor trusted Vanta to build their security foundation early, which meant they could focus on growth instead of getting stuck in compliance hell. Right now, Vanta's offering $1,000 off for Starter Story viewers. If you want to check it out, you can go to vanta.com/starterstory or click the first link in the description. Over 12,000 companies are already using Vanta to scale smarter. Huge thanks to Vanta for partnering with us. I love what you guys are doing. All right, let's dive back in. That's a very nice playbook. What I'd love to see from you guys is the actual examples. Would you be able to pull up your most successful Tik Tok videos that led to the most downloads and customers? &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. The first one is you have an asset to submit in 5 minutes and you know is just from a popular American comedy with Jim Carrey. There is the great video that exactly show the problem to users like okay you have just 1 minute you need to submit your essay and show them solution in very funny way. This video took couple of hours to make and in the beginning we didn't expect like this video will reach 4 million views. This format was already proven by other creators. So we just copy it and it works really well. Here is another example. In this case, we show exactly the problem like you have 100% generated text. You do this and you have like 100% human written text. Once it gets viral, we start getting a lot of sales immediately. Funny stuff here. That original video has around 150k views, but the copy from Yuini gets 1.5 million views. &gt;&gt; Thank you guys for showing those two examples. I think it's super cool to be able to see like what actually worked for you. So, I appreciate you guys showing those. You came up with and you executed on this Tik Tok strategy just a couple months ago. Break down some of the numbers for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah, sure. Uh, total views on Tik Tok is around 9 million views from all our accounts. Total visits around 300K. Signups 250K. Also, conversion rate from visit to sign up is around 80%. That is crazy. and revenue 100k. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wow, that's insane. 80% conversion to sign up ratio on your website is absolutely nuts. So, congrats on that. So, I'd love to hear how you guys actually built this app and what kind of tech stack you're using to build this. &gt;&gt; First, uh we'd like to mention that we have a third member of our team, Alexander, who takes care of all tech stuff. Our stack is pretty simple. NextJS, Postgress, Coolify, Next AL, plus resend, and our server cost $35 per month. Resend uh 20 bucks per month. And next we have VPN, so $5 per months per five devices. And US phone numbers, $5 per month per phone number. So other than cost of our time, uh the cost to run uh this business is very low. &gt;&gt; Thank you for sharing that. The last question that I want to ask both you guys, Nikita and Yini, when it comes to figuring out Tik Tok marketing, if you could stand on each other's shoulders just three months ago before you had a successful app, while you're trying to figure this out, what would be your advice? &gt;&gt; I would say that you need to start your Tik Tok journey by yourself. Try find out what works and only then start thinking about uh delegate or hiring other people. So just try it by yourself &gt;&gt; and also don't over complicate it. So skip inventing your own Tik Tok format and just replicate what's already going viral. I just want to say thank you again to Nikita and Yini for coming onto the channel. I know they were a little nervous and English wasn't their first language, but I think their Tik Tok strategy is awesome and hopefully you do too. Before I sign off, I do want to remind you to check out Starter Story Build. It's our program where in just a few weeks you'll build a real working project and you'll build it using only AI coding tools. Hundreds of people have joined Starter Story Build and launched their first projects. So if you're ready to get started, just head to the link in the description to join Starter Story Build.

TITLE: This app made over $1M
VIDEO ID: VfNRd5Rk0cM

================================================================================

I am the founder of Rooted. It's been downloaded over four million times and made over a million in revenue. &gt;&gt; Meet Anna. She built an iPhone app with no coding experience that's been downloaded over 4 million times. &gt;&gt; I don't have any technical background. So, I basically started taking what I thought would be helpful and I started drawing it out in a notebook. &gt;&gt; But what's more important than how she built it is how she found the idea. In my fourth year of university, I actually got a panic attack. &gt;&gt; In this episode, we dive into how Anya turned a very painful experience into an app that has generated over a million dollars. Specifically, Anna breaks down how to know if a problem you experience might be worth turning it into an app, how she built it without being an experienced app developer, and the four-step framework she used to get millions of users. Let's dive in. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. All right, welcome Anya to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; Hey, my name is Anya and I'm the founder of Rooted for Panic Attack and Anxiety Relief. Since launching in 2019, it's been downloaded over 4 million times and &gt;&gt; I mean, wow, that's insane. 4 million downloads on an app that you built. Can you tell me about how this all started? How you even came up with the idea to build something like this? Yeah, in my fourth year of university, I actually got a panic attack seemingly out of nowhere. I had no idea what they were before and I was far away from home. I had no family doctor and I really struggled to find the resources that I needed to get better. So, as I was looking through the app stores and looking online for something to help, I realized that there's nothing that really spoke to me. Things were really either clinical or there were hypnosis based apps and it just really wasn't what I was looking for. So that's why I figured I had something to launch here. &gt;&gt; I mean, I think what you did is awesome is that you actually had this personal problem, this very painful personal problem, and then you decided to build something. I guess my question is how'd you get the confidence to know that this was something worth building? How did you like validate that this could be something that could be big? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So my idea at the time was to download and try existing apps. And uh I noticed a common theme in the user reviews that there was this gap when it came to identifying what a panic attack is and also solutions for how to basically get through a panic attack in the moment. And I put together a really early version of Rooted, a prototype, an MVP type solution. And the first few hundred users said that even though there was still some lagging, some bugs, some incomplete parts, they really wanted me to keep going with it. And that was super encouraging. What would be your advice to someone who uh let's say they do have a personal problem like a painful problem like like mental health thing or or something like that. What would be your advice on how to like validate that this is something worth building? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd say if you are passionate about solving a problem then really launching with just an MVP to get that feedback out there. For me, I think I was just like obsessed with getting the idea out there and I really didn't then listen to the naysayers as much because I was like I need to prove this out myself. So, if you're confident that other people are experiencing your problem, it's worth just launching an MVP to see if what you've created will help them. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, perfect segue on that. Let's talk about how you built that MVP, how you built the first version of that app. I understand that you don't have a technical background. You're not a programmer or coder. How did you do it? How did you build something worth using? &gt;&gt; I basically started taking what I drawing it out in a notebook and I was thinking about the way I wanted the information to be presented. what would be most helpful for me in that moment of a panic attack. How do I keep things super simple in the app when somebody's really overwhelmed as they're using it? And so I took these ideas and sketches from my notebooks and then I taught myself how to basically create them as wireframes in Photoshop and Illustrator. And then yeah, I went to an agency and I could not afford to work with the agency. So that certainly set me back timewise. But then at one point a student developer said that he would love to work with me and so that's how I was able to finally launch that first MVP. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you could just give me a breakdown of you know how long this took, how much did you actually spend to get this prototype put together? What did that look like &gt;&gt; with the student developer? What I did was I just put in all my savings. You know, as a non-technical founder, it just took a few months once I actually had the developer. And that's because all of the content, all of the wireframes before then were already created. I did want to learn enough to at least be able to communicate what I wanted better. I just sort of focused a lot on the design, making sure all that was really simple. The first prototype of Rooted was essentially the panic attack button that would walk you through a panic attack. And that actually hasn't changed a ton over the years because it's really the core of Rooted. It's the aha moment that really resonates with users. What's changed is the design and the way it looks right now. But that core idea of how to stop a panic attack is still there and rooted after all these years. So I launched with that a simple breathing tool and then the lessons on how to understand panic attacks and anxiety and where they're coming from. &gt;&gt; All right. So you launched this, you built this, you're getting early traction. Now this is a huge app with millions of downloads. What did that growth timeline look like for you? How long did it take? &gt;&gt; So it started off quite slow. I'd say in the first year we reached around 10,000 downloads. It wasn't until year two or so that we reached a 100,000 downloads. And I remember after that, I guess we just knew that there was a real demand for it and kept going. And I hit a million downloads, I think, in year three. &gt;&gt; You mentioned just a second ago that you did this with a full-time job. How did you do that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So when I first started Rooted, I was working 4 days a week and I had told my employers at the time that I was starting Rooted. I'm doing this like Rooted 3 days a week and this other job 4 days a week. So I basically had no weekends or social life for quite a few years. I don't think there's any shortcuts though. I think that's just something I had to go through. &gt;&gt; Tell me about that decision to go full-time on Rooted. What did that look like? &gt;&gt; So I had already been wanting to do it for probably a year before I did it. Uh revenue was there. it could sustain me comfortably for over a year. Yeah, it really happened when there was a lot of shifts at the other job and it just became a lot less enjoyable and I just decided that now is time. That was about 3 years ago now, so maybe 2 and 1/2 to 3 years into rooted. &gt;&gt; All right, before we get back to Anya's story, let's talk about where it all started. Anya didn't have a business background or app development experience. She just had a painful personal problem and decided to build a solution for herself. And that simple decision became a million-dollar app. This is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build. It's our flagship program where you'll learn to build and launch your project using AI coding tools, even if you have zero coding experience. In just a few weeks, you'll go from idea to a working production app just like Anya did. So, if you're ready to turn your problem into your next project, head to the link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. All right, let's get back to the episode. All right, let's jump into the growth side of things. I know that you grew this app from zero to 4 million plus downloads. What are some of the tactics or maybe the top three things when it comes to growing a mobile or an iPhone app? First, it was active social media engagement, but I remember that I used to spend literal hours going through posts, writing helpful comments, leaving links back to Rooted, and really trying to be helpful in what I wrote. Secondly, I would say press releases. In the early days, I didn't want to be even known as like the anxiety girl. I didn't want that to like define me. Then I realized, you know, once you actually put your name to a story, it does resonate better with the audiences. I would find people online, journalists that wrote about mental health and then I would read it reach out to them either on LinkedIn or try to get their email and send pitches that way. It was a ton of work because not many people would ever respond to me. But what ended up happening is every now and then we'd get featured in a pretty major way for small apps. So we were in Cosmopolitan, we've been in Women's Health, we were even in Time magazine which was the big one. All of that really happened from these organic cold emails. And then the third thing would be a huge focus on app store optimization. So I focused a lot on making sure that the product matches what the users are looking for. They see on your product page. They download the app, they use it, and then they use the same keywords to describe their experience via the user reviews. That was like the holy circle. And if you can get that loop going, it I think it's a really strong presence for app store optimization. &gt;&gt; That's great. And would you have any advice for how to be helpful in 2025? You probably talked to a lot of people that are just starting to build apps. What's your advice on being helpful and doing something similar to what you did? &gt;&gt; I'd say not leading with, hey, this is my app. Go download it, but actually maybe even answering something like a question online that your app answers. I would almost take something like from a rooted lesson. So, let's say there's somebody makes a post saying that, you know, they had this like horrible experience with anxiety on a run today. Then I could like kind of share like why that might have happened and why, you know, it's normal. it's okay and whatnot. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, beyond the tactics which we talked a little bit about, I want to know now, you know, what's the bigger strategy? What does it take to build a successful app in 2025? What would be your playbook that you'd give to someone who is just starting out today? &gt;&gt; Right. So, step one, build a product that actually delivers what your page promises. That'll lead not only to more positive downloads, aka like people leaving positive experiences, but people will also then share it. and like the word of mouth engagement is quite important. Step two, listen to your users. So user reviews are super important. Oftentimes everything you need to know is written in the user reviews and sometimes your own assumption of what a user needs might not actually be what they do need. Step three, optimize app store presence continuously. Doing a release frequently shows that you continue to work on the app. I do one once every week and that shows that you're constantly working on fixing bugs, improving the user experience. And step four, partner strategically. So be that a wellness organization, um we've done a few B2B contracts as well, a ton of different therapy groups and psychologist offices are recommending and using Rooted and this has been something that's been helpful now in 2025. One thing that I'm curious about as someone who's built a really successful app, also helped a lot of people build successful apps. What is like the most important metrics to be tracking? Is it revenue downloads? What is it? &gt;&gt; Well, for me, and I think especially being in the mental health space, it's been about user reviews. So, our rating, we've been able to maintain a 4.8 out of five rating. And this is really, really important to me. users leave comments about how Rooted has helped them go back to work, go back to school, and just reclaim confidence in their lives. We've also realized that based on usage that we're able to now take a panic attack and users are feeling better from the panic attack within under 2 minutes. It's just been really exciting to to work on that and kind of see really how effective Rooted is and what users say about it. I think actually our focus on tracking user reviews and the quality of rooted over revenue has been a big factor as to why we've grown. &gt;&gt; All right, so we talked all about how you built this app, how you came up with the idea, how you grew it to millions of users. Can we see the app? How does it actually work? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, when you first open the app, you're greeted with this blue app mascot named Ron. The main feature here is if you're in the middle of a panic attack, you'll see this red button. This is an SOS button. And it'll basically ask you how you're feeling based on either wanting to feel okay in the moment or wanting to face the panic attack head-on. And it walks you through these prompts which help to essentially activate the parasympathetic nervous system. And the parasympathetic nervous system is the one that calms us down. There's also this tool for deep breathing. And probably my favorite features are these lessons. They're actually lessons on understanding anxiety, what the physical mental effects are, the causes and theories and so forth. We also have a journal tool where you can kind of share what your feelings are, share what you've accomplished, what's weighing you down, what you're grateful for. We also have over 100 visualizations and sleep sounds. And then most recently, we have a games tool. And these are supposed to be really simple, relaxing games. Users have asked for this for many years. So the idea is for the games to be really simple things that you can play when you are on a plane or in a busy subway. Just things to kind of distract you when you're feeling a little anxious in the moment. Now that we have as many downloads as we have, whenever I launch something, I almost instantly like within a week I get to see thousands of people use it, right? So that's just been incredible. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, thank you for showing me that. I think what you built is awesome and it's an amazing tool for millions of people to use. You've done it. You built an app. It's really successful. You quit your full-time job. You do this for a living now. Uh what would be your advice to someone who's maybe just starting out, maybe they've just started building an app or they have an idea for an app. What would be your advice to someone who's starting out? &gt;&gt; I would suggest that you listen to users very closely. They will have the answers you need. They'll help you know what to focus on. And I believe, especially in the mental health space, at the end of the day, that's who we're most responsible. Launching Rooted with the MVP and getting that original feedback. I mean, to this day, I still read all the user reviews, even though I have somebody else do the responses now. I still go in and I make sure I know what's going on and just to have a pulse on what users are saying. I'd also recommend taking care of yourself along the way. I think there were definitely quite a few points where I almost reached burnout. I was building something really intense and that level of intensity was with me at all times. And I think I looking back I wish I celebrated a few of the smaller moments more because now I realize that those were like the most awesome moments whereas really I was just focus on the next thing and ready to get to the next thing. So I would recommend taking care of yourself and also celebrating the small wins. &gt;&gt; Well, thank you Ana for coming on to the channel. I think what you built is awesome. I'm so excited to share it with all of our subscribers on YouTube. I think what you built is really needed in the world. So thanks for coming on. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much for having me. &gt;&gt; Thanks again to Ana for coming on to the channel. Personally, I loved hearing about how she grew rooted from just a painful personal problem, like a panic attack, into an app that's been made over a million dollars. But reminder, it all started from finding that simple problem and building something. You can't skip that step if you want to build something that could potentially change your life. And this is exactly why we launched Starter Story Build. We'll help you take a problem from your own life and turn it into a working app using only AI tools. So, if you're ready to build and launch your app, just head to the first link in the description to check out Starter Story Build. That's it for this episode. Let me know what you think in the comments. Thank you again for watching. We'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: How I Built a $10K/Month SaaS (Beginner Strategy)
VIDEO ID: _KaFS4Dxs5k
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KaFS4Dxs5k
================================================================================

I met a guy who has the perfect strategy for finding micro SASS ideas. &gt;&gt; I think anyone can build a business like mine. &gt;&gt; And with this simple strategy, he's been able to build a pretty successful business. &gt;&gt; Today, EUFO makes 11,000 MR. &gt;&gt; He didn't need to come up with a brand new idea. He didn't need a crazy marketing strategy. He just focused on one simple thing. I think anyone can copy this strategy to make their first $10,000. and I had Abby Shake come on the channel and break down this strategy step by step. &gt;&gt; In my opinion, the best approach to build a SAS is &gt;&gt; in this video, we'll go over where to start looking for ideas, how to identify if one is worth working on, and how to get your first customer without actually building anything. I think you're going to like this one. Let's dive in. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, welcome Abby Shake to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built and what's your story. &gt;&gt; My name is Abhishek and I built EUform. It's an alternative to Typeform. I launched it in 2023 and over last 2 years we have grown it to around 11,000 MR now. &gt;&gt; Okay. So immediately I just want to get into it right away. I think your approach is super cool kind of finding this big idea building a small version of it. Can you tell me about how you even came up with the idea on how to do this? I was working on my previous SAS which was a no code chatbot builder. It was called Bflow and it had 200 users or so. So majority of them were using it because they wanted a conversational form. And when I talked to them and found that they were using it as an alternative to Typhone, I found that Tyform recently uh raised their pricing. So then I found there was like a gap in the market. But pricing is something that I found like that can't be the only reason. So I then searched Twitter, Reddit, Typhform's own forum and all. I found there are like some other features as well that users want and Typhoon is not providing. So then I solved uh that chatbot builder botflow and started working on new form. &gt;&gt; Okay. I mean you just talked about it right there. You called it finding the gap. What do you mean exactly by that? &gt;&gt; Finding the gap is something where you can you know take something which is already working. people are using it but there are some gaps like uh some pain points people are not finding with the current competitors. If you can fill that gap you can definitely get users. I think like most of our developers think most of the ideas or most of things have already built in the market right but there is always a gap. &gt;&gt; Thank you for sharing that. I mean I just love this strategy taking a big idea building a really small version of it maybe even undercutting the prices building other features. Tell me about why you think other people watching this should adopt this approach as well. build a SAS is you should not invent things. As a indie hacker, as a bootstrap, you can't create the next Uber. You can't create the next Facebook. You need a lot of money for that in your BC funding. In fact, you should approve the market which is already validated like there are already big players there. So, people are actually using it and then just find the gap. Okay, let's take a deeper dive into the finding the gap strategy. Can you break down this strategy so that someone watching could think about how they could do something similar? &gt;&gt; The idea is simple. Step one, you look for a popular tool and search social platforms like Twitter and Reddit with keywords like X alternative where X is basically the product with lots of users. So for in my case, it was type form. Then step two, find the pain points or gaps which they are not solving. It is fine if the pain point is pricing but only if pricing is too high. Then step three reach out to those users with your solution with just a basic landing page explaining your solution. So messaging is the key here. And bonus point step four have a tool to simply easily migrate your competitor's user to your platform with a one click. In Uformm we have a landing page where you can paste your type form URL and it will generate a U form within few seconds. So people can see like okay uh this is what we are getting in. &gt;&gt; Okay cool. So I mean that's that's an awesome strategy. You're a busy founder. You don't have time to go build other things. But people watching this might be wondering okay how can I do this strategy right now? What are the big hundred million dollar companies out there that I can kind of go do the same thing you did? So what would be your advice or ideas you have around that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So there are uh lots of opportunities there which I would love to build but I don't have time to do. Two of them which I can state right away. One is getting alternative. This is the my personal pain point I have faced because we are small startup and Kenny has recently trying to go up market. So I searched for a lot of Cany alternative in the market but none as simple as cany. Apart from that there is a one gap that I found recently. This is an app where you can build your forest the digital forest by doing some habits. And why you should build an alternative right now is if you search with the latest reviews there most of them are one star. I think these are the things that you should do but you will find that there are people who say that okay Facebook is crap I I don't want to go there but definitely don't build things like a social media and marketplace or something that is something that as an indie hacker you should always stay on &gt;&gt; all right before we wrap up with Abby Shakes's story I wanted to pop in with a question what do you want to build no seriously what project have you been thinking about for a long time maybe it's a microSAS like the one we're talking about today or Maybe it's just a simple tool that will help you be more productive. Whatever it is, AI has made it possible to build anything. But let's be honest, it's still really hard to figure out where to start. I get DMs every single day from people asking me how to build, what to build, and what tools to actually use. So, I decided to create something that makes it easier for you to build with AI. It's called Starter Story Build, and it's our program where in just a few days, you'll go from a simple idea to a productionready app. You'll get guidance from our resonant experts and you'll get the road map for how to build with AI forever. Honestly, I wish this existed when I was just starting out. So, if you're curious, check out the link in the description to learn more about Starter Story Build. All right, let's get back to the episode. I'd love to learn a little bit more about you form and just walk me a little bit through kind of how you built it. Just give me a highle overview of like what you did until you got the first paying customer and so on. So my approach was simple. I uh didn't actually made like all the features that Tyform was providing. So we initially didn't do anything which might be like a fancy landing page or a logo or anything that like that. The first version of Euform had just you can collect some data using like fields like name, email, star rating and all. And uh apart from that you can just download your uh data as a CSV. There was no integrations with Google sheet API etc. Nothing was available there. So this was an MVB that I think uh I built in 2 weeks and the landing page was a basic landing page that time which just had a start using uh EU which used to take you to the EU build and later on like my wife created the current page when we got like I guess 200 plus users. &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. I mean that's awesome. The next question that I have is around some of the numbers behind it. I know you're super transparent about that stuff. So how's the business going and and share with me some of the numbers? Yeah, currently we are doing around 11,000 MR and there are around 35,000 or so users, registered users and paying customers is around 500 something. We are actually basically done a premium model I guess 90% plus of features are free. So our conversion rate is around somewhere around 1.5 to less than 2%. traffic per month we get around 35,000 visitors per month unique visitors and apart from that a good stat right now is we have recently crossed 4 million form submissions &gt;&gt; cool well thanks for sharing that uh what tech stack did you use to build this business and what tools do you use on daily basis &gt;&gt; yeah so is built on Laravel I chose Laravel basically because I love it I'm working on this since last I guess 10 years so I wanted to keep the stag which I'm comfortable with and it is hosted on AWS Amazon AWS We use cloudflare for security and um storage. Apart from that stripe for payments. Uh we use open AI uh a lot for fraud detection because our premium model lots of bad users comes in who tries to get the system. Then we use slite for help docs. They are great. Apart from the Gmail for bugspace, simple analytics for web analytics, carry for feedback management and mail gun for email. Then in total I think our last month expense was around less than $1,200. Next question I have is you know you built this successful business. What have been some of the most surprising lessons that you've learned along the journey? &gt;&gt; First of all the messaging is important with your app. The message about what your product does should resonate with basically your ideal customer. After that it is all about how good your product is and uh your customer support which will not only keep your existing customers but they will also refer others to your product. And the last question is, if you could stand on Abby Shakes's shoulder before you had this successful business, this amazing SAS business that you built, what would be your advice to yourself or to people watching this who want to do something similar? If you are young, take risk early because you have less responsibilities and don't neglect marketing. That is important thing. Apart from that, I would say don't build things because you can. If you really want a SAS business to support your lifestyle, then I think you should first search for what people are looking for and then build it. &gt;&gt; Well, that's great advice. Thank you, Abishek, for coming on. I love the business that you built and I hope to see you at 100,000 MR. &gt;&gt; Thank you, V. Thanks a lot, &gt;&gt; man. I just loved hearing about how Abbyek thinks about building apps. I think this strategy is cool because it's very approachable. There are a lot of lowhanging fruit out there that exists like this where you can go find a big company, figure out what users like and dislike, and then build that micro version of it. It's not necessarily easy, but the strategy is pretty simple, and I think it's very doable. And with tools like Lovable and Cursor, you can spin up these projects and get started and have a real working prototype in just a few hours. And that's exactly why we built and launched Starter Story Build. In a few days, you'll learn how to build stuff with AI. And who knows, in a few months, you might have your own $10,000 per month microsass. If you're interested in Starter Story Build, head to the first link in the description to learn more. Thank you again for watching. I'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: My Side Project Makes $15K/Month (Quit My 9-5)
VIDEO ID: ZGwQoRw7mh8
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGwQoRw7mh8
================================================================================

My name is Ben and I turned my side project into a full-time job. &gt;&gt; This is Ben, a regular dude in a regular 9 to-5 who always wanted to start his own business. He was always starting different side projects, but nothing really worked until one day he changed his entire approach. &gt;&gt; Don't go full-time on your project until you do this. &gt;&gt; Once he made this change, he started a business that would eventually hit 15,000 MR and allow him to work full-time on his own stuff. The idea finally started to get traction when I brought Ben onto the channel to share everything, including what he learned from all his failed side project ideas, why this idea was different, and how with the right approach, anybody can build a side project that makes money. All right, let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, welcome Ben to Starter Story. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; My name is Ben Boz and I'm a software developer who created Tech Lockdown. Tech Lockdown is a platform that helps adults block websites and apps and just be more intentional with their internet use. It started out as a side project, but I was actually laid off in 2023, and I had to make the decision to either go full-time on my side project or accept a job offer and go back into working full-time. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, let's go a little bit deeper into how Tech Lockdown works. What does this app do and how does it work? &gt;&gt; The core part of the platform is the content policy which lets you schedule when websites and apps are blocked and you can use categories or keywords to instantly block millions of websites and apps. But then once you set that up, you connect to your devices using a VPN connection. You know, your smartphone or your computer is now using like a filtered internet connection. &gt;&gt; Cool. What type of people use Tech Lockdown? What's like your typical user? So my typical user as an adult, they're just trying to be more careful with how they use the internet and they might have developed unwanted habits or compulsive behaviors. The business model is typical SAS subscription. I have a 14-day free trial which allows people to try things out, set things up, and decide if it's a good fit. And then from there, they either pay $15 monthtomonth or they pay basically $10 a month if they pay for an annual plan. Ultimately, I want people to buy an annual plan, but a lot of people give up after like a month. So, I provide that option. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, one of the things that I really think is cool about your story, you had a full-time job, and this was a side project. Have you always been building side projects? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, ever since, you know, in college, I was doing side projects, messing around with stuff, even when I had a full-time job, and I just could never shut that side of my brain off. So, the first failed side project was I made a lead generation platform for freelance developers to help them find clients. and I just got way too obsessive over like the colors on the website and the logo and the the name of it and I just didn't think about the business model enough or how I would get customers. So, it just didn't go anywhere. The next thing I worked on was a landing page builder. This time I wasn't obsessed, but I didn't really think about how I'd launch it and I burnt myself out before launching it. I over complicated it and it didn't go anywhere. And then I ended up co-founding a web agency with a designer and another developer. did that for about 2 and 1/2 years, but it was just really difficult, a hard business to run. Ultimately, I was glad when we ended that business. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you had a few kind of failed side projects that didn't work out. How did you come up with the idea for tech lockdown? &gt;&gt; Well, it ultimately started back in 2020 when work from home became normalized and everyone was just getting way too much internet time. So, I decided to set up guard rails around my own internet use. I found out that it's just really hard to do that. So, I I spent a ton of time researching and kind of putting together my own system that would work well for me. And then from that, I just distilled that into a a YouTube video and a Reddit post. And I was shocked by how many people were messaging me and emailing me and asking me to consult and all these things. But at that point, I actually didn't start monetizing it at all. Kept creating free content and building my audience. About a year later is when I actually monetized it. &gt;&gt; All right. So, you had built this side project. It's doing well. it has paying customers and then something crazy happens. What happened? &gt;&gt; Well, I got laid off and I had kind of already planned to leave in September of that year, but I had to figure out all these things like how do you pay for health insurance? How expensive is that? The income from tech lockdown was like $3,000 at that point, which would not have covered my expenses. My natural instinct was to to go back to this like safety net, which is a W2 income. But I figured I'm only going to get this opportunity probably once. Let me give it a good shot. And at least I know that if I go back and I do an interview somewhere, I bet I could get another job. I ended up doubling down on Tech Lockdown, and I'm glad I did that because it's grown by 5x uh since I was laid off. &gt;&gt; What do you think was different about Tech Lockdown as a side project compared to your previously failed side projects? &gt;&gt; Well, I think the first thing is that I didn't start off trying to make a side project. It was genuinely something that I was passionate about and I was trying to solve a problem. I also didn't over complicate the logo and the marketing and all that. I actually didn't have a logo until I had a few hundred customers. So, I was just laser focused on if I have any free time, it's got to go towards the most meaningful stuff. It was actually really helpful to have an audience who was really focused on that topic, too. So, that when I actually worked on something, I felt like I I wasn't just like throwing something out there into the ether. I knew that someone would use it eventually. So, it was it was really motivating compared to what I was doing before. I know a lot of people watching this right now might have a full-time job. They're figuring out how do I find the time to build? What should I work on? What hours of the day should I work? Can you break down a little bit more tactically about how you built this business with limited time and energy? &gt;&gt; I've formed a habit of waking up really early in the morning, prioritizing like development tasks and stuff that just required more focus and attention in the morning. So, I would do that, you know, between like 5:30 and 8:00, 8:30. And then if I worked on anything in the evening, it might be more like marketing related because I could do those kinds of tasks without having to be hyperfocused and alert. And I also stayed really focused on a specific marketing strategy. If you're juggling a full-time job and you're also trying to do customer acquisition through marketing, you should pick a channel that is energizing to you and that you can do reliably and that you don't dread doing. So for me, that was content marketing, but for other people it literally might be knocking on doors, talking to customers face to face. It just depends on on your personality. &gt;&gt; That's awesome. Thanks for sharing all that. For anyone watching this right now who has a side project or they're thinking about starting a side project and they have a full-time job, what would be your advice to them? &gt;&gt; I'd say make sure that you have a way to get customers. I think the customer acquisition problem is a thing you have to solve before you leave your job. And you have to have a plan that you can kind of throw gasoline on, right? If I have 40 hours a week to throw at this, I know that there's going to be an extra output. I wouldn't start a side project just because you hate your job and you just want to work for yourself. It's really not that glamorous being your own boss. If you have a problem with your job, maybe just make your full-time job getting a better one. Start a side project when it's something you're genuinely passionate about, but you would almost work on for free if you couldn't make money with it. All right, before we finish Ben's story, I want to speak directly to anyone watching this who's stuck in a 9 to5 and thinking, "I want to build something, too. I just don't know where to start." The truth is, there's never been a better time to start a side project. And thanks to AI, you don't need to spend months learning how to code. This is why we created Starter Story Build. It's our accelerator that helps you go from idea to working product in just a couple weeks. We'll show you how to guide AI to build the app for you. Skip the tutorials and actually launch something real and stay focused and accountable inside a cohort of other builders. Ben's story is proof. Side projects can change your life, but you have to start. And Starter Story Build is the best place to do that. If you're interested, just click the first link in the description to join. I hope to see you in there. Now, let's get back to Ben's story. All right. Well, let's take a dive into ideas. You started a bunch of side project ideas. A lot of them failed and one was really successful. What would be your playbook or strategy for finding a good side project idea? For one thing, I would pick an idea that you can make a very simple version of that's still complete that you can use to validate and bring to market quickly. If the idea that you're picking is going to take you 2 years to build, there's no simplified version that you can release, I'm not sure that I would do it. Another thing I would do is start off by building an audience, don't wait to have the product before you build the audience. And it needs to be an audience that's interested in that topic, not just like your general social media following. you need to have like a pretty good customer list of pre-qualified people that would use it. Then you'll you'll have something uh an audience to launch to once you're ready with a simplified version of your product. If you have limited free time and energy, you need to not dread waking up early in the morning to work on your side project. It needs to be something you're genuinely passionate and excited about so that at the end of a long workday, you're not like resentful of this thing that you're working on. You're excited and ready to go. and maybe you're even thinking about it during the workday because it's just something you're genuinely into. &gt;&gt; Okay, great. Can you break down some of the numbers behind this business? How big is it? How much money is it making? &gt;&gt; In the last 2 years, there have been over 2 million people that have found the site organically either through Google search or or referrals or social channels. I have 1,300 customers that generate over 15,000 in monthly recurring revenue. And then I have a mailing list with around 20,000 contacts. &gt;&gt; All right, cool. So I mean that's an amazing business that you built. Let's talk about actually how you grew that business. What was the growth and marketing strategy to go from zero to 15K MR? &gt;&gt; So my core strategy was just to write really well researched and helpful content. I'm going to give it away for free and it made it really easy for people to just share the stuff that I was writing. I made a a guide on how you can convert an iPhone into a dumb phone cuz I know there's this audience of of people that are just kind of fed up with their smartphone and they're tired of being addicted to it. So, I basically showed with a a really detailed step-by-step guide how you can make it so that you can only access like a few key apps on your iPhone and like you can't even use Safari or anything like that. That article alone, it's one of the top performing guides that I've ever published and it's been read hundreds of thousands of times. I also developed this a kind of a system or an approach at least that I could use when promoting content or videos on Reddit. And the thing with Reddit is you can't be overly promotional. So you have to be a little bit more subtle. So if I made like a YouTube video or I made a guide, I would put like all of the good stuff in that Reddit post. I would kind of just tack on a reference to like the YouTube video or the guide. But what I found was more people engaged with it. So it was more likely to go to the front page. And then at the same time, there's a lot of people that want to explore the topic further and they figure if you've got some other resource, you probably are talking about other things. So I think that's why that that ends up working. &gt;&gt; Okay. Well, thank you for sharing those. Is there a specific strategy or framework that you have when with creating content and what creates successful content? &gt;&gt; I think a big part of it is authenticity. A lot of my competitors are kind of these faceless apps or companies. They look really corporate but maybe don't look so trustworthy. And especially if you're doing a side project, people don't know who you are. You're not a big company. And it helps to just put your face on it and own what you're building. And then when I write about content, I'm not saying we, I'm saying I. I'm not pretending to be a big company when it's just me working on a project. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, let's get into the fun stuff. Techstack. What are the tools, languages, frameworks, and apps that you use to run this business? &gt;&gt; So, a lot of my tech stack decisions were based on time constraints. So, a lot of my early decisions were things like using Superbase for the for the database and authentication. And then I would use uh simpler web application frameworks like speltkit which is a little more accessible if you're just a JavaScript developer and you don't go too far into react land. I was using forcell for hosting even though you could do it cheaper yourself. Uh $20 a month is well worth it to have the peace of mind and a continuous deployment system. I think the most important part of my stack was actually the email provider. I use Mail Gun and Elastic Email. I think I ended up paying about $150 a month, but I email a lot of people. I pay for Google Gemini. I pay for like the light plan for ah refs. I use Plausible Analytics. Plausible is just an amazing analytics tool that I I check daily. It's probably one of the more important optional things that I pay for and a lot of the costs are just on the tech stack side of things. Infrastructure tends to be really cheap, but all in all, like you should be able to hit a 70% profit margin easily with all the optional stuff added in. &gt;&gt; All right. So, one of the last questions I want to ask you is, you know, you built a bunch of side projects. What have you learned through building these that surprised you? &gt;&gt; It's actually not that hard to make money with a side project. The hard part is making it into a viable business. There's a lot of side projects that are basically just selling a dollar for 90 and when they actually go to scale, it doesn't work out and they can't take it to be a full-time job. It's less about being really innovative or inventive. It's just coming up with a smart strategy where your customer acquisition cost is low enough that you can build it into a sustainable business and grow it outside of just yourself. The last question I want to ask you is if you could stand on Ben's shoulder when you were starting all those side projects, when you finally started that successful one, what advice would you give to young Ben? &gt;&gt; Uh to not over complicate things and find the simplest version of the product to prove the concept first. Getting bogged down in the details leads to burnout and not actually shipping the product. What you'll find with a lot of side projects is no one ever actually sees it because it it never gets shipped. So, distill it down to the core feature set, test it, build an audience, but don't over complicate it. &gt;&gt; Well, that's great advice. Thank you, Ben, for coming on the channel. I love the business you built, solopreneur, building it all yourself. It's amazing. Congrats and hope to see you on the channel again. &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me, Pat. &gt;&gt; I love Ben's story because it's something that anybody watching this video can do, too. He was just a regular guy with an idea, but the difference was he decided to actually go and build it. He started it on the side, grew it slowly, and eventually went allin. That goes to show you that sometimes all you need is the willingness to just put in the work. So, I want to challenge you. It's time to start building your side project. And the perfect place to start doing that is inside Starter Story Build. We'll show you how to go from a simple idea to a real working app in just a couple weeks. Hundreds of people have joined and started launching their first apps. It's really cool to see. So, if you're interested in taking on that challenge, head to the link in the description and check out Starter Story Build. All right, thank you guys for watching. I'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: I make $40K/month with this one website
VIDEO ID: EF3uyvHHBfM
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF3uyvHHBfM
================================================================================

I built a simple website that makes 40K a month. This is Angus Chang. He lives in Hong Kong and he built the simplest website I've ever seen. &gt;&gt; I built a website that literally does one thing. &gt;&gt; And what's even crazier is that he operates this business entirely as a solopreneur. Solo founder, zero employees, 100% bootstrapped. &gt;&gt; I bootstrapped this entire business by myself. &gt;&gt; I brought Angus onto the channel and he broke down how he found a silly idea that thousands of people also happen to need. why spending money on ads actually hurt his business and why having a big strategy is for losers. All right, let's dive in. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, welcome Angus to the channel. Thank you for coming on. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. &gt;&gt; My name is Angus Chang. I built a business that does just one thing. I launched it in 2021 and today it makes $40,000 a month and I run it entirely by myself. All right, before we get into the numbers of this amazing business that you built, I want to hear how did you come up with the idea for Bank Statement Converter? &gt;&gt; I had just quit my job and I knew I was going to build some sort of product. I actually had planned to build something else. But on the side, I was thinking, you know, I've got X amount of money in the bank. I want to know how long I can continue living the way I'm living. And to do that, I wanted multiple years of bank data. I wanted it all in a nice Excel spreadsheet so I can kind of figure out, okay, it looks like I'm spending this much a month. And that was a lot harder than I thought it would be because my bank only provided PDF bank statements. So, I wrote some code to get the transaction data out of the bank statements and that was also really hard. So, I figured it must be a real problem. &gt;&gt; Okay, you found the idea. Lots of people have ideas all the time. How did you know that this could be a business? &gt;&gt; Often I like to just make an MVP as quickly as possible, get it into production and then get it in front of real users. And that's kind of what I did. So, me and a friend worked on it for about a week. We got a domain, we launched it, and then we bought Google ads to get people to start clicking into the domain. And immediately people started uploading bank statements, which kind of validated the problem. You know, &gt;&gt; I think a lot of people watching this will be looking for how do I find a simple idea? How do I find this kind of app that can do one thing? I can build it myself and it can become a business. Do you have any sort of framework or strategy around finding these ideas? &gt;&gt; I think a good way is if you encounter the problem yourself or a painoint yourself. Another way is your colleagues or friends complain about stuff at work. But sometimes I just get ideas and I just think of the smallest possible way to implement that idea. You know, get it out there and see if people will use it. You can try to validate before launching, but if it takes you like one or two weeks to make an MVP, it's not that much of a risk anyway. So, you might as well just build it. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, we talked about finding the idea, but I want to hear more about how you actually built this thing. How did you go from idea to real live website? &gt;&gt; When I proved this out, I had a local version that would work for my own bank. I wrote this in Cotlin. It was basically a console application. And then I generalized it a bit so that it would work with other bank statements. Like obviously I don't know if it works for every bank statement but I tried it out with some of my other banks and some of my friends banks and then I convinced a friend to help me build the UI for this and he did this in Nex.js and then we got the two things deployed. I got the front end on Netifi. I deployed the back end to uh EC2 on AWS and that's kind of how we did it. &gt;&gt; Cool. You probably build a bunch of other apps and you learned a lot in the process of what works and what doesn't. What's your kind of framework for building? What's the Angus method? &gt;&gt; It's kind of like a lean startup approach. you know, you make an MVP, launch it as quickly as possible. Try to get it in front of your target audience, whoever they are. Don't show it to your friends and family, you know, they will just lie to you and they're probably not going to buy your product anyway. And then you build your features based on real user feedback. So maybe somebody emails you or maybe like analytics. So if you notice that people are dropping off on this page, maybe you need to do something there. If people are not using a certain feature, maybe don't continue working on it. &gt;&gt; All right. Well, let's get into some of the numbers of this. Can you give me a timeline of the growth of bank statement converter? So 2021 we launched bank statement converter. 2022 we hit 6,000 USD MRR. 2023 14,000. 2024 27,000. And today it's at 40,000 USD MR. &gt;&gt; Total number of users 75,000. Paying customers about a,000 and traffic per month about 40,000. &gt;&gt; All right. So everyone watching this right now is probably wondering, okay, it's cool how you built it, but how did you actually market it? How did you get customers? Was there a specific strategy that made this thing go up? &gt;&gt; At first, I bought Google search ads. These were good for getting the initial users, but I was never able to run an ad campaign profitably. So, I would spend maybe $1,000 on ads and bring in about $300 in sales. I spent a lot of time trying to optimize these ads, trying to get them more profitable, but never really worked out. I tried blogging and building in public. That gets quite a lot of attention. However, I don't think I get many users from doing that because my users don't seem to be using Twitter or reading my blog. I also tried sending out cold emails and in 3 months of doing that, I got one sale and I also annoyed a lot of people. I got a lot of angry messages back. People don't really like cold emails. After about 6 months of running Google search ads, I decided, you know, I'm just not going to do this anymore. I might not even do this app anymore. I cut the ads and I thought maybe go back to work. And interestingly, I stopped paying for ads. So, I knew everyone who was clicking on the website was an organic user. And I noticed I started getting new users. I'd get like two or three new signups a day. From that point on, I kind of focused on improving the products. When customers complained about things, I would fix them. and I just basically focused on doing what the customers wanted. &gt;&gt; All right, real quick before we get into how Angus built this $30,000 per month business, let's talk about something that matters a lot once your business starts making money. Banking. The truth is most banks aren't built for solo founders and SAS builders. They slow you down with low card limits, delayed payments, and systems that feel like they were made in 2004. That's why we're partnering with Brex, the modern finance platform that's built from the ground up for startups. With Brex, you can get up to 20x higher card limits. Earn high yields on your cash, automate expenses, invoices, and vendor payments, and move money instantly when you need it. It's fast, flexible, and made to scale with you, no matter how small or scrappy your SAS is right now. We worked with them to put together a free guide called The Startup's Guide to Modern Banking. It breaks down how to protect your cash, extend runway, and upgrade your finance stack without wasting time. Just click the first link in the description to download it. Thank you to Brex for supporting the channel. Let's get back to the video. All right, so you got this website making a bunch of money. It's a great business. You have a team working on this. &gt;&gt; No, it's just me. I started this business with a friend, but he left after a few weeks. I do all the development, customer support, sales, and marketing. &gt;&gt; All right. So, you went from working a 9 toive job to being a soloreneur, running your own business. What was that transition like? working for a company, you kind of spend a lot of time like playing, you know, refactoring code, trying out databases you think are cool. But when you work for yourself, you quickly realize these things don't make any money and potentially are a waste of time. So, your focus is really different. You go from being like a developer who cares about writing nice code to a developer who cares about business features and more business aligned, I suppose. &gt;&gt; Yeah. In your experience becoming a solarreneur, what are some of the pros and cons of the solarreneur lifestyle? &gt;&gt; When I first started, it was a big change. Most of my friends I knew, most of the people I hung out with were people from work. You know, you go out for drinks or whatever. And then I went to working for myself, just being at home all day, basically not socializing. It's kind of a big change when you go from making maybe like $10,000 a month to 200 a month and you're basically hanging out with no one. So being a soloreneur can be pretty depressing. Another thing is people often don't really get what you're doing, especially when you're failing to make money. I remember in the first two years people didn't understand why I did it and they would also, you know, hear the revenue and they would tell me, "Oh, this is like a crappy business. you shouldn't go after this. And then multiple years later when it's making a lot more money, those same people will say like, "Oh, it's a great business." Some pros, it's good to have your own schedule. Often I wake up and go hiking instead of going to work. It's nice to be like on a different schedule to everyone else. If you're starting up a VC back startup, you have a boss, you have investors, you got a lot of time pressure. As a soloreneur, you can go a bit slower. I mean, depending on how much money you have saved up, and you can also go after much smaller markets. A venture capitalist wouldn't want to invest in bank statement converter. It doesn't make enough money. The market's not big enough. But for a single person, you know, it's enough, right? And you can be quite happy with that revenue. &gt;&gt; Cool. Now, you have this great business. You're a solopreneur. What were you doing before? Were you a developer? What was your kind of journey to starting your own business? &gt;&gt; I've always been a developer. In 2010, I worked for an EPS machine company. 2010 to 2014. I worked for myself developing indie games for the Xbox Live indie game store. I also developed a virtual girlfriend app for Android and iOS. It's called Girlfriend Plus. 2017 to 2019, I worked in an investment bank in Hong Kong. 2020 I worked at a crypto company. We're building a crypto exchange. 2021 I launched bank statement converter. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's talk about tech stack. I know you're a developer. Can you share with me the entire stack of how you built this app? The core engine is written in Cotlin. It's like a JVM language. Nex.js is what the front end is written in. I use Brevo for transactional emails. I use AWS EC2 instances to host the back end. Netlefi to host the front end. Stripe for payment processing. And that's about it. a lot of profit. It's like 39 out of $40,000 is profit. Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. So, you built this awesome business. You've been working on it for a number of years. What have you learned in the process that surprised you? &gt;&gt; In the first two years, I was working extremely hard on the business and making basically no money. You know, I spent a lot of hours developing the app. I'd reply to customer emails as soon as possible. If a customer email came in at 3:00 a.m., I would deal with it right away. You know, at that time, every extra customer made a big impact on MR. And what I realized was that those first two years of hard work, you don't get paid much, but you kind of get the money for that hard work in like years four and onwards. The last question that I want to ask is what we ask everyone who comes on to Starter Story. If you could stand on Angus' shoulder when you quit your job, you're building that app. It was making a few dollars in revenue. What advice would you give him? &gt;&gt; SAS is an excellent business model. Make sure you save enough money to survive multiple years of no income. If you only have enough money for a few months of runway, you're probably not going to make it, you know? I mean, it took me two or three years before I could pay rent with the revenue I was getting in. Ignore social media. That's, you know, a lot of people think they need to build a following on social media before building a business. I think it's a waste of time. Building a following on social media is hard work. And even if you have it, your business might still not be very good. So, just focus on the business. Focus on the product. Get some real users. Improve the product. And it should be easy to get more users if your product solves their problem. Don't make a Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter page for your business. See a lot of people do this, and I think it's a waste of time as well. That was awesome. Thank you, Angus, for coming on. I love the business that you built. It's going to keep growing. It's awesome. Thanks for sharing everything with the audience and hope to see you back on soon. Angus is proof that you can build simple apps that actually make money. He found a tiny problem, built a solution for himself, and then turned it into a life-changing business. I think anyone can take this framework and strategy and turn it into their own micro SASS.

TITLE: How I Used Reddit to Hit $17K MRR (With ZERO Audience)
VIDEO ID: BaWUPamqWlA
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaWUPamqWlA
================================================================================

I built a 17K MR SAS with less than 100 followers on X. A few weeks back, I got a cold DM from a guy named Diego. He said, "Hey, I got a story for you." He told me about his successful app and how fast it grew. But when I checked his ex account, he only had 70 followers. I think anyone can build a successful business without an audience. I couldn't find him on YouTube or Tik Tok or Instagram. So, I asked, "Hey, how did you do it?" and what he shared blew me away. I call it the Reddit marketing playbook, and I just had to know more. So, today I brought him onto the channel to break down how you can use Reddit to validate, market, and make money from any idea. All right, let's dive in. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, Diego, welcome to the channel. Tell me about what you built and what's your story. My name is Diego and I built an AI sauce that makes me around 17K per month. I started it 4 months ago and just by using Reddit alone, I've been able to get over 1 million eyes on my product while spending $0 in marketing. All right. Amazing. I'm really excited to talk about the Reddit stuff. But first, let's talk a little bit more about the app that you built. What exactly is the app and what does it do? My app is called App Alchemi and it allows you to build mobile app designs very fast using AI. It's like cursor but for designing mobile apps. Okay, cool. So, we're we're doing stuff in AI. How did you come up with the idea for this? A few months ago, I actually wanted to build my own mobile app and I paid a designer on Upwork for a decent design and it was hundreds of dollars and every time I wanted to make like a little change, I had to pay him extra. I thought that if I could build an AI tool around this, I could save people a lot of time and money. Sick. I love it. So once you had kind of found the idea for this, you started building it. How did you validate that this was something that you wanted to, you know, take all the way and actually launch? So it was a problem I myself had experience. So I knew there was something there. So I built the simplest MVP. I ended up building the MVP in about 2 weeks and I started marketing right away on Reddit. I got my first KMR and even more purely off Reddit. All right, two weeks to build this is insane. Would you have any tips for people watching on how to build apps quickly with AI? Yeah. So, I don't use the newest libraries or frameworks because AI is always going to be a lot better at the libraries that are the most used on the web. And something else that I do is that I use a lot of UI component libraries like Chakra UI or Antesign. And this allows you to prototype a lot faster and to make your website look nicer, too. Okay, before we finish Diego's story, I did want to point something out. Diego builds really fast. He doesn't waste time overthinking. He just goes for it. I talked to a lot of successful founders, and this is one of the most common themes I see. Build fast so you can validate faster. And that's exactly why I want to put Teneb on your radar. Tenweb is an AI powered platform that generates complete readyto-launch websites just from a single prompt. And what's even cooler is Teneb just launched their brand new AI website builder API. With just one API call, it can generate a fully functional hosted WordPress website from just a single text prompt. Tenweb is way more than just a typical template builder. It helps you build a real productionready site fast. With Tenweb, your users get a website that is SEO optimized and mobile friendly, drag and drop editable, fully e-commerce ready with Woo Commerce, and built on WordPress, but completely white labeled under your brand. This tool can literally save months of work. And Tenweb handles everything so you can focus on what makes your product unique. Just click the first link in the description to book a strategy call and see how it works. Thanks to Tenweb for sponsoring the channel. Now, back to Diego's story. Okay, cool. So let's let's go into the numbers a little bit on the business. Uh can you just share some of the numbers behind what you built? Right now there are more than 1K paying customers. I've got it around 20K or more signups on my product purely from Reddit and the traffic per month is about 20K. Okay. So one of the reasons why I wanted to bring you on the channel and what I love about your story is that you did this with basically zero audience. At the time of recording this, you have less than 100 followers on X, no YouTube channel, and just friends and family on your Instagram. But my big question and why I wanted to bring you on the channel is how did you do it? So, a lot of people think that you need a big audience to grow a SAS nowadays. I got my first KMR and even more purely off Reddit. I would say that Reddit is probably the most underrated marketing channels for two different reasons. One, you can get a lot of reach for no cost. The other reason is that compared to all the other platforms, you can get very precise targeting. In Reddit, there is a subreddit or think a community for pretty much everything. So, you can choose a lot of different communities or subreddits that are related to the product you're selling and target the actual users that are interested in what you're building. All right, so we know the power of Reddit. Let's actually dive into the specifics into this whole Reddit marketing playbook. Can you give me your playbook for getting users and making money from Reddit? Absolutely. So, the first step is actually becoming an active Reddit user. If you're not using Reddit already, start using it daily. This has two different purposes. The first one is becoming familiar with the platform and seeing what kind of posts do well. The second one is warming up your account because any posts that come from a newly created account will be automatically filtered out by Reddit. So step two is creating a list of subreddits. And this one is very important because you need volume for this to work. The more the better and you can go broad and narrow. So, there are a lot of different ways to find subreddits related to your product, but the one I recommend the most is using a Reddit ads tool, and you don't need to pay for any ads for this. You just go to the Reddit ads page. You create a new campaign here. When you go to the targeting section, you can look for communities. If I look for, for example, no code, which is related to my own product, I'll get a lot of different communities that are related to this one. and I can keep adding more and I'll keep getting more recommendations. So, the third step is creating a killer organic post. The reason that most people fail on Reddit is that their posts don't feel natural. They feel very pushy and they make it completely around their own product. What you want to do instead is provide a little bit of value in your niche and then you can block or link your product in the middle of the post. The good thing about Reddit is that most successful posts have actually the same structure. Here I have a post of mine that did very well for App Alchemi. And as you can see here, every successful post starts with a catchy attention grabbing headline. What most people do here instead is that they mention their new product or they announce it like they announced the launch. And this is not what you want to do. After the catchy headline, you still don't want to mention the product immediately. You want to provide some value in your niche first. In this specific post, I did a case study on a very successful mobile app. This one, I actually found it on Twitter and I summarized it and then I plugged my product at the end. If you link your product directly, you're going to get a lot more traffic to your website instead of just like mentioning it. Although many subreddits don't allow you to link directly or is prohibited, if you actually provide some value first and you're not just like pushing your product, they will actually be okay with it. For more stricter subreddits that don't allow you to link your product, I would recommend linking an extra product beside yours. Plug like a complimentary product. So for example, for mine is like a design tool. So like cursor complements it very well because it's for development. So I usually plug that one after mine and that way your chances of getting banned or your post being removed for self advertisement is a lot lower. So on the other hand I want to give an example as well of what not to do. So as you can see in this example right here the founder plugs the product right away like mentioning it in the headline. He immediately starts talking about the product, all the features, everything about it. He even like links the Discord. And as you can see from the engagement, this both didn't do very well because people don't care. They want to get some value first. They want to read something interesting and then if your product is related to that, yeah, you can plug it and then they might be interested in it. So step four is grabbing the post we did on the last step and posting it on multiple subreddits and volume here is super important because that increases the chances of one of your posts getting to the Reddit front page and that is going to give you like a lot of traffic. Even if that doesn't end up happening, let's say that you post on 10 different subreddits and each of the posts gets on average let's say around 10k views. That's a total of like 100k views already, which is really good. So, it's still worth it. So, the last step of the playbook is to repeat this process. You should be trying different type of post to see what does better in your niche. You can try videos, you can try case studies, and you can try other type of posts as well. A good rule of thumb is posting two to three times per week. I think that anything more than that will probably get you banned, so you should probably stick to that rule. All right, cool. Well, there you go. That playbook was amazing. Let's switch gears a little bit. Could you just break down your tech stack? How did you build these products? What tools did you use and what's your stack? Yeah, so I use cursor for development and for building. I use Nex.js and React as my main frameworks and I use Firebase for O and for database stuff. And okay, so you're doing about 17K MR. What are the actual costs to run this business? What do the profits look like? So the overall margins are about 70%. cursor is 20 per month. Versel hosting is about 40 per month and then my most expensive costs the AI API backends which are about 2.5K per month. Okay, so you I mean you crushed it in the last 4 months you've found this whole Reddit strategy. You're making money online. What has been the biggest lessons learned in your journey so far? I would say that when it comes to building a SAS, you should be solving a problem in a growing market and a good example I can give is building a SAS tool for newspaper owners for example which like newspapers are in decline or you can build a tool for like vibe coding which only in the last months has been exploding and it's going to keep growing. Something else that I would recommend to everyone is that like in any other business model in SAS, marketing and distribution are actually very important. So even at the start, you should be spending a lot of your time marketing instead of like adding more features no one asked for. And lastly, as a solo founder or small company, speed is one of your major advantages. So take advantage of that whenever possible. Okay, those are awesome. The last question that we ask to everyone who comes on Starter Story, if you could sit on Diego's shoulder before you cracked Reddit, before you were making any money online, what would be your advice? Right now is the best time to build. I would say that if you have an idea, get a simple MVP out there and start marketing it as soon as possible. All right. Well, that's the best advice I heard all month. Thank you, Diego, for coming on the channel. I love the Reddit stuff. That's why I really wanted to have you on this channel. It reminds me of when I first started. So, thank you for coming on. I imagine you're gonna keep growing and we'll have you on when you're doing a million. So, thanks for coming on, man. Thanks for having me. I love Diego's story because it's proof that you do not need an audience to be successful. He did it all just by having a great working product and of course a killer marketing strategy. I really think that anybody can do this, put this into practice and create something that changes their life. But of course, you actually have to build something. If you never build it, you'll never know. And this is why I created Starter Story Build, our flagship program to help you build anything with AI. In less than two weeks, you'll go from just an idea in your head to a fully working app ready to ship to the world. And more importantly, you'll learn the skills to build whatever you want forever.

================================================================================

A few weeks ago, I got a DM on X from this guy named Yasser. We got to chatting and he told me something I couldn't believe. He took his app from 0 to 1 million in just7 days. And what's even crazier is he did it with zero audience. When I launched, I only had 16 followers. I brought Yaser onto the channel to talk about how he did it and he shared everything, including a breakdown of the tweet that changed his life, how to make millions with AI agents, and what most people get wrong when it comes to building their MVP. This one you can't miss. I'm Pat Walls, and this is Starter Story. All right, Yaser, welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. Okay, so my name is Yaser. I built Chadbase to 7 million in ARR with no funding. I launched it 2 and a half years ago as a soloreneur to my 16 followers on Twitter and it went viral. Wow. Okay, that's insane. I haven't seen numbers like that before. Tell me about how you came up with this idea for Chatbase. So I followed the bootstrapping movement on X like Peter Levels, all those guys. I was doing actually internships in fang companies but once I got there I realized maybe it's not for me. I looked at people five 10 years ahead of me in their career and it was not something that I was looking up to but when I saw like people like Peter, people like Danny Pusma especially in the AI wave I thought hey like I can actually do this. I saw people doing demos of how you can build a chat GBT for your data and stuff like that but no one was building a product around it. I knew like this is a good idea. I didn't do any validation or anything. I just like said if I don't do this someone else will. So I released chatbase to my 16 followers. It went viral. All of this was happening in my final year of university, this was just like a side project, right? I was happy it made money, but I'm not going to drop out yet. But when I saw the first sale and then like it kept going and like this is this is significant. I had like two or three sales every day and uh I dropped out. All right. So, you mentioned that you tweeted something out to your 16 followers. It went viral and essentially that this this one tweet kind of changed your life. Can you walk me through this viral tweet? I think this was like my third tweet ever in my life. For this one, three things made it work well. One, a familiar interface, the streaming interface where like the text is streaming uh in a in like a chat interface. Yeah, this was like a very chat GPT thing which like at the time was going viral. So, I think taking a glance at the demo, it's just just interesting. The other part was minimizing the seconds to like the aha moment. I think I did that well here. Like it's a very simple demo, right? But it just shows you exactly what I built was capable of in like the first 20 seconds, right? And I think the other thing I did is mention the tools that I was using 2 and a half years ago. Like there was a bunch of new AI companies, AI tools starting out. No one had any customers because they're all new. So every company was trying to show people like, hey, this is something that is being used by real people building like real products. When I mentioned like Langchin and Pine Cone and stuff like that, it made sense for them to push it too because no one else was building stuff like this on their platforms yet because it was all very new and they they wanted to promote like their AI features and stuff like that. When I mentioned this, those people picked it up and they were like going viral. So my thing also went viral and then it created this viral loop and I think yeah most of most of the initial traction was from that. I really do like the kind of build in public thing that you're doing. You're kind of sharing what tools you were using and that was a big piece in it. if you could break down the build in public playbook because I know you kind of did this over and over again. Tell me what you learned and and what works there. Yeah, so I think the easiest thing is just to share what you're doing every day. That's like the most basic thing you can do. First two or 3 months if you're if you're not lucky, it will just be you practicing what works and what doesn't. It's it's not going to get any any views because you're you're trying to build a brand, you're trying to build a story, one tweet is not going to do it, right? People need to see your face a lot. Preferably, if you can do videos, too, post them on X. a few people in the build and public space are doing that and they're doing very well because not enough people are doing that so you stand out more. Frame it as like I'm building something. I'm learning a lot along the way. I'm going to take you on that journey. I would say also an important part is not to be boring. I think it's better to be more personal. Share like your personal story. Have a personality like have controversial takes maybe if if it's something you actually believe in because that's how you get people to notice you. All right. Before we get further into how Yasser built this business to over 6 million ARR, I want to call out something a lot of early founders forget about your bank. Yeah, I know not the sexiest part of your stack, but when your app goes viral, revenue jumps, and your user base explodes overnight. The wrong bank can become a massive bottleneck. Low card limits, slow payouts, manual everything. That's what happens when you use a finance system that wasn't built for startups. That's why we've partnered with Brex, the modern finance platform designed for builders like you. With Brex, you get up to 20x higher card limits, built-in expense tracking, automated payments, high yield returns, and sameday liquidity, so you can move fast when the moment hits. One in three US startups already use Brex, and they put together this free guide for you, the startup's guide to modern banking. It breaks down how to extend your runway, protect your cash, and avoid the kind of finance headaches that kill momentum. Just click the first link in the description to grab the guide. Thank you to Brex for supporting the channel. Now, let's get back to Yaser's story. Before we jumped on this call, you told me something crazy, which was that Chatbase went from zero to a million ARR in 117 days, which is less than half a year, just a couple months. That doesn't even seem believable to me. So, I'd love if you broke down how that's even possible, that an app can grow that fast and and how yours did. After the first initial viral moment, I kept adding more features and with every new release, I would frame it as a new launch. I think some people when they tweet, they frame like the second or third launch as like feature launches. So, if someone new is looking at that, they don't have any context, right? So, they're not they're very likely to skip it. So I try to frame every single launch to make it make sense to new people that don't know me, that don't know Chadbas. The other thing was just like being creative around going viral without spending any money. So what I did for example going into subreddits of books, I would create a chat GPT for their book. It was like for free. I was losing money on this. The only point of doing this is to have my domain opened by a lot of people so I get like more domain authority. Maybe they click on it and then they see the landing page. they see, hey, like I can actually pay money for this. I kept doing that for all the books. I did that for a lot of influencers, too. I did this for Paul Bram, for Naval. Lastly, also sponsored posts were very big. If I'm not launching something today, then I have to do a sponsored post with a big page. We did one with a page on LinkedIn that day. I think we did $4,000. So, so yeah, I think sponsored posts, if you structure them well, they're a very good way to get your product out there. Awesome. All right. Well, can we dive into some of the numbers behind this business? How big is this thing become? Yeah, right now we're exactly at 6.8 million ARR. It's growing very fast. And right now it's only PLG. We just passed actually 2 days ago 10,000 customers that are paying us between $40 and $500 a month, which is insane. And I think registered users is around like 600,000 something. Okay, that's insane. You mentioned PLG. What is that? So this is productled growth. You just have a Stripe button on your website. You do most of the marketing outside of your website. You just have a good landing page. People can just go in, buy a subscription, put in their credit card. You don't have to have a lot of features. Just have like one core feature. In my case, it would just upload a PDF and talk with it. Just have like a good UI. Don't have any bugs. Have like a good MVP and then launch it into the universe. Find the balance between launching fast and not launching garbage. have a good quality tool so that you're proud of when people are using it and then people would be excited to use it more if they're not like frustrated using it. All right. Well, let's talk about AI agents. That's what you've been building for a long time. You know a lot about this. How can people watching this learn how to build with AI agents? What's the right kind of framework for learning these and where to go? If you want to build products, then you go to sources like OpenAI's cookbooks or like their documentation. Read about their agents SDK. do the same with Verscell has a library called the AI SDK which is very powerful. Uh just read like their documentation, look at the examples, look who's using them. Learn how those companies tell you how to build AI agents. I think actually maybe a good idea is to find something that you can't build yet and the only bottleneck is the AI model itself. like the intelligence is not there yet and then start building that and just like bet that in a year you're going to have GPT5 which is capable of doing that and then you're going to have one full year like a head start on everyone else. I think something very similar happened to me. I started working on chatbase before that chat GPT API. So I had like the product ready. I was people were using it and then all of a sudden chat GPT launched their chat API. So I just released a tweet that said in the last 48 hours I I built like this cool new product and because everyone was talking about the new chat GPT API and how what you can build with it. This also went very viral. So yeah, I think I think you can do something similar. All right, let's talk about tech stack. Uh how did you build this app? What kind of tools and languages and stack did you use to build this? Yeah, so it changed over time. Now I think the stack we landed on is Versel for hosting. We're also using their AI SDK for a lot of our AI infrastructure. We're using superbase for the database. And then we're using all the AI labs. So, OpenAI, Anthropic, Anthropic, Coher, Google Gemini, Gro, we're using all of them. So, in chatbas, you can have a drop down and choose which model works best for you. And of course, Stripe for billing, Dub for affiliates, Mentlify for our documentation. Cool. You have built this amazing business. You've been doing it for many years. You've had some successful things, some not so successful projects. What have you learned through the process that surprised you? Yeah. So, I think going into it where we assume that there's like a blueprint on how to build a good business. It's just who's going to be working hard. But what I realized is that there's so many different ways to build a good company from like how you work together, performance reviews, in person or remote, what's the culture like, all of that can change a lot between company to company. This is actually good because this means that you don't need a lot of experience to start a company. Mostly the advice you're getting from people that have done this before. It's it's just good to listen to but mostly irrelevant because no one knows your situation as much as you. The best practices change so much from situation to situation. The people that give good advice will tell you the same thing. They would give you what they think is right, but in the end they will say actually like you should like trust your gut mostly because you know your situation more than me. Cool. I love that. Last question that we ask everyone who comes on Starter Story, if you could go back 2 and 1/2 years or however long it's been, stand on Yaser's shoulder, what would be your advice to young Yaser? Yeah, I think for me specifically, I wasn't thinking big enough in the beginning. My goal was to just get my 10K, move to Bali, live the indie hacker lifestyle. I just realized like why not shoot for the stars, right? Why not build the first 100 million ARR bootstrap company. I was too worried that because everyone was saying it's like a chat GPT rapper. It's not going to work. This this got into my head because it was true. It was just a chat GPT rapper. So, I think I wasn't aggressive enough. I was too shy about what I'm building. I was too reserved. I think if I go back, I would have moved a lot faster. I would have put more on the line. So, yeah, just aim higher, I would say, for me. Cool. Well, that's great advice. Thank you, Yaser, for coming on to Starter Story. It's amazing what you built. One of the probably greatest success stories in the India hacker world. and it's going to keep growing and I love it. So, thanks for coming on. Thank you for having me. Yaser is proof that you don't need a big audience to get started. He started his app when he had 16 followers on Twitter and in less than 3 years he grew it to over 6 million ARR. He got started just by building stuff. And nowadays, AI has made it easier than ever to build. That's why I launched Starter Story Build. It's our flagship program where in 2 weeks you'll find and build a simple app with AI. Hundreds of people have joined and launched their first app into the world. Head to the link in the description to learn more. Thank you guys for watching. I'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: How I Built It: $15K/month Mobile App
VIDEO ID: gpn1jEoWT4A
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpn1jEoWT4A
================================================================================

I turned a simple habit tracker into a 15K MR business. Sebastian Ro always wanted to build his own apps. So he decided to quit his job and give himself 12 months to figure it out. No plan, no idea, just a dream to build. I quit my job with no idea, just 12 months of runway. But 6 months in, he had less than a dozen downloads on his app and he was faced with a decision. He changed up his strategy and then found an idea that changed everything. And then in under two years, he went from just building side projects that made him a few hundred bucks to a full-time solo developer making $15,000 a month on the app store. The secret to reaching top 10 in the app stores is In this video, I bring Sebastian onto the channel to break down what happened after he quit his job and it's not what you'd expect. We'll also go over his failed ideas and why they didn't work. And he'll share the secret to why his app has been downloaded over 300,000 times. This is the playbook to building successful apps. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. Welcome Sebastian to Starter Story. Thanks for coming on. So tell me, what's your story? Hi, thank you for having me. My name is Sebastian. I am 32 years old. I'm living in Germany and yeah, I'm the creator of Habit Kit. It's a visually appealing and very simple habit tracking mobile app that helps users build and maintain their daily habits. I launched Habit Kit in 2022 after I quit my corporate programming job to uh finally become a full-time indie app developer. Since then, my app has grown significantly, reaching $15,000 in monthly recurring revenue through a combination of building in public and effective app store optimization. Beautiful. Okay. Well, let's dive a little bit more into this business and some of the numbers behind it. I have roughly 300,000 downloads on the App Store and Google Play combined and over 2,000 reviews and ratings. I'm ranking for various important keywords in the habit tracking space. The most important one is habit tracker in the top five in multiple countries for that. I love that. Let's go right into uh development of the app. I know that you have a software development background. Tell me about how you built this app. Uh yeah, sure. I had the idea for habit kits uh in summer of 2022. I immediately started building the app and I used flatter for this. That's a crossplatform framework that allows you to deploy your apps to iOS and Android with a single codebase. When I started, I focused on the core functionality. It was a tilebased grid chart for the users habits with a clean and super simple interface. And the MVP features just included the basic habit tracking and the visualization of the progress. And I built it with privacy in mind. All data is stored locally on the device. There's no sign in required, no authentication. The users have complete control over their data. I also decided to share the development progress on my social media. And after posting the first screenshots and seeing a positive reception, I knew that I should really hurry up and bring the app to the app store and uh make it quick. I kept it really simple and clean and just banged it out in 2 months. So, let's take a step back and I want to learn a little bit more about your past, your background. What were you doing before this and how did that lead to coming up with the idea for Habit Kit? Yeah. So, um, my background is pretty straightforward. After school, I studied computer science at a university here in Germany for roughly 6 years and did my master's thesis and after that I started a regular programming job at a middlesized company here in Germany as well. I learned a lot there. But uh after 3 years of being stuck in the same project there, I became a little bit restless and wanted to be a little bit creative and work on my own projects. So after 3 years of the same project at my regular job, I decided it was time to quit my job and focus on indie development for at least 12 months. The first 6 months were really challenging. um I didn't had a lot of revenue so I kept in touch with the people at my old job and after the my my 12 month deadline was over I decided to go back to my old job and continue doing my app business on the side. I felt like a failure and like a success because I had at least some revenue. It wasn't really high, but I think it's already a huge success if you have a side business with $1,000 revenue. At the end of 2023, I finally reached $3,000 in monthly recurring revenue. At the end of 2024, I achieved over $15,000 in MR. I quit my job the second time uh at the start of 2024 and I'm finally able to to have complete control over my time and work on whatever I want. All right, before we dive into how Sebastian built his app to over 300,000 downloads, let's talk about something that trips up way too many founders. Not setting up your business in the right way. You spend months building, marketing, growing, but if you're not legally protected or even registered properly, one mistake can wreck everything. That's why we're excited to partner with Zen Business. Zen Business empowers entrepreneurs from all walks of life to confidently start, protect, and grow their business.

So, if you're serious about what you're building, this is the first step. Click the first link in the description to launch your LLC today at $0 plus state fees and get started today. Thanks to Zen Business for sponsoring. Now, let's get back to Sebastian's story. I want to get a little bit more tactical. How did you actually grow this business and what marketing channels did you use for Habitat? In the beginning, building in public was huge for me. I shared my journey and development process across multiple platforms like X, LinkedIn, Blue Sky, and Threads. I tried to create authentic content, share about my wins, failures, successes and so on that led to unexpected opportunities, being guest on podcasts, being featured on videos or having good connections to other app developers. So that was a huge uh part of my success in the beginning. Another important aspect are search ads. Um I just I won a super simple and lowbudget Apple search ads campaign. Um, I only spent $100 per month on it. I just used this as a potential ranking boost strategy because I have the hope that Apple favors developers who also run ads on their platform. And after that, uh, the biggest thing probably was app store optimization. App Store optimization is basically editing your app store meta data like keywords, app name, or subtitle or even the screenshots in the way that you're more likely to rank in the top spots when people search for certain keywords. I'm focusing on the habit tracker keyword and that's why I put it right at the start of my app name. Another important aspect of ASO is um gathering user reviews for your app. I um instantly show the native review dialogue. So it says, "Do you like habit kits? Please review it on the app store or something like that right after the first habit uh was checked off for a user." So that that's their first success moment. and I asked them right at this situation and most people just gave it five stars and you gain a lot of reviews and ratings. Yeah. So, gathering uh reviews is pretty important. Beautiful. Let's talk about ideas. You've launched a few things on the app store. Some of them were flops, some of them are hugely successful. Tell me about your process for finding ideas and validating them. In terms of finding good ideas, my recommendation is to just start building anything. It doesn't matter what exactly. Once you get into the groove and start building something, you will naturally get a ton of other great cool ideas for later projects. In terms of validation, I just build apps that solve my own problems. Um, I will always be my first customer and so I always know exactly what's needed in the product, what are the requirements and what works and what not. Cool. I love that. So, you have an app, it makes $15,000 a month. walk me through the different technologies and stack that you use to actually build this app. As in terms of development tools, I use Flutter. That's a crossplatform framework for for building mobile apps uh for iOS and Android with a single codebase. I use uh cursor as my AI powered IDE. Um, I love the autocomp completions that the AI provides and I love to chat about different problems with it. To do my keyword research and ASO optimizations, I used a tool called Astro. It yeah, it allows you to search for keywords on the app store and see their popularity and difficulty. For app analytics and marketing and also a little bit of keyword research, I use app figures. And in terms of uh handling subscriptions and purchases in my apps, I use a service called Revenue Cat. Yeah. And for personal habit tracking, I use Habit Kit, of course. I also use some other tools like Waycast, which is a collection of productivity tools for your Mac and Chat with AI, one password. These are some very important tools in my tool chain. Okay, cool. On a similar note, let's talk about costs. Uh I know you're a solarreneur. You're running this yourself. You built everything out. You don't have any employees. How much does it actually cost in total to run an app like this? Yeah. So, um my expenses are super low. Um my biggest expense is revenue kit right now because uh they take um 1% of my revenue. So, depending on the month of the year, that can be a lot, but it's totally worth it. And yeah, the rest can be added up to roughly $200 or $300 per month. So it's really low. Nice. Wow. Okay, cool. So your app makes $15,000 a month. You've kind of gone through the process of building something successful. What is something that you learned in the process that you didn't expect? Yeah, I was super surprised um that I was able to to compete in the App Store and Google Play with bigger companies or people that are super long on the app store. I reached top five in super important keywords uh which drives a ton of organic traffic to my apps. And yeah, if you manage to secure a good ranking on the app store, you don't need a big marketing budget and you can compete with with bigger brands. Nice. Cool. Well, the last question that we ask all founders that come on Starter Story, if you could go back in time and give advice to Sebastian right when he quit his job, what advice would you give? I would say save money for Sabbatical to focus on development of your app business like I did. I saved some money and I just quit my job and set myself a deadline for 12 months to do something that works. Yeah. because I couldn't find motivation to code on my own apps after I programmed for 8 hours on my regular job. So quitting my job was actually the only chance to to get this started. And yeah, this ultimately helped me to focus on my stuff and lay the important foundation and ultimately for my dream business. Yeah, I love that. You know, a lot of people think what's going to happen if I quit my job. Uh, but at the end of the day, you can just go back and get another job. And that's exactly what happened to you. And I just love this story. Thank you for coming on, Sebastian, and sharing everything about your business, going deep, sharing a bunch of things that you didn't have to. You're awesome. Thanks for coming on, Starter Story. Thank you for having me. All right. I love Sebastian's story. It shows you the power of building on platforms. We talked all about ASO, which I think is super cool. So, hopefully that was helpful. If you want to build something similar to Sebastian, check out Starter Story Build. is our platform for building a real app going from an idea to a launched app in 12 days. I'll put that link in the description. Thank you guys for watching. I'll leave you with one question. What's your story? Peace.

TITLE: I Make $100K/Year From 2 AI Side Projects
VIDEO ID: CoqAxV6b6j4
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoqAxV6b6j4
================================================================================

I make 100k a year from my side projects while keeping my full-time job. Meet Romsri, an app builder from India who runs two profitable AI side projects while keeping a full-time job. I only work on my apps 1 to 2 hours a week. In this video, Romrey breaks down how he manages all of this and why he has no plans to quit his full-time job. The reason I haven't quit my full-time job is I brought Romy onto the channel to share how he got millions of users while spending zero dollars on marketing, his framework for finding profitable side project ideas, and the secret to building any successful project in AI. Building with AI is simple because if you're building apps on the side, this episode is a mustwatch. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. [Music] All right, Ramsree, welcome to the channel. Thank you for coming on. Tell me a little bit about who you are, what you built, and what's your story. My name is Rams, and I build two apps that make me $8,500 per month. I'm currently building these two apps alongside my full-time job. Right now, I'm spending about 2 hours a week on these apps, and they mostly run on complete autopilot. Great. All right. Tell me about some of the numbers behind these businesses. Superme has done lifetime revenue of about 130k USD and question is around 100k USD. Both of them combined are at $8,500. So approximately a little over 100k arr. Coming to the users 1.5 million plus users for super meme and about 150k plus users for question. Paying customers 400 for super meme and 18 to 200 for question. What I love about this is that you're building this on the side. You've decided to keep your full-time job. Tell me about what that's like to build profitable projects while you have a full-time job. The key during the initial phases of development of these two projects was to assign one two hours of daily learning and development. SAS has quite a lot of components not just about building the tech aspect of it but rather there's whole suite of things payments authentication databases marketing SEO. So it took me a few years to gain proficiency in all these aspects. Consistency is the only thing that helped. You know nowadays with tools like deep research and AI assisted coding tools like wind surf, cursor, it has become a lot more easier to build as well as maintain these apps alongside whatever you're doing full-time. Nowadays I mostly treat my SAS apps like they are in autopilot mode. just allocate Saturday afternoon, couple of hours to do updates or quick bug fixes. Cool. I'm curious, you know, you have these businesses that are doing pretty good. Why haven't you decided to go full-time, you know, buy back all your time and why did you decide to kind of keep your full-time job? One thing is that I don't want to take on VC funding or take on the responsibility of hiring and maintaining a team for the sake of growth and several other aspects of life. For example, I have a kid, retired parents. So, I don't want people around me to go through the same roller coaster ride of emotions and being always busy and unavailable lifestyle. I don't want them to experience that. Let's take a step back and talk a little bit about your background. I know you've done a bunch of different things. Walk me through your background and how you got into building apps. I was full on on the MOO revolution doing every technical course on Corsera, Udacity and all these platforms during 2015 to 2018 phase. And when I started doing these, I started getting a lot of ideas in the AI space and I thought it's about time for me to experiment. So 2018 to 2020, I just got my feet wet into entrepreneurship. I did not have any entrepreneurship background. So I was just testing the waters. So I started writing all about my experiments on LinkedIn and Twitter. Eventually people started following me and asking questions and waking up every day and writing online on these platforms became my point of comfort. And during 2021 and 2022 is when I took all my learnings and launched a Udemy course and that made like $10,000 in revenue till now. That was a good turning point for my let's say slowcooked entrepreneurship journey in 2022 2023. I learned no code tools and created the first version of question.ai. No beautiful UI just two text boxes left and right. Then I realized the bottlenecks that I'm hitting and thought of just learning full stack with the latest and greatest tech. spent 6 months and fully ported question to modern tech stack for super meme since I knew the pain of growing a solo startup I wanted to take a different route so I partnered with the fullstack developer I'm the AI guy and there's another marketer that worked out well about a year year and a half before I took up a full-time job as well and I'm quite happy that it all worked out before we finish talking about how Ramshree built his two projects I do want to highlight something important You don't need a massive budget to build a good business, but you do need to know what people are searching for. That's why we're excited to partner with Semrush. Semrush is an all-in-one marketing platform trusted by over 10 million users, from indie makers to global brands. It helps you understand exactly what your audience wants so you can build something smarter and market better. Here's how to use it in three quick steps.

You can use it to validate new ideas, create content that ranks, and even find paid keywords your competitors are sleeping on. So, if you're serious about building products that people actually want, start with Seamrush. Just click the first link in the description to grab your free trial. All right, let's get back to the video. Let's talk about ideas. You have two successful ideas. I imagine you've had some that haven't worked out. How did you find these ideas? And generally, how do you think about finding ideas that are worth building? In short, to fit it in a framework, get manual tasks that people currently pay for, which could be significantly enhanced or substituted by existing or imminent generative AI. That's where the key is. So, let's take for example question.ai back in 2020. The first thing that we identified was large tech companies and publishing companies do a lot of quiz creation. We saw that there's potential here. But AI wasn't there yet to deliver automated quiz creation from text, but we could foresee that this quiz generation with AI could grow significantly in the next few years. So that was our insight. You should always keep a tab on where generative AI is headed so that you can identify new business use cases that the new AI technology can unlock which was previously not possible or complex or costly. That's cool. Okay. Well, let's talk about growth because you know a lot of these AI apps are getting built now. Anybody can build anything now. But the next piece is getting attention, getting distribution. You have over a million people using one of your apps. Tell me about how you've approached growth and how you got your first users and grew the business. Build distribution before building a product. By distribution, I mean write about stuff that interests you or what you're working on. For example, for question, before even building the product, I used to write a lot of blogs about quiz generation, create some videos on YouTube, things like that. Every single day, I used to show up on LinkedIn, write about stuff that I'm working on. Both question.ai AI and superme.ai. Even before hitting any virality, we completely built them in public. Sometimes I used to get 10 likes, sometimes 100 likes, 400 likes. So the algorithm keeps changing all the time. But consistency matters a lot. That's how I found even co-founders for my app. They saw my posts and we just got together. So I would say the biggest thing was social media founder content sharing. That's how we got all of our first users. Iterated on initial MVPs that we built. After that we launched on product hunt and luckily with the initial set of users who were our champions through our social media. They helped us and also the virality factor of AI meme generator got us to number one on product hunt on the launch day for super meme. Cool. I like that. Let's get a little bit more technical. Well, I want to hear about how you build stuff cuz you're doing this on the side and you must know a lot of different cool tech and how you built this business. So, walk me through your tech stack and the tools and languages you've learned and you've used to build out this business. It's Nex.js for primary app development. So, full stack framework that's based on JavaScript. For backend primarily superbase for landing pages etc. We have been using typedream just to build no code landing pages and do quick rapid SEO changes. And there's quite a lot of heavy development with AI assisted coding tools like wind surf cursor. This is our current tech stack. And on that same note, walk me through some of the costs and margins. How much does it cost to run this business? What do the margins look like? I would say we operate at a 70 to 75% profit margin. The biggest cost is mostly APIs. Whether it is AI, APIs from OpenAI, Anthropic. The other thing is that we have no employees aside the founders. That helps us keep the costs minimal. Cool. I like that. Let's go over to a little bit more of a personal note. You're running two successful side projects. You got a full-time job. You got a family. What does a typical day in the life look like for someone like you? So, my typical day starts at like 7:30 a.m. where I wake up, get my kid dressed up, and I drop him to school. By 9:30, I'm usually free. I have a treadmill at home, so I do some walking and then catching up on some AI news. 12:30 I pick up my kid and we have some home-cooked lunch. That's till like 2:00 p.m. Between 2 to 5:30 p.m. is where I do bulk of my full-time job work. After that, I have my dinner with family. And if there are any urgent pending tasks, I allocate an hour from like 9:30 to 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. to do work related stuff. Otherwise, I just watch some TV or documentaries and go to bed by 11:30 or latest by 12:00. Usually, I don't pick up my SAS related stuff daily. I just dedicate Saturday afternoon, usually 2 to 5:00 p.m., 2 to 4 p.m. That's when I have like one or two hours to do some feature updates or just do some housekeeping tasks for the SAS apps. That's cool. The last question that we ask, if you could sit on Romster's shoulder when he was just starting out trying to find that first app idea, what advice would you give him? Think like a builder from day one. And in today's age, it is very much possible to adapt that mindset and build something quick. For example, even if you want to do wipe coding, there are tools like lovable bold new. Even if you want to just purely use chained workflow app then there are automations that you can create with tools like make or n or zap year etc. Right? So whenever you have an issue or you come across an idea that can be built build a minimum viable prototype of it using these tools. The other thing is to follow tech updates very closely because you could identify new use cases that can be built on top of them. But the biggest thing is to aim for solving a problem by chaining and stitching together tools and products that are out there than spending months in R&amp;D. That's very crucial. All right. Thank you, Romy, for coming on to Starter Story. I love what you build. Keep building more stuff and I hope to have you back on in the future. Thank you so much, Pat, and it's my pleasure to be absolutely here. Thanks, Romstre, for coming on the channel. I personally love his approach to building lots of different side projects, not taking the huge leap of quitting your full-time job and having a good lifestyle businesses and still tinkering and having fun and building stuff. I personally love that. If you're wanting to build something similar, specifically AI side projects, then check out Starter Story Build. I put a link in the description, but basically in 12 days, you'll come up with an idea, build it, launch it, and have a real life production app by the end. This is for anyone actually serious about building stuff and potentially creating an app that could change your life. I'll put the link in the description if you want to check it out, but otherwise, I'll see you guys in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: I Built a $1M SaaS 100% with No Code (Bubble)
VIDEO ID: x9TUDb4sLE0
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9TUDb4sLE0
================================================================================

After six failed SAS ideas, my seventh made millions. This is Jacob. He built a million-dollar SAS 100% with no code. So, you don't need to know how to actually code. You don't need to know code syntax. The tool he built it with and grew it from 0 to $1 million ARR. It's not lovable. It's not cursor. It's that's the best part of it is anyone can get started and understand the basic frameworks even of programming. Jacob is proof that you don't need any coding experience to build a profitable SAS. And not knowing how to code might actually be a huge advantage. In this video, Jacob and Alex come on to the channel to break down exactly how they bootstrapped their SAS to $1 million in just 10 months. Plus, we'll talk about the secret to building MVPs with no code, the marketing strategy that exploded the business, and how you can get started building apps without code. Today I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. All right, welcome Jacob to Starter Story. Tell me a little about the business that you built and what's your story. My name is Jacob and I built a million-dollar business with no code. I'm a self-taught developer and the co-founder of Faceless Video. It's 100% bootstrapped and I built it from scratch with Bubble and it's now doing over a million dollars a year in ARR. Wow, that's amazing. Uh, can you give me a further breakdown of how Faceless works, what it does, and some of the numbers behind the business? It's a SAS that automates Faceless social media channels and the user only needs to provide their channel topic. And our platform writes the video content, creates the video, and posts that video on the user's behalf every single day, entirely on autopilot. We're generating thousands of videos every single day for users. Some of which had well over a million views, plenty of which have had hundreds of thousands of views. Total number of users signed up, over 1.1 million. and they're all hopping on current and relevant trends right now. That's an amazing business that you built. But I want to go back a little bit. Uh what's your background and how do you get to the point of building a SAS? My background started as an artist. I uh started as a songwriter, producer, and I was releasing music on Spotify, diving full force into that world. So when I graduated college, I decided to live at home with my mom and go full force into being a songwriter, artist, producer. I started hiring companies to do marketing for me, but I I was just repeatedly disappointed by all the different marketing services that I was getting. So, I just figured, okay, I got to go do this myself. So, I took courses online about how to market my music and with very little budget took my music to close to a million streams and thousands of genuine fans. That naturally progressed into helping my friends out in the music business and helping them promote their music, which turned into my first business, Domino. It's a music marketing agency. And while I love that experience, what I realized about doing a service-based business is that my income was directly correlated with my time. And I just wanted to scale beyond my agency and help more people without sacrificing more of my time. And that made me start looking into SAS. So, you caught the bug and then you came upon an idea that kind of changed everything. Let's talk about that idea and I actually had you bring your co-founder, Alex, on who was a part of coming up with that idea. So, Alex is joining us right now. I'd love to hear from you. Uh, how did you come up with the idea for Faceless Video? Yeah, so thanks for having me. I was getting a lot of Faceless videos on my Tik Tok algorithm. I had seen a lot of these videos go extremely viral, and my goal originally was just to go viral. And I thought to myself, I can edit these videos. You know, they look simple enough. They're going viral. Why not do it myself? But then I realized that consistency was a huge problem. and coming up with new ideas, editing every day became something that was actually pretty difficult to stick to. So, I had an idea because I realized with, you know, the advancements in tech that were going on, these videos were simple enough that this could be done automatically. And so, I reached out to Jacob and then Jacob had the idea to make this into a SAS product instead of an internal tool so we could make channels together. Looking back, I'm really glad that I let the algorithm guide me. And you know, we all are on Tik Tok and Instagram reels and we see these trends in videos and most of the time we scroll past. But if you take a second to actually analyze what's going on, there are plenty of good business ideas in there. So you have the idea, now it's time to get building. Tell me how how did you build Faceless Video? It started with Bubble and APIs. And Bubble was the infrastructure for bringing everything together. And like with anything else, it always starts with can this work from a technical perspective at least. You know, can I actually find a way to type in text and have this web app output a faceless video. So for the first month, that's really all this MVP was. And that eventually migrated into managing users, having a UIUX flow, a payment processing system, a pricing model, and turning it into a full-fledged web app. Okay. So tell me why Bubble is great for non-developers. In its simplest form, it translates programming into human language. So you don't need to know how to actually code. You don't need to know code syntax is plain English. And that's the best part of it is anyone can get started and understand the basic frameworks even of programming. Because now that I actually know how to code, I see that it is actually still very much programming just in a more visual human friendly way. And they also handle plenty of other important aspects of actually running a web app such as security, scalability, privacy rules, backend management, all these other things that I would not have even known where to begin if I was just coming at it completely fresh or custom. You know, I talked to a lot of people who will start their app on Bubble, but then, you know, once things get too complicated and they really want to scale, they have to move off it, which ends up being a huge thing. But as I understand, you your app, which is making a million dollars a year right now, is still on Bubble. Why have you decided to stay on Bubble? If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It's kind of as simple as that. You know, we haven't run into any issues that would require a dramatic shift. I I ran into a scalability issue once, but Bubble support fixed it, and that was really good piece of mind for staying longterm with them. And realistically, all the bells and whistles that developers get through custom code is not necessary for building a successful business. All you need is a great idea, a functioning product, and a great go to market strategy, and you can validate really quickly and scale based on that. All right, let's pause for a quick moment to talk about AI. Everyone's hyped up right now about using AI to build apps. But right now, I'm seeing that most people get stuck in what I call a death spiral of prompting. They have lots of chats with the AI, but the code never actually works. And that's exactly why we're partnering with Bubble. Bubble AI doesn't put your idea into a cookie cutter template. It actually blows it up into a full stack working app. All you have to do is describe your idea and Bubble AI will spin up the entire stack in minutes. A polished UI, a pre-wired database, and workflows that are ready to roll. I've been poking around with it to build some stuff for Starter Story. And watching it just build everything while I sit there and enjoy my drink is pretty amazing. So, if you've been sitting on an idea, head to the first link in the description, sign up for free, and tell Bubble AI exactly what you want to build. If you do that, drop your idea in the comments. I'll read through them and let you know which ones are my favorite. All right, let's dive back into Jacob and Alex story. On that note, um, what would be some of the opportunities that you see right now for ideas that people could build with Bubble or other no code tools? I think marketplaces are kind of the first thing that comes to mind actually. Just because it's the easiest way to manage a front end and a backend through no code. It's a little bit more generic, but honestly, you can build anything if you get creative. But even if it's no code, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's easy. Uh you still have to get creative. You still need to be resourceful, but there's plenty of opportunities with no code. And it brings down the barrier to entry enough so that you can start. And starting is the biggest hurdle. Well, that's awesome. So, I want to switch gears to marketing distribution. How did you take this idea from zero to a million dollars a year? To have success as a B2C app, you need to have viral potential. Your CAC, customer acquisition costs, it's pretty low. And so, to spend a lot on ads or other methods of promotion is not really viable for a a B2C app. That's something I learned with Faces that my other products really didn't have. We didn't reinvent the wheel. We do all of the usual stuff, you know, we do SEO, we do ads, influencers, organic content, but the key is really getting your messaging right and it's nothing fancy. It's just good execution. So, I come from a film making background and that's a lot about storytelling. So, if you can crack storytelling, then you can really sell a product. What you want to do is kickstart telling that story with ads, influencer collaborations, and other things. That's what Jacob and I did. Our first advertisement for Faceless Video was a Twitter thread that we spent I don't know like 200 bucks on and we got hundreds of thousands of views and kind of instantly went viral. Um, and that was very very helpful for us. And also our biggest growth came when influencers who saw our ads that we'd never even reached out to started promoting Faceless.video on their own because they genuinely believe that their audience would like the product. And Jacob also knows this, but word of mouth is consistently one of our top five attribution sources. So like on our customer attribution thing, people will just type in friend. So you know, people actually like the product. But if you have something that's truly original and solves a pain point, especially around an emerging trend, people will notice if you're first to market with something. So that's what we kind of centered our whole marketing strategy around is showing how are we different from what's out there? And then also this is how you can tap into this existing trend in a new way. So you can lay the foundation with traditional marketing like ads, influencers and all these things. But virality happens when the product kind of speaks for itself and you have the proper messaging and all of the incentives are lined up. I want to switch gears a little bit and talk about uh this business that you built and how it's impacted you. Uh you had a lot of failed businesses before, then you had this thing kind of take off. I'd love to hear more about that experience and how it changed things. SAS is incredible. I think that's kind of the first thing I I have to say. I went from a servicebased business into into SAS and it just allows you to make more money while getting your time back. And that that's huge. With a properly running system, your business will make money for you while you sleep. That doesn't mean it's hands off though while you're awake, of course, but I I was just amazed by how the system can really work when it connects. Something else that I realized a little bit maybe more on the personal side is it's important to make sure that what you're pursuing is for the love of doing it because when times get hard it it's easy to quit. It also gives us a competitive advantage because Jacob and I truly love doing this business and we're obsessed with it. We're always thinking about it. We're always texting each other about the business and if it's not truly something you love, someone who loves doing it, they'll always surpass you. You have this successful business. You get to sit down and work on it every day. You're passionate about it. What does an actual day in the life look like for you? You have a million- dollar business. What does that look like? Every day it kind of sits into two different buckets. I'm either looking into ways to cut costs, make things more efficient, improve the product, or bring on completely new features, integrations, and partnerships. That's kind of what a day in the life looks like is just constant optimizations. I'm still doing bug reports, too. So, there's of course the mundane side of things as well. For me, it's more of a balancing act. It's just finding new ways to grow while keeping our existing channels running smoothly. So, you know, creative strategy, working with our new team, as Jacob said, managing partnerships. So, it's just figuring out how to scale while also not breaking what's already working. Thanks for sharing that. Last question we ask all founders is if you can stand on Jacob and Alex's shoulders when you're just starting out before the success, what would you tell them? There's there's three things that come to mind for me. The the first is build from day zero optimizing for the best case scenario. If a 100,000 people signed up today, could your app handle it? Or would you have to rethink your pricing model and your technical debt when that starts to happen? The other thing is to not get too attached. If I didn't go through six ideas before Faceless, I probably still would have been trying to make that first idea work, and it just may not have worked at all. Maybe the idea wasn't good enough. Failing fast is a win-win. It there's no lose scenario with that. The third thing that comes to mind is to stay bootstrapped cuz staying bootstrapped forces you to build lean and and really focus on your value. If your idea is valuable to others, then you can scale healthfully. And if it's not, then you can move on and adapt quickly. You have options. So, I've been doing this since I've been young. I've always built things. But don't watch generic tutorials. Just pick a project that you're genuinely excited about and then learn everything you need to make that project real. You'll learn, you know, 10 times faster by building something you actually care about. And also, you can leverage your existing skills that you think might not apply to building a business. I don't think our marketing would have been as strong if I didn't have a storytelling background. And I don't think that, you know, a lot of what Jacob did, you know, come to fruition if he didn't have his background in the music industry and the advertising industry. Thank you, Alex. Thank you, Jacob, for coming on. The business you guys built is amazing. I'm sure it's going to keep growing. The fact you built it on Bubble is also amazing. I haven't heard of that before, but I think that's awesome. Thanks for coming on Starter Story and have a great day. Thank you so much for having us. Thank you. I love Jacob's story because he went from having basically no coding experience to building a million-dollar app. It's unreal to see how these AI tools are turning everyone into a builder and how they're getting better every single day. This is why we've been working on something called Starter Story Build. It's the place to learn about how to build with AI and how to turn your idea into a simple working production app that gets users and potentially can make money. In just 12 days, we'll guide you through the basics of building with AI and you'll get the skills to bring your ideas to life. If you're interested in checking out Starter Story Build, check the link in the description to learn more. Thank you guys again for watching. I'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: How I Built It: $9K/Month Micro-SaaS
VIDEO ID: npcL7oRZQlI
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcL7oRZQlI
================================================================================

My app does one thing and makes 9K a month. This is Leandro and he built an app that literally does just one thing. If you want to build a successful plugin, you need to understand this. But before the success, he was freelancing and doing side jobs until he came across a framework that changed everything. It has hundreds of business ideas waiting to be built. In this video, Leandro shares it all. How to quit freelancing and build for yourself. How to validate and build your idea in two weeks and this huge opportunity hiding in plain sight. All right, let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. Welcome Leandro to the channel. Thank you for coming on. Tell me about who you are, what you built and what's your story. My name is Leandro and I built an app that does only one thing and makes NK per month. Synto sheets is an add-on that runs on the sidear of Google Sheets and allows users to sync their notional databases to sheets. I built it in two weeks and it has been around for four years now. All right, cool. So, you built a plugin that makes $9,000 a month. Tell me a little bit more about this business and some of the numbers behind it. So, Cto Sheets runs on the side of Wool Sheets and it's kind of part of the Wool Workspace marketplace. We have more than 70K users in the application. We have more than 450 paying customers and we get kind of 5k visitors a month and lifetime revenue probably around 120k for the last four years. I could say that the last year or two years is where we made most of the money. All right. So, one reason why I wanted to bring you on the channel and what I love about your business is it just does one thing. I think that's super cool. Tell me a little bit about how you found this idea. So what happened four years ago I was building an integration between Google Sheets and another service. I was working with the sheets API. So I gained a lot of knowledge about it. And at that time notion released their official notion API. There was a a gap between what users needed and what's available in notion. So I said okay I need to validate if there's going to be a need for that kind of integration to sync Google sheets with notion. So what I did I went to Reddit I checked the subreddit of notion and search for keywords like sheets, Google sheets, excel, CSV, all related keywords to what I was trying to build and validate and I found a lot of people like trying to export the information from notion into sheets to work with the data. I was confident to build an MVP in two weeks. So I just built MVP and starting to find users and beta testers to to give a shot. Cool. Well, I mean I think that's super cool. If you're starting today, where would you go looking for more opportunities for this type of business? I believe Zapier is a good place to go and find those kind of opportunities. So, if you go to Zapier and you check for example the most common SAPs, you will see that pair of two applications for example are QuickBooks and sheets. There's a lot of companies and small businesses using QuickBooks for accounting and they need to move that information to check the invoices, the payment orders and everything and work with that data. And doing that in Sapier is kind of messy. You need to create different subs for updates, for creates, deletes, and everything. So, if you're able to build that in just one piece of software that does everything, you're going to be solving a huge pain point for customers. That's perfect. I love that. Let's take a step back. I know that you have an interesting background. You live in Buenos AIS, Argentina. Tell me about your background and how you got into building apps. So, I first study electronics engineering. I really love like taking things apart and and investigating everything. I went to college. College made me literally hate electronics. So that way I said, "Okay, I need to learn by myself." I chose JavaScript because in JavaScript you can build mobile apps, web apps and everything. So it took me kind of a year. Life got in the way. I did freelance in 8 years. It's kind of hard. You have an entrepreneur spirit. You want to make the decisions and sometimes you're not in charge. So yeah, I was kind of tired of that kind of work. I wanted to create my own schedule for the day, just be able to build things, be with a computer, and solve problems. I said, "Okay, I already have some savings. I already know how to code. I have the experience now. I want to give it a shot." It was during co that I decided to take that that step. I quit everything. No more clients, no more anything. And just decided to to build my own thing. Cool. Okay, let's get a little bit more technical here. I want to know about how you actually built this thing, how long it took to build and how you launched it. So the Adon is built using Appcript. Appcript is a language from Google services that allows you to extend Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and all Google services. So that's what I use to build the the UI and everything of the ADOM. Then I use VS Code as my coding editor to build MVP. As I mentioned before, it has some experience using the sheets API. So that really helped at the beginning to create the first version and and it took me yeah two two weeks no AI just stack overflow Google and and searching for for everything there. I love that. Let's talk about ideas. How do you go about finding ideas that can make money? Yeah, I'm not the kind of of guy that go looking for ideas and usually I read a lot blog post X YouTube videos. Ideas spark in my mind and I just write them down. I have a huge list of ideas. And it's funny when the same idea pops up different times. Those are the kind of ideas that you work on. But if I were to look for ideas, I could use I think Upwork could be a great place to find ideas because you can go there and see what people are looking for to build. And maybe if you can translate that into a known solution to offer to other users, I think there could be some really good insights in there. On that same note, let's talk about validating those ideas. Once you've come up with an idea and even potentially launched or thinking about launching it, how do you know if that idea is validated? What's your approach to that? Yeah, for new ideas, I usually first look if there is something that already exists that is similar or the same. Is this an enterprise solution? Is this for small businesses? Is this for for individuals? You can check the existing pricings to see what's the potential for for that idea. That's kind of the first step. Then if I'm going to continue building, I need to know that I'm gonna be able to have something that differentiates me from the rest of the products that already exist. If I can't find that angle, I maybe look for something else because if you're not able to differentiate yourself, it's going to be hard to enter into the market. And then yeah, try to find your first five users willing to try it out, right? Use Reddit, use X, use Facebook groups, LinkedIn groups as well. Having those users using the app while you're building it is amazing. like it's really like the insights and all the validation that you get that you're building exactly what they need is is super important. Cool. So, let's talk about MVP. I think a lot of people watching this may have tried to build stuff and sometimes when you get towards the end, you're not sure what features to include and what not to include. Tell me about how you approach that with your plug-in. First, I need to be able to transfer the information from one place to the other. No formatting, no anything. I just wanted the data to be there in sheets. And then I started to think about the user experience and what users could want the data to look like. And I realized they could want the data to look like similar to how it looks in notion. So that's when I added conditional formattings, data validation for select, for drop downs and everything. I also wanted the sync to work and allow users to move columns, hide columns. So I focus in those little details that make the difference. Right. Awesome. All right. Well, before we get into how Leandro turned this simple idea into a $9,000 per month micro SASS, let's talk about where the next big solo apps are being built. If you're a solo dev or SAS builder like Leandro, you know that marketplaces are one of the smartest ways to grow and build a business. You don't need an audience. You don't need to run ads. You just need to build something people already need where they already are. And one marketplace that's flying under the radar right now is monday.com. It's a multi-product platform with products for project management, CRM, service management, and more. They've got over 245,000 customers across over 200 industries. And over 90% of their enterprise customers use apps on the marketplace. That is massive built-in demand. And what's great is that the Money.com marketplace isn't saturated yet. So, this is a good chance to get in early and stand out while the opportunity is wide open. They've made it super dev friendly with robust APIs, MCP support, flexible SDKs, and a team that's actually invested in helping your app succeed. Plus, modernization is native. You set up the pricing, and they handle the billing and payments. We worked with them to put together this free ebook that breaks down the exact type of users on monday.com, what they need, and where the biggest opportunities are. Click the first link in the description to grab it, brainstorm your next idea, and start building. Thanks to monday.com for supporting the channel. Now, let's get back to Leandro's story. Let's talk about the launch of this. So, you built it and then what happened? Did you put it on the marketplace and how many users did you get? Tell me about what the launch process was like. Yes. So, the first step was to publish it to the Wool Works Pay Marketplace and then I started to spam a lot of famous groups related to notion and Reddit as well. So, I search keywords related to the product and started to have conversations with users both in the groups and in personal DMs. So, that way I got some some first users to try the application. And the same with the marketplace. Once application is in the marketplace, if there's someone looking for something notion related, they're going to find it and they're going to try it. Also, something that really helped was having a chat interface in the landing page at the beginning because that way you can have real conversations with customers and with users and try to understand what they need. All right. So, let's talk about growth. Uh, after you kind of launch this thing, you're posting on a bunch of forums. What did you do after that to actually start growing as a business and distribute and get your product in front of more people? Yeah. So, the first source of installs was of course the marketplace. That was super important. But I realized I needed to do SEO stuff. And so I started to think about what kind of blog post I could write that user can find interesting and related to notion and Google Sheets. So that's right now one of our main traffic channels. And I also use Reddit a lot. I have a service called F5 bot that is free that lets you track different keywords on Reddit. So I set up some keyword tracking related to CSV sheet sheets in that subreddit and every time I get an email with a notification that a new post or comment was added I just go there and reply. Of course you need to try to be not spammy and really give value to to the users and if your product can be a solution for the their problems then you recommend your product you say you are the founder. I also did a launch on product hunt a year and a half after launching the the product for the first time. So that's also was a really nice source of traffic, not paying customers, but yes, traffic and visibility. And I remember I also posted on Hacker News. I got to the front page. I was crazy the spike you get in traffic is amazing. But again, the same is doesn't translate into paying customers. It's just visibility, back links that improve domain rating, but that's it. That's great. All right. Well, let's get a little more technical here. U I'd love to hear about your tech stack. What kind of tools and languages do you use and have you used to build these products? So, TypeScript is my language. VS Code I use it as my editor. I have now started to use cursor a little bit. All my infrastructure is in Google Cloud and Firebase. I use S grid for transactional emails and marketing emails as well. Mix pan for analytics. I really love Mixpan because you are able to know exactly what each user is doing with application. I use paddle as my payment processor instead of stripe because stripe is not available in Argentina. And I use TIO as a customer support tool to have the chat in the in the landing page. It takes time but it gives you like a lot of insights and direct communication with with your customers and I think that even at the beginning is super important. That's awesome. On that same note, can you actually share with me the costs and the margin of a business like this? Yeah, of course. So I guess in in terms of percentage of margin is 90%. My main expense right now is cloud infrastructure because again you are kind of syncing between two services and you are doing that all the time in real time. So there's a lot of compute going on but apart from that the rest of the tools are cheap. It's not a huge expense. Cool. All right. Okay. So you built this successful business. It's making $9,000 a month somewhat on autopilot. What have you learned through this process that surprised you? It was crazy to realize how small changes affect the business. Moving a button, changing a text or just moving things around in the UI can have such a profound impact. Sometimes just small decisions make a lot of difference. At the beginning, we had a free plan. And I realized that a lot of users were just using the free plan and that was enough for them. They didn't needed to pay. So I made a decision to remove the free plan. It was risky. There was a lot of people angry about that. But basically in that moment we went from 5K to 8K in few months I think. So yeah, just a small decision that makes a huge different to the business. That's amazing insight. I'd love to hear about what your typical day in the life looks like. You're running an ad that makes $9,000 a month. What does a typical day look like for you in Argentina? So I have a 2-year-old child. We usually wake up at 7 7:30. Prepare some mates breakfast. I go with him to the kinderg. After that, I'm ready to to start working. I usually work in a spikes. So, when I have to do development, I kind of put together a lot of task, do a huge spike of work and then I chill, spike, chill. That's kind of my way of working. And I try to do things that are going to make a difference. If I see that a task or something is not going to move the needle, I just don't do it and focus my time in something else. Cool. Last question that we ask all founders who come on Starter Story. uh if you could stand on Leandro's shoulders when you were, you know, a freelancer trying to find that business idea, what advice would you give him? Yeah, I think it's super important to at least find your first user that is willing to pay for your application. What happened to me with some other products is that you build it for free first, you have a lot of usage and as soon as you start charging, then they don't use the application anymore. So that's the moment when you realize that there was not enough value for them. So charging from the beginning, I think, is super important. Do not waste time building something that no one is going to be willing to pay for. And then when you realize that it's going to work, just go for it. All right. Well, that was great. Thanks for coming on, Leandro. I love your story. I love the business that you built. Hopefully, you'll be building a bunch more cool plugins and grow to 100K MR. And we'll see you next time. Thanks for coming on. Thank you for having me. It was super fun. I wanted to thank Leandro again for coming on the channel. I love his story because he's proof that you can take a simple idea and turn it into a really solid business. My favorite part about his business is that although it's not a massive huge million-dollar business, it's a super cool business that kind of works on autopilot, it's great for developers, and again, like we said, it just does one thing. If you're interested in building something similar, and you're serious about actually doing this, I'd encourage you to check out Starter Story Build. In 2 weeks, you'll come up with an idea, you'll build it, and you'll launch it and come out the other side with a real live production app. I'll put the link in the description if you want to check that out. But otherwise, thank you guys for watching. I'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: How to Use AI to Find a $1M Idea [Reddit, Claude]
VIDEO ID: L_FY6aW9cJ4
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_FY6aW9cJ4
================================================================================

The human brain is not wired to come up with a good business idea. Ego, bias, and overthinking, it often gets in the way. So, what if you could outsource the whole process to AI? AI. Well, the models just haven't really been powerful enough for this, but it's about to change. And that's exactly what we're going to show you today because I brought in one of the smartest people in the space, Steph France. Today, we're going to walk through something called the gold mining framework. Six tools, five prompts, 45 minutes. We'll go from nothing to a potential million-dollar business idea and a complete landing page to go with it without writing a single line of code or copy. What's even cooler is you can follow along step by step and at the end of this video, you can have one, too. Watching this video will potentially change the way you think about ideas forever. So, let's go. I'm Pat Walls, and this is the Starter Story Playbook. Welcome Steph, welcome to the channel. I'm glad to have you on. So you're going to show off today your new framework that you haven't unveiled yet which is the gold mining framework. Could you walk us through that? Hi Pat. So I'm I'm really glad to be here at first. I'm Steph France. I qualify myself as a curious marketer and uh I'm I love the game of marketing and and looking forward to present this framework. So this is a landing page for a co-arenting app. The landing page was created only with this framework A to Z. And if you have some knowledge in marketing, you can see that this is a really good marketing copy. And this landing page was created in an hour. And before starting the process, I had absolutely no idea about any problem in this niche. And the cool thing is that it takes all the pain points, all the wording from the people in this industry and put them in the landing page. So it's it's literally telling the customer their pain point in their own language and on boarding. Okay. All right. Let's dive in. Steph, can we go over what is the first step of the framework? So the first step is to find a market to explore. The idea is to start with what you have some edge or what you are interested in within the three core markets which are health, wealth and relationship which are markets which for sure people are okay to spend money. So you are already reducing the risk. So let's take an example and we would only open the health market. Within this market, we have a lot a lot of categories and subcategories and niches and subniches and sub subniches. We can go very very deep in this market. But for now, let's say for example, you are you are really into stress management, but you think like okay, that's not enough. I want more stress management. Fine. In this case, we are going to use a prompt. It's the market idea expander. And the goal is that if you put a subniches, any subniche or subcategory, it will continue expand in the category you want to dig into. And this is a little trick. Markdown is a language that needs to be used as much as possible when we talk with LLM. So instead of just copy and past, it works as well, but it's really better if we copy as markdown. So we keep the structure of the prompt. The LLM we work with doesn't matter. You can pick the one you like. I tend to prefer working with clo for different reasons. The first is that I think it's the most human like LLM. Yeah. So the copyrightiting is good and it's there is more emotion in the copyrightiting. I always tend to go with cloud whenever I can and when I need something specific for example the 1 million token uh context window in the same conversation then I would go with Germany for example. But for the sake of this example, we won't go too far into the the size. So we will work with cloth. All right. So I simply copy the code and I just did CtrlV and then I have the prompt that is copied here. And that's fine if it looks like that. It's just that clothes reads the markdown this row. Now it says okay I'm I'm ready to help you. Just tell me which market do you want to go into. So we said to stress management and now we have at at first we have health and this is stress management and then now below stress management we have physical stress relief, massage therapy, breathing techniques, mental stress management and then within those we have meditation, guided meditation, mindfulness meditation. All those potential markets can be the market that you are going to explore. And now the decision is for you to first it's with what you like then it's what you have an edge on which means do you have knowledge do you have network do you have anything that can be uh at your advantage to go in this market or if you don't have any then just pick one that sounds good. Okay, so we talked about how to finding a market. Now, how do we validate that there's demand for this market or what do we do next? When we first pick a market, we we don't know if it's a good market to go in. And that's what the step two is all about. We use Google as well as a Chrome extension which is keyword everywhere to quickly find the volume of search and all related keywords that can orientate us until we find something that is interesting to go further to to dig deeper and then we look at the list that we have. For example, let's say Swedish massage. It's still a big one. And then I could find potentially another subniche by looking into the different program. What do we have? Best massage technique, massage therapy description, Swedish massage history. Okay, if I go down, I have Swedish massage near me. Okay, 20 20,000 search. This is a very interesting query. And then we use Google Trends which is one of the best tools to use when it comes to market research to know if we have a trending market or at least a stable market. And now we have switch message and we want to understand the difference between search term and topic. Topic will basically take all the related search term on Google and also in all different languages. So when you have a topic it's already like it's a big thing. Sometimes you only have search term but when you have topic you just use the topic and for this sake uh we can see that is the trending market actually it's not too bad there is some kind of uh going down and we can see that probably here in COVID where it was not crazy it's a well trend because usually when a trend has so much research you won't see those very big pike here you have them so I wouldn't say it's a solid trend because we can see it's up and down but it's a good trend. So we know for Swedish message it's a good one but it could be better. Now let's look at other ones. For example, if I go back to my tree core markets and I go to relationship here in family relationship we have parenting. Within parenting we obviously have a lot of things way more than that. But one that I have explored previously and that I found there is a lot of demand is co-arenting. And if I start digging into co-arenting, let's see what we have. So here we have 40,000 search. And if we dig into it a little bit more, we can see co-arenting app. That's interesting. Which means people are already aware that there are apps out there maybe or they're looking for it. Okay. Carenting concealing. So that means I have a problem. I'm looking for a solution. Co-parenting classes. Okay, I I need someone to help me. Those are very good signs. And now if I do the same and I use Google trend and here I have a topic again which is cool. This is a good solid trend. So there there are le less fluctuation and it's a growing trend. So here we are not talking about all the AI huge trend that goes up and down and the tool comes up and it dies 3 months after. Here we are talking about human needs. Yeah. Society changes that creates needs that are growing and growing and growing and those markets are big. So creating a business in the co-arenting niche it's totally viable. Doesn't mean that as long as soon as you are in the caparinting niche, you succeed. But at least it's definitely possible to find a problem and solve it in the coparing niche. Okay, so we validated the demand. Now what do we do next? We are now at the third step of the framework. We want to gather data. Now we need to find where are the people talking about their frustrations, their pain about co-arenting specifically and the best mind we actually have is Reddit. Why? Because Reddit is literally the place on the internet where the world is talking and the world is sharing their program because there is this anonymous kind of mindset and long conversation on Reddit that makes it a real gold mine when it comes to find customer pain points. So in the step three, we go on Google to find Reddit threads. But we will use a special special query with advanced search on Google to surface the Reddit threads where people are talking about their problem expressing their pain. So we go straight to the point straight where the important part is for us together. So I think I feel I was I have been uh I experienced all the the the words that that would filter someone that is experiencing or explaining or asking about a specific problem. It's not 100% right but it filters a lot of answer compared to what we could have only with the Reddit search. So I simply copy this one which you also have here within the document is the Google query. So you have market to explore. You just put your market here. Copy that and go on Google. And now this is the moment where we need to be careful and do the thing I mentioned earlier which is carefully say read and choose the right thread. In this case, we're not spending going to spend an hour reading, but I I would tend to always go into it and make sure that all the subreddit that I chose are relevant. For example, this one, we have 60 uh comments and it it was 5 months ago. This is co-parenting and this is from the subreddit co-arenting. So, we are right into what we are looking for here. How did you make your piece with co-arenting? Definitely about promps just when you think you have this whole co-arenting thing. Okay, 40 comments one months ago. I guess this one is probably interesting. Share the positive experience with co-arenting. Why not? If you don't have better, why not? Co-arenting. I was wrong. Okay. Here we have blended family for the subreddit struggling with current partners perspective on okay we are going to keep it short but you can go on and on. Now the next step is going to be extremely simple. We are going to copy and paste. So we simply open text block. I copy the the complete thread enter three dash just to say to the AI okay I'm having another thread putting that on side. Okay, next one. Let's go down right away and move up. Going back to my text block here. Past thread dash next thread. Sometimes it can be a lot of data. In this case, we just work with a few. But if you have like 20 re Reddit thread, good. All right. So now we got all of our data. We got all of our Reddit threads. What's next? All right. So the step four now we process the data. And for that we have three major prompts that we are going to use one after the other. The first one will extract all the pain points and refine them. So we have different categories and we have quotes from the people attached to the specific painoint. All right. So we just come to the Google doc copy as markdown and we go back to cloud new chat brand new chat and we simply copy here on cloud. You can just copy like that. Now I'm just grabbing my data and I'm passing here. same. So we have first the title, the designation of the painoint and then we have a small description. So parents feel pressure to maintain unrealistic friendly relationship with ex partners for the sh sake of their children often at the expense of their own boundaries or current relationship. And the cool thing is we have here quotes from the conversation that are related to this painoint here. For example, it's hard to cooperent with your abuser, which is a very good one. I find this type of post on death like I feel to share your coopering success, but don't make statement like try your absolute hardest to do this for the kids. We can see that those are deep conversation and they are all related to this specific pain point. And if we go down, we have navigating new relationship while co-arenting. So that's another set of problem. Then dealing with high conflict and neglectful exartners. probably another one emotional labor imbalance in blended families I don't know exactly okay parents feel their shoulder are unequal burden of emotional and practical labor labor in blended families especially when caring for stepchildren without reciprocal care of their biological children that's a more complic complex one but this is the kind of thing that you can only come up with when when you go deep into this kind of conversation So let's uh move on to the next one the market gap generator which will take all those pain points and a framework which includes new parading new technology differentiation basically how to find good business ideas in a saturated market which like every market is saturated. This is why it's trained on this framework. Now we copy everything. Ctrl+ A copy as markdown. Come back here and then paste and let it run. Now it's going to work from the framework before and come up with different business ideas. Here we have the different market segmentation framework is the the approach of finding business ideas and those three business ideas are within this framework. Okay. Solution one coarent ally conflict focus coarenting platform description a specialist platform platform designed specifically for high conflict coopering situation with built-in documentation tools communication filters I think this one is really interesting and third party imagation features that's a very interesting one now we have product differentiation framework so uh child- centered custod transition tool okay a specialized application focused solely on making children transition between household less traumatic with pre-transition preparation tool, emotional check-in and structural handoff protocols. Sounds pretty good. And then the last part is when we pick a business idea, which means it's just a simple choice. This is the one I'm interested in. We have the landing page prompt creator which will take all the learnings we have the business idea we want to create and we'll transform it in uh prompts that we are going in lovable to create our landing page. The last one is a little bit confusing because we have a prompt to create a prompt to finally create our landing page but it's only copy and past. Let's pick the one that uh talks to you the most and we simply highlight it and copy it. And now we are going to just tell Claude this is the one I want to go for. All right. And now we are going to pass the next prompt which is the landing page prompt creator. What is this prompt? Just before we go into it I I'm going to simply let it run and then I will explain. Now I just pass the prompt and run. So this prompt is basically as it's made from a research specifically on lovable the tool that allows to create apps very fast. this specific tool. The research went out there on the internet. Basically, CHPT went out there on the internet and looked for all the best practices to create tool to create prompts for loable as well as all the documentation about Loable. gathered everything and then from that I created a prompt that is made to take all the data that we have here in the in the context and create a new prompt specifically for lovable using all the best practices to prompt for loable. Okay, so we've processed all the data and we've come up with our master prompt. What's next? So now we have our prompt that normally if everything works we just put that into loable and we have our landing page. We're not going to read that one because it's it's made by AI for AI. So it's pretty boring but we are simply going to copy it and we go into lowable and then we start running. Whoa, look at that. Let's publish. All right. Transform custody transitions from tearful breakdowns to peaceful goodbyes for separated parents whose children struggle with household transition. Transition garden provides structured tools to reduce anxiety and create predictable child centered handhov without requiring perfect co-arenting relationship. Wow. Okay. We have the features child-friendly condom tool. Oh, nice. uh structure handoff protocol that minimize parent conflict during exchanges. Emotional check-in system designed by child psychologist. You have to execute on that, but it's a good feature. Documentation that helps identify and address transition patterns. Yeah. And we have even uh a nice FAQ. Do Bosar need to use transition garden for it to work? Uh what age? And we have a form. Wow. That's it. We have it. Yeah, we have it. That's amazing. I mean, there you guys have it. That is the gold mining framework. I really wanted to just get it from idea to landing page and see if we could do it. And we did. And I don't think there's any video or any lesson like this on YouTube currently. And it just blows my mind, you know, these AI tools and how this is going to change how, you know, how you can find ideas. But what would be the next steps for someone? Let's say they went through this whole process in turning this into a real idea. You mentioned maybe talking to some customers or something like that. So if I may push one of my YouTube videos, but uh I have a YouTube video that is actually exactly for that. What we just seen takes one big part of the whole process. But this video from 0 to one explains how you can think of using a quiz to create a waiting list asking the right question. Because even though you have the perfect landing page with the perfect copy for very specific program in a trendy market going from there to having the business having an app running is still a lot of work and and yeah cursor can do it fast but no it's still a lot of work and before you go into that you can if you are familiar with those tools then just build it and and try try it and and post everywhere and then if you have users it's fine you can go build first and and then see but if you are not Sure. And if it's a lot of time investment and if your time is reduced then I would always go by validating again. And for that I love to use quizzes. So you simply tell to people you show the page and then on the page there is a popup that says thank you for being for being here. The app is in development right now. We are a small team and we would love to have your take on uh on your current program. Would you mind answering a few questions? You ask a few questions and you say, "Do you want us to let you know when the app is out there?" And most people would say yes. And then you have a list. You can post everywhere about that and you grow your list. And and you you decide for yourself. You okay, when I have a 100 people on my waiting list, I'm building the app as fast as as I can. You build it. You launch it to the list via email the the way you prefer and and it starts. Perfect. Okay. All right. If you guys want to get access to this right now and you want to use this yourself, just click the first link in the description. We put it all in there and it's totally free. And thank you guys for watching. I hope you enjoyed this. Leave a comment if you'd like to have Steph come back on and share more business idea frameworks or even potentially some marketing and growth frameworks as well. So, thanks for coming on, Steph. That was awesome. I think this is going to change the world. All right, I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I really think that this is just an amazing space to be right now building in AI and building with AI tools. And look, these AI coding tools are powerful, but they're not magic yet. It's still really early days. I know that this space can feel really overwhelming and it's moving really fast. So, it's important to have the right system and right framework to follow. So, shameless plug here, but we've been working on something for a while. If you watch this, you found an idea and you want to take action on that idea, well, I'm excited to announce Starter Story Build, which is our platform for learning AI tools and learning how to leverage AI tools to turn them into real ideas and real apps. Our flagship program is the AI app accelerator. This is way more than just a course or a video on how to build stuff. You get to walk away with a realworld app built completely with AI plus skills that might just change your life. Not only will you learn how to use these tools and build stuff you never thought possible, but this program will give you structure, accountability, and push you to actually take action, get it done, and ship. What's even cooler is we have office hours with AI coding experts to help you when you eventually get stuck, cuz everyone gets stuck. And there's a whole other cohort of people building alongside of you and building apps. So, if you're curious about actually building something and you want to surround yourself with other builders doing the same thing, then head to the first link in the description to see if the AI app accelerator might be worth it for you. All right, guys. Thanks for watching. I'll see you in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: I Built an App with Cursor, Made $30K, and Quit My Job.
VIDEO ID: jpSY4MlWX50
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpSY4MlWX50
================================================================================

I prompted my way to $30,000 without writing a single line of code. This guy made $30,000 from an app he built on his morning commute. How? Two tools, Cursor and Bolt. I think a lot of people make cool stuff with Bolt and Cursor nowadays, but they don't monetize it because they need In this video, we'll go over the wild story of how Polus just built, launched, and marketed a SAS product by himself and got traction in about 30 days. you probably have like a winning idea already that you could just prompt your way and start building. Why you should definitely tune into this video? Well, I had Polus share with me his exact process on screen of how he builds fast with AI tools, how he creates beautiful designs and how you can too. And how making money and marketing your app is as simple as a couple tweets. All right, let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. Welcome, Polus, to the channel. Thanks for coming on. Tell me, what's your story? My name is Polus and I used AI to build an app that made me 30K. It's an app that matches startups with influencers and I built and launched it 7 months ago. It's got over a,000 users at the moment with over 350 paid users. I used Bolt and Cursor to make it and I use Framer for design. I did it all myself without needing a team all in my daily commute. Nice. Cool. Before you made 30K with your app, tell me a little bit more about your background, your story as an entrepreneur. It started when I was 18 and I needed to make money to get my way through college and the only job that I could get was door to door sales and one day I ended up knocking on the wrong door and someone literally grabbed me and held a knife to my throat. After that, I just had enough and I wasn't really employable as a student. So, I dove into every side hustle that I could. So I did web design, I did copywriting, sales funnels. I became kind of like a generalist. It paid enough to get my way through university. When I was in university, I did computer game development. But funny story, I actually completely sucked at code. I was very visual and I just couldn't understand it. But now AI can actually code for you. And so the limitations that I had before are kind of removed. AI can do the heavy lifting in terms of code and kind of patch up the area where I'm not the best at. Nice. So tell me what got you into building online and and realizing that you could, you know, make money online. So I was going through kind of a rough patch because I tried all these different business models and I wasn't making enough money to break free from a 9 to5. I got really frustrated one day that none of the things that I did really got me where I wanted to be. So I was pursuing creatorled services and products just work with creators and the idea of a database came to my mind and I just started building it out because it's something I'd use myself and I figured with AI I could turn this into a fullyfledged SAS if enough people wanted it. So I really just gave it a spin as kind of like experiments and it did pretty good. So tell me what it felt like to finally launch and have this validated idea and have it make its first dollar. Tell me about that. So for months before launch, I was building this database. It was a lot of effort and I had no idea it would pay off. So when I launched my application, I remember I was sitting with my girlfriend and we were just having dinner. I pull up my phone. I just see sale after sale. I was like, "Okay, how long is this going to keep going for?" And that night got about like 20 or 30 different sales. So it was very nice feeling that just motivated me to just keep going and pursue this further cuz now I felt like that was a validation that this could be a real product. Okay. So can you share your step-by-step playbook on how you build MVPs with AI? If I'm a complete beginner, I would recommend everyone to use Perplexity. It's what I did. I just asked Perplexity because it has the most upto-ate information. So it has all the documentation, anything that you want to any tool, any library, just tell it you're a complete noob and absolutely don't know how to do anything and it'll give you really detailed step by step because it's deep research. It'll pull up a long document that you can reference and just follow along. The next step is I'd pull up Bolt and just take it one step at a time as well. So I would implement the first thing that Replexity says. So it could be like the dashboard, importing the project, cloning a GitHub repository if there is. Once I'm in there, I just keep prompting it and if there's errors, I just throw the error back at the AI. It fixes the error, go onto the next thing, and I use Bolt to a point where I get a nice looking MVP with the functionality. And then I take that, download the project, I put it into cursor. And here is where I hook up like superbase. So it writes all the scripts to connect the back end. and I get clerk off and that makes it very simple to plug and play the authentication. And this is all steps that perplexity can provide for you. So you can just ask questions along the way and it'll give you some solutions. Replexi is a great starting point. Bolt is a great way to make the MVP and then you move to cursor to dial in the details. So you're 80% of the way there and cursor will then just get you to the final finish line. have users authenticating. You have a backend with real data and with a bit of prompting and some scoring, it'll make it secure as well. Okay, Polus is proof that it's never been easier or faster to build an app in 2025. Tools like Cursor and GPT4 make it possible to go from idea to product in a weekend. But if you don't understand your customer or what they're searching for and how they describe their problems, then you're just building fast in the wrong direction. That's why we're excited to partner with Seamrush for this video. It's one of the best tools out there for figuring out what people actually want. You can plug in an idea and see what people are searching for, what's getting traffic, and where the gaps are. It's got 26 billion plus keywords across 140 countries. And yeah, most people think that it's just an SEO tool, but trust me, it's way more than that. You can use it to validate your idea before you build, find high intent keywords your competitors are ignoring, or even spin up landing pages that match what people are already looking for. I'm going to show you how you can find successful business ideas just like Polus is in Semrush with one search right now. Go to Seamrush and find their topic research tool. Search any topic or niche. Let's just do Tik Tok influencer since that's kind of similar to Polus' business, but you could literally just search anything. And I'm going to open some of the cards that look interesting like this one. Tik Tok influencer marketing. On here, you can see all the questions people are literally plugging into search engines. These are the real problems people have and are actively looking for a solution. I like this one because it's not a super high keyword difficulty and there's high volume of people searching for it. So maybe there's some lowhanging fruit in there. And look right here, Tik Tok influencer search platform. What's the best way to hire Tik Tok influencers? Polus' business can literally be tied back to a single page in Seamrush. And that's just crazy powerful if you ask me. Right now, they're offering a free 7-day trial to try out all 55 tools in the platform. Just head to the first link in the description if you want to try it out. All right, let's get back to it. We talked about the code building an MVP. Let's talk about one thing that I think is really cool about your stuff is how good it looks. How do you use AI to design amazing looking websites? It's really the simplest it can be. First thing I do is I pull up Framer and I pick a free template. So any template that you see on there that you like. It's simple enough and clean for you to edit. And then you just have to pick a nice font and a nice button. And then the rest just needs to be simple and clean. The most important part is just to get out. Focus on just editing the template really quick and just put it out there. Cool. Based on what you built and what you've learned working on lots of marketing stuff and also on your own, what do you think is like the most important thing to focus on when you're creating a good landing page and a good design? So, I focus 80% of my time on everything that's above the fold. We'd call this the hero section. This the first thing that people see when they open the website and has to have the your full message just out there and people really need to grab an understanding of what it is within the first couple seconds. Anything that you can save them time with, save them money. Anything that solves a painful problem, you should have in a headline and a subheading, and then just a big call to action. All right, so we talked about landing page design, which was awesome, but what about UI design? When you're building an app, how do you use AI to design UI and UX? When I'm building it out in cursor, you get the basic thing done and then you add some things to it. So, the more features you add, the more things you work on, it's got to stay clean. and it's got to stay cohesive and you got to make sense. So for everything UI related, I just ask it to make it clean, functional, and modern. And I try to have it use like shad CN components and they're all free. But when I have ideas and when you have ideas for how you want onboarding flow to be or some other elements of the app, what I would suggest is just creating something in Figma, you can doodle if you want. You just plug it into cursor and just explain the behavior that you want and then it'll spit out a nice looking page for you. All right. Well, thanks for sharing that. Let's dive into the marketing side of things cuz uh seems like X Twitter has really been working well for you. Tell me about that strategy. Show me a tweet that really took off for you and and let's talk about that. So, this post did the most in terms of numbers. It got close to 500k impressions. And I think the reason it worked is because I found an angle to attach it to trends happening in the space. A lot of people when they're building in public never go viral because they never join the bigger conversation and human attention span is limited. So it's 100 times easier to just bring your ideas to where the focus is already happening. So this post had you know nice simple visual demo has like real like raw human like reaction but most importantly it tapped into the main debate at the time which was is AI coding actually good enough to build a full SAS. Thanks for sharing that. I'd love if you just shared a little bit more about the bigger strategy here the bigger thing which is build in public. I love if you just talked about that from you know kind of strategy perspective or what you love about building in public and why it's worked for you. So for me what's worked is just shipping often. don't just have like one big video release like a lot of VC startups. So, for example, I tapped into the influencer conversation that was happening at the time. I saw Mark Lou posting a similar format. So, I figured I'd get some inspiration and then convert it into a post for Creator Hunter. What's not worked for me and what I see is there's been like a lot of competitors and copycats that come up, but they never really take off because either they're copying the exact same thing and people see right through that and you need an edge that no one can easily copy with AI tools nowadays. Nice. That's a good strategy. Okay, so now the exciting part. Let's talk about tech stack. What tools, languages, or whatever else you use to build this business? And if you don't mind me asking, what are the generally the costs to run this business? What kind of margins are we looking at? I use perplexity for the game plan, bold for the functional MVP, cursor for making it production ready. I use Versal which is free and then Superbase also free and then API for scraping. In terms of costs and margins, so it's about 90%. All right. So what I want to ask you is, you know, you you built a bunch of stuff and you finally seeing success with Creator Hunter. What have you learned during that process that surprised you? I'm getting a lot of questions as well about how I did it and people want the sauce on how to build stuff and build stuff fast. I think you can just start prompting and just prompt your way to making something and sell it. I think people underestimate the knowledge they already have. So like if you have like a deep domain knowledge, you probably have like tons of ideas already on what to build and you probably have like a prompt your way and start building. I like that. Cool. All right. Now that you are working on this full-time, tell me what a day in the life looks like for you for now building Creator Hunter. Yeah, so it's a big change. More traveling and more work. When I was building out the MVP and was at the same time traveling to China, New York, France, and seeing revenue while you're out and about exploring is a nice feeling. It's a real blessing. But I've been working on it full-time on Creator Hunter since the 24th of December when I quit the job. So some days there's more hours that I put in this than my 9 to5. But I don't feel exhausted at all. Cool. I like that. Well, the last question that we asked anybody that comes on starter story is if you could give advice to young polus maybe a couple years ago. What would you tell them? I think never underestimate how much you can do solo. AI as your CTO is like a superpower. I I don't know how long this period of time will last, but we need to take advantage of it. Whatever ideas you have, you can probably execute it in a weekend. If you just figure out the most scrappy idea possible in the most scrappy way possible, you can get it out there. And then if you put a buy button on it, share it on Twitter in the most scrappy way or Tik Tok, I think you'll be surprised by the amount of people that actually want to get it. Well, that's great advice. Thanks for coming on, Polus. I love what you built. You're going to be a massive success. Keep building, keep going, and uh hopefully we'll see you back on the channel. Thank you. Thanks, Polus, for coming on. I think his story is amazing and it's proof that anybody right now can build anything with AI. I mean, he just got started. He built a bunch of stuff and throughout that process found the idea that would change everything. I see a lot of people waiting for the right time to start and just sitting on the sidelines while others like Polus are just getting started playing around with these tools, throwing at the wall and shipping stuff every week. If you got started right now and started playing with these tools and shipping stuff, imagine where you'd be in two weeks. Yes, it's early and not everything is perfect, but the early bird gets the bag. So, if you're serious about shipping, want to build something real and put it out into the world, check out Starter Story Build. I put the first link in the description. Let's build. Thanks for watching. I'll see you guys in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: I Got Rejected From YC, Then Built a $200M Startup
VIDEO ID: PSx0vcUY-sk
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSx0vcUY-sk
================================================================================

All right, Saba, what's your story? Meet Saba. I grew up in the middle of nowhere. I was always like relatively entrepreneurial, but never had any major direction. The self-made entrepreneur who transformed no money, no validation, no funding into a multi-million dollar success story. If other people have done it, why are they so special? Why can't we do it? In 2018 with his co-founder Tim, they spotted an opportunity to start an online business. Nothing but pure hustling got the ember started. It was just brute force. When he and Tim launched their video startup V, they bet everything. No money, no validation, no funding, kicked out of your office. Your interns quit. This is a journey of persistence and brute force. We had no more money in our bank accounts, not being able to afford the train. So yeah, it was a pretty dark place. Would not go there again. Chasing your own dreams. Ask yourself this. If you knew how hard it would be, would you do it? This is the story of how Saba Kenned turned rejection into 10, 20, 30, 40 million in revenue. [Laughter] Welcome to Starter Story. I grew up in the middle of nowhere and I was one of those people because I lived in the middle of nowhere who just spent a lot of time on the internet. Everything I read about technology was like super exciting and through getting a cracked version of Photoshop, I decided to learn how to make graphics and images. I thought that was quite a lot of fun. So that kind of led me into going to college and then university to study design. After I graduated from university, I yeah, I got a job like you're you're told to. Uh and in my first week at the job, I wanted to quit and actually just do my own thing. I didn't want to be on the treadmill. I didn't want to have a job. I didn't want to have a normal, you know, semi- detached house in the suburbs. I wanted to just like do what I wanted to do. I wanted to own my own time. And I felt like starting the company was probably the only way to actually do that. And then I read in a free newspaper, the app Candy Crush made a million pounds a day. And I was like, I think I could make an app. I met my co-founder Tim a year after university through this like global hackathon thing. We met online, met up for a coffee, decided to work on some stuff. I don't know, like when you're young, you want to build something. The first thing you need to work out how to do is actually are we capable of putting something together. And I know that might sound silly, but like the first thing you've got to do is actually go through the cycle once of, hey, we bought a domain. Cool. We now to make a back end, great. We know how to make a landing page. Perfect. So, I think like a lot of the early tries that we had around like different ideas was just can we get something up and running? We'd worked on projects for two or three years together. A lot of those early ideas failed, but I was just really all in and I was like, we're going to make it work. The early days were really simple. It was like me and him in a co-working space at his university being like, cool, we know we want to make something in video because we're both really passionate about that space and we and we see like the early signs of it becoming really interesting. And the idea was like super simple, like you know, video editing, I've done it for years. I'm a really like technical person, but I find it quite hard. Can we like build basic video editing tools in the browser? Like super basic. And I was like really inspired by Gy's GIF editor. It was just like upload a video, add text, trim it, done. I was like, can we do something similar like that for video? That was kind of like the initial idea. We just thought that if other people have done it, why are they so special? Why can't we do it? And yeah, we went all in. We probably had about enough runway for a year. We literally made like no progress. So, I'd normally wake up at 6:00 in the morning, uh, get on my bike, head to the office at 6:30, get there for about 7, and again, just to let you know how frugal we were. When I say office, I mean co-working space. And when I mean co-working space, I mean me and Tim shared the entry card. And then yeah, we'd do that until what, 7, 8 at night, go to the gym, cycle on the bike furiously for an hour, come back, work again, and then try and pick up some discount food on the way home because uh cuz it was late all the, you know, you get half price in different places in London. So I'd do that and then go to sleep and do it again. Rinse and repeat. We were using this like crisp chat and I remember email them being like, "Hey guys, we can't afford 100 bucks a month. Can you do less?" They're like, "Yeah, yeah, 20 $20 a month, fine." So like everything we would like nickel and dime every single purchase um to just keep operating expenses as low as possible. We ended up in this like VC's office working and those VCs then kicked us out of their office. So we're now like officeless. The interns that we hired both quit on the same day and we were like stuck. We tried to get funding and we got rejected like many many many times and we both had crypto fortunately and we had to sell it to keep the company going. Right. two years of no money, no validation, nothing, no funding, kicked out of your office, your interns quit. It felt like it all unraveled. It was like a really, really tough time. Even like going to see friends for their birthdays, not being able to afford the train, all commuting around the city was on a bike. Lunch every day was like pre-made. I couldn't go out and see friends on Friday because they'd want to go for dinner or go for drinks, and I couldn't afford that. Just totally scraping by. And everyone at the same time is, you know, progress, you know, they're in their late 20s, they're progressing in their careers, they're buying houses, and there's me who's just like emptied my bank account. So, we both now have jobs at this point. And that was nice because, you know, finally I can like, you know, do normal things with normal people again and visit my friends and go for dinner. But at the same time, we still even at that point took half of our salaries every month religiously, put it back into the company account and then used that money to hire two other engineers who would build for us who yeah really helped us build the company today. And over the next like 8 9 months, things started to really take off. We went from like zero users to 30,000 monthly users in like 9 months. We've got some money saved up now. We've got users. They're not paying, but maybe maybe we're on to something. Hey there, this is Pat. I'm the creator of this channel, and I'm actually working on this video right now. What happens next to these guys is actually what inspired me to create this video, and it has to do with them getting rejected on a really big stage. What also inspires me is the sponsor of this video, Post Talk. But hold on, before you fast forward, I want to show you something crazy right now on my computer. I'm on v.io's io's site right now the company that Saba founded and I'm inspecting the code and look what they use Post hog I'll do the same on my site and you can see we use Post hog too why because it's a great analytics tool that all startups and online businesses should use if they want to grow I can tell you all about their features but instead I'll just jump in and show you how I use it every single day so this is Post Hog I use the product analytics feature the most but they also of amazing stuff like web analytics, session replay, AB testing, and way more. Anytime we launch something new at Starter Story, I go to Post Hog and create a new report with the most important data points, study the data, make changes, and then I can see exactly how those changes actually impact the data. I'll pop into this report right here where I can track conversion on our homepage. What's also cool is I can drill down by source, run AB tests on this, and more. These dashboards fuel our business. I mean, just look at how many different ones I have saved on here. There's just no other tools this powerful in the market. You can set it up with just one line of code and the free plan is super generous. A million events for free and after that it's fractions of a penny per event. Crazy. So, if you want to try out Post Hog, and you should cuz why not, hit the first link in the description. You can install it for free, but please when you go there, tell them you came from Starter Story. All right, let's get back to the story. We got to about 30,000 monthly users. We both have full-time jobs. We have these two guys helping us out on the side. And we've saved up enough money at this point that we're like, maybe we should try to apply to Y Combinator, this like famous startup accelerator. We've got good traction at this point, 30,000 monthly users. We've shown we're like super gritty because we've been doing it for 2 years. We've invested all our money in it multiple times over and we think that maybe this is our like big break. We apply and to our amaze event, we get in to this interview round and you know, we've been through so much to get to this point. We go into the interview, we come out. The way that White Combinator works is really simple. If you get in, they give you a call. If you don't get in, they send you an email rejection letter. So that evening, we're like refreshing our phone, waiting for the email, and we think to ourselves, I think we got it. I think we got it. And I looked at this email and it was like, sorry. you know that you know that first line it always gets you the first line the rejection just gets you that unfortunately this batch you haven't been selected. We're looking at this rejection email that we got and there's another line that stood out to me and it says we don't understand why you haven't charged your users or something like that. And so we thought to ourselves, why don't we try and implement their feedback over the weekend and then email them on Monday or basically just go to the Y combinator office and be like, "Guys, we saw your feedback. We hear you. We've implemented it. We've actually got paid users. Will you change, you know, will you reconsider us?" Bang on. 9:00 a.m. Monday morning, we sent them an email like, "Hey guys, thank you so much for your feedback. We implemented it. We got 20 paid users. Would you reconsider? We've got this. We're here for it. like we want to we want to learn and we're like you know fingers crossed like maybe just maybe we're in for another shot. You know what happened? Yeah. We got another rejection email and still to this day I help killed them on [Music] Twitter. But at that point there was prey combinator which is a company that makes no revenue and now there's post a company that makes some revenue. Once we got back to the UK after California I did one thing which was only focus on growth. Like the only thing I had to do was make traffic higher than the day or the week before and make revenue higher than the day or the week before. It felt like every 4 to 6 months I was learning how to do a new job. And the skill set that really made it fly was SEO. I had to work out how to do marketing. Divide that. What What does that mean? Well, I have to choose what kind of marketing am I going to do. Because I had no money. It was only like SEO. Okay, how do you do SEO? We have to write landing pages. Well, I'm very dyslexic, but I'm going to have to work that out anyway, right? So, I'm just going to write all these terribly worded, you know, misspelled landing pages, which is a true story. I did. People search for things like trim video, crop video. There's actually about 500 of these search terms. So, I built a landing page for every single one of those things. And then I'd record YouTube videos for every single landing page. It was just brute force, like absolutely brute force. After that journey, things just started growing super fast. At that point, it was just like off to the races. 0 to 1 million in the first year. 4 months later 2 million. 2 months later 3 million and then 6 months after that it was 6 million. So it was 0 to 1 1 to 6. This like proper growth phase of the company going from 10 20 30 40 million in revenue. I don't know it was like a bit of a middle finger to all the people who didn't want to invest in me or YC turning me down. It was a bit of a hey, we're good. You know, like, you know, you're lost. The founding and the starting of the company is definitely like the most interesting part of the journey. And it becomes this like marathon. This is like an endurance sport, right? You're not on the roller coaster anymore. You're in like dayto-day combat. And I feel like at the start it's more like jumping through hoops, you know, and like trying to work out the next trick and how to get around that corner. And then once it starts going and scaling, it's more like how can I just keep drumming the beat of the company, you know, and keep keep things moving and keep growth up. And it's just really hard to run a business like dealing with people and like directing them and trying to do whatever you can that's like in the best interest of them, but also the company at the same time. Like it's genuinely really really challenging and the bigger you get, the harder it is and you only feel more and more vulnerable. I do anyway. I'm so paranoid all the time about the company, what we're doing. Are we doing the right things? I love it. I absolutely love it. I've got the best job in the world and I'm so so fortunate to be able to do it. But yeah, it's just tough. The company could have failed at so many points. It could have failed when the two interns quit. It could have failed when we ran out of money. It could have failed when we got kicked out of our office. It could have failed when we didn't get into YC, right? Like there is so many points where I could have been or we could have been like, "Nah, nah." Like, it's over. It obviously doesn't work. But every single time we kept going. And I'm so grateful for all of those learnings. so grateful. Thank you guys for watching. This was really fun to put together. Maybe one day Saba and Starter Story will be on Netflix. This story particularly hits home for me. And part of the reason why I wanted to create it was because I was rejected from YC three times. That also fueled me. And it's cool to see other people build huge multi-million dollar businesses that were also rejected. So if there's any lesson there, keep building, guys. Keep going. I'm going to put a link in the description if you want to check out Starter Story Build, which is our new boot camp where you'll come up with an idea, build it, ship it in 12 days using only AI tools. I think it's really cool. Okay, link is in the description for that. Otherwise, I'll see you guys in the next one. Peace.

TITLE: My Apps Make $4.5M/Year With $0 Marketing
VIDEO ID: vLLBzUZr6-s
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLLBzUZr6-s
================================================================================

My Shopify app, Kaching Bundles, is currently making me $4.5 million a year, and we spend almost zero dollars on marketing. How does this guy make over $4 million a year without spending thousands of dollars on marketing? Well, the answer is something you probably wouldn't expect. All of our growth is coming either from or Eric started his journey as a designer making just $2 an hour. Then he stumbled onto an opportunity that would change his life forever. I think there's still a lot of opportunity building in platforms and I'm personally researching. I spent over an hour talking to Aricos about all his different Shopify apps and how anybody can start building these things from scratch. And good news, he shared everything, including how to find platform specific ideas to build, how to run an async team with 90% margin, and the unique marketing strategy that helped him grow to $4.5 million a year in just two years. All right, let's get into it. I'm Pat Walls and this is Starter Story. Welcome, Ericos. Welcome to the channel. Tell me about who you are and what business that you built. Hi, guys. So, my name is Ericas. I'm from Lithuania, originally currently living in Paris. And I'm a designer turned entrepreneur building Shopify apps together with my co-founder. And we're currently at 4.5 million annual recurring revenue. What's really cool about our business is that we're 90% profitable. Okay. If you could give me a little bit of a breakdown of apps that you built. So, currently we have uh five apps in total. Our first app in the discount category was Kaching Bundles and we scaled it to around 400k monthly recurring revenue currently. Uh then we launched Kaching post purchase upsell. After that, we launched Kaching pop-up upsell and right now few weeks ago we launched Kaching uh card drawer upsell. All of these apps are in the discount category serving customers that want to increase their average order value within Shopify. Since our launch in 2022 August, we already made more than 400 million in additional revenue for all of the merchants that are using our apps. That's awesome. In building these businesses, what have you learned? What is the big opportunity on building apps on platforms? The thing I noticed about the app developers is that there's like solo developers, indie hackers, and I thought that they lack great user experience. All of their apps are kind of technical and a bit complex for for regular users. And the other type of apps was VCbacked or like huge corporations. The user experience were uh was great. But the problem about them was that they actually move pretty slow. If if there's a feature lacking, it would take probably months or or maybe even a year to launch something new. So that's how I kind of knew that there is an opportunity for me to be in that ecosystem and to try to beat all of those solid developers. I wasn't sure that I will be able to compete with high bigger companies backed up by VCs and so on. like a year or two years after doing Shopify apps, I realized that it's possible to compete with them as well. Okay, let's go a bit into your backstory here. What did you do before entrepreneurship and what got you into building stuff? Yeah, so right after finishing my school, I joined a local web design agency and I started working for $2 per hour. Since day one, I was always thinking, how can I 10x my earnings? And uh I quickly I realized that if I want to earn more I have to work like for myself. I I I have to start freelancing. So that's what I did in 2016 or 2015 I guess. 3 to 4 years later while I was still freelancing I was building products on the side. I had a client a startup who needed a landing page. So what I was doing I was just browsing the internet and looking for inspiration. And that's how I stumbled upon Shopify partners page. I bookmarked it and later on when I looked into it, I saw uh a section which said that top 25% Shopify app developers are making almost 300k a year. And in my eyes, it was like, oh my god, it's it's huge because what I was making with my freelance work was was much less. Having all of the experience in Shopify, I knew how how those apps were and that's how I realized that I have to build something myself in the ecosystem. Cool. Okay. The Shopify app opportunity. How did you find this idea? And generally, how do you think about finding ideas? When I was thinking of what do I want to build in the Shopify app marketplace, I I already had three main criteria. So, first one was it has to be pretty easy to build. I have to build it in like couple of months, no more than that. The second criteria was pretty broad market. I wanted to build something that could be useful for any Shopify store because it would be a lot easier to market it and I could use all of my clients that use Shopify and so on. The first criteria was I needed low competition. So that's my main my main setup how how I differentiate good ideas versus bad ideas. Nice. So on the topic of uh good ideas and bad ideas, let's talk about validation. How do you know when your idea is validated and what has that looked like for your apps before? Before building it, I tried to validate it with basically talking to users. You know, I joined various Discord communities of drop shippers. I joined e-commerce Facebook groups. I posted various Facebook posts in in those groups. And one of the posts where I I had a screenshot of my not yet published app. It was just a design and it kind of blew up. There was more than 100 likes and a lot of comments asking you know where can I don't download this app because they thought that it's already live. So that was my first validation that this product is needed and and yeah it it could be successful. If you can build a landing page or something to try get uh get the emails of your customers, that's great. If you can even charge for it, maybe make a pre-order or something, that's that's even better because you already know that people will pay money for it. All right, I got to stop you real quick and zoom out. Ericos built an insane business, 4 million a year on top of the Shopify app store without spending any money on ads. And that's maybe the secret, building on top of a marketplace. You don't need a big audience. You don't need to spend money on ads. And there's a built-in customer base just waiting for you to solve their problems. The only problem with that is that Shopify's developer ecosystem is, I'll admit, pretty mature. In other words, that means there's a good amount of competition on the platform. So, that begs the question, what's the next Shopify? What's the under the radar marketplace where I think developers should be building right now? Well, one place I think is interesting is the monday.com marketplace. We partnered with them on this video because they're putting real energy behind expanding the marketplace, investing in the platform, supporting developers, and actively looking for more builders to help meet their growing customer demand.

I'm stoked that we got to partner with monday.com in this video because Aeros is an example of what happens when you build on a marketplace. All right, let's get back to the interview. You're a designer, not a developer. How do you go about actually building these products? What's your process to go from zero to one with a new idea? Yeah. So, when I'm when I'm designing things, the first thing I look into is competitors. If there's already competitors in space, uh that's a good thing because you can dig into deeper and and see how they do like see their user experience. just go through it and I'm taking notes what I really like about it and what I dislike about it. And after that I I have a clear image of how my app could look like so that I could fairly say that it's objectively better than my competitors. And to make uh my chance for success higher, I have to find a co-founder. I think finding a co-founder is is pretty much similar to doing sales because you have to sell someone an idea that you can make a successful business and you just need their help. That's what I was trying to do. You know, I went into a local developer group in Facebook. I made a huge post. I and I mentioned that, you know, first of all, I have Shopify experience. Second, I'm a great designer with years of experience. So I can provide a great user experience which will increase our chance for success. Third, I have all of those clients already using Shopify which we can sell our Shopify app to. And with all of those things, you know, I think I'm increasing my chance for for finding a right fit. And and that's basically h how I found my co-founder. Let's go to the next section here. I want to talk about marketing. Uh, how do you go from Shopify app to real users and real paying customers? When you are just a new app, you have zero users, you have nothing. You're right at the bottom of the app store listings. So, I knew that we need to onboard as many users as we can manually. So, yeah, I just I just went to all of the communities. I just went to all of my clients, all of my friends that are using Shopify and asked them to install our app and try it for themselves. I made the app free and this way you can get more installs and of course more installs then convert to to more reviews and of course it drives more revenue then and it helps you know to improve your product further because you get all of this feedback. Okay, I want to dive into some of the dirty details about this reviews thing because I think that this is it's simple. It sounds simple, but it's actually genius. So, let's go a little bit deeper into the customer support and review strategy that really did change your business. Yeah. So, once we said that it's crucial for us to get those five-star reviews, we optimized all of our processes towards it. So first of all our product within our product you straight away we just ask for then we have all of these uh monthly emails. So every month we're sending a monthly email in which we uh show how much revenue this app brought to you and in that email we also ask for review. I think around 95% of our reviews for for our apps come from customer support. Our customer support is is topnotch. All of our customer support agents are really technical. So they can dig into your code and and fix things. And yeah, we provide 24/7 customer support right now. Nice. And now that you have a team, you realize still how important this is. And I realize that you have like a little bit of a system that where you gamified reviews. Can you talk more about that? So, recently I introduced a gamified bonus system to our customer support team and right now we're tracking who gets uh more reviews. We have the monthly leaderboard and uh we we have all of these different raffles and actually my favorite B bonus is uh a persuader of the month and what we do is we basically calculate the conversion rate of how many uh times you ask for a review and how many reviews you get and I think it really helps uh those agents bring more reviews and of course incentivizes them because they get bonuses for for each review. Cool. Okay. Okay. Well, let's dive a little bit into monetization, pricing, and conversion. How did you make the first dollar with cashing apps? And how did you get those first users? When we got our initial reviews, when we started ranking for for specific keywords, uh that's when we introduced our monetization, we introduced a subscription model. Uh later on, we introduced some tiers. So, like the more you use our product, the the the higher price you pay. Nice. And is there a kind of a strategy that you think about now? Every time you go to launch a new app, I always launch it for free because it reduces friction of installs and as soon as I start getting organic installs, I grandfather all of the users that already using uh our app so that they wouldn't need to pay and I monetize only the new users. And yeah, we always uh offer free trial. That that also helps. And we offer full refunds, no question asked because I think the risk of getting onestar review is is is just is just too big. That that was awesome. Uh next question is let's talk about tech stack. Uh what kind of tools or languages do you use to build and run this business? Yeah. So languages wise I I will not tell much because I'm I'm not technical but uh in our organization we primarily use Slack for for our communication. Then for our customer support we use intercom. Then we use uh features.vote for gathering feature uh suggestions. So every user can go to that board and suggest a feature or just upvote for other features that they think that we need to implement. Another tool that we're using is linear. Uh so we we use it internally for our task management. Last but not least, we use Mantle. You have everything Shopify related there. You you can set up affiliate partnerships. Uh you you can see all of the metrics uh all of the funnels uh customer management and so on. Since day one, our uh profitability was around 90%. expenses wise, we we always try to stay very very lean and and I hope we will stay lean in the future as well. Cool. That's amazing. Let's move on to the next question. More the lifestyle side of things. Can you give me what the day in the life looks like for you, a Shopify app developer making millions of dollars per year. Uh what does your typical day look like? Yeah, so I get up whenever I get up. I I don't set any alarms. Uh, I check my emails uh while still in bed. I I scroll some Twitter like probably everyone else in the world. When I have my to-do list, I always try to diff differentiate like quick wins, something that I can do in like up to 30 minutes. And all of the other stuff is is is the harder stuff that that I focus on later on. I I love the lifestyle. I I love what I do. And I don't feel like working. I I feel like I'm doing something. I'm really passionate about which which really helps because I'm you know I'm not counting time at all. That's awesome. Last question that we always ask uh all founders on the starter story channel. What advice would you give to someone looking to start their own business and start their own thing online? So I think that at start two people are are enough. You just have a designer who does all all of the product stuff. you have a tech guy and and you're good to go because you will be doing all of the customer support yourself to know that uh what your clients are struggling with. And yeah, once you start getting more tickets and once you start growing and and and scaling your product, then you can start hiring customer support and then you can start, you know, scaling scaling your team. And uh yeah, another ad- advice I I could give is probably to hang around other people that are building because uh you know community is is really is really helping because you you get to know people you can learn from their mistakes and uh yeah maybe you can even you know find a co-founder in those communities and and so on. That's it. Thank you uh Ericos for coming on the channel. Sharing your business that makes millions 90% profit margin is amazing and I can't wait to see you hit 10 million and take it further. So thanks for coming on. Thanks for having me. Ericos is the perfect example about how a designer and a builder can turn a simple idea into thousands of dollars. But that came with knowing the right information. For him it was about Shopify and finding the right problem to solve. Well, imagine there was a place that gave you this. Problems to solve, blueprints for building, and the marketing strategies that turn simple ideas into million-dollar online businesses. That's what we have at Starter Story, a library of over 4,000 case studies and business idea breakdowns where you can access this all data backed by real entrepreneurs.

TITLE: I Locked Myself In A Room, Made 17 Apps, & Sold 2 for $265,000
VIDEO ID: zPijWd9uk-I
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPijWd9uk-I
================================================================================

I built and sold two apps for $265,000 after teaching myself to code in just two month this guy locked himself in a hotel room taught himself the code and started building and just two months after I launched my first time he started small but over the course of that year he built over 17 apps most of them failed except for a couple which he then sold for a combined quarter of a million so what did you do right I grew my apps from 0 to 7,000 of monthly recing Revenue with Facebook ads when everyone say it wouldn't work but what's even cooler is the secret he learned along the way on how to quickly monetize these ideas I sat down with Nico for a couple hours and got all the sauce and in this video you'll learn exactly how he taught himself to code and build apps how to sell your app the right way and a full breakdown of his special secret paid ads sit down strap in and let's go I'm that walls and this is starter story all right welcome Nico to starter story thanks for coming on can you tell me a little bit about yourself and what you built my name is niik I've built 17 apps in a year and I sold two of them for 265,000 USD the first one is me logo. which generated $26,000 of Sales Plus I sold it for $65,000 so that's around $85,000 in total revenue from this project alone the next next one I did was to notes we generated $77,000 of sales before I sold it for2 200,000 last Julie I'd love to get a further breakdown of the two apps that you built that you sold for a combined quarter of a million dollars so make logo with an app to generate logo using AI the business model was just onetime payment so you can select a pack of logos so there was option for like five 10 or 15 options and then you had a few options to customize it so for example add some uh text next to it or just change position Etc I started working on it I think in I think November the transaction was closed in March so that would be around like 6 months most of the customers were people who were just curious about AI in general but I also had lots of small entrepreneurs who didn't necessarily wanted to pay a designer for a full logo but still didn't want it to have like something super generic the next one I did was Tor notes Tor notes is an app that helps you turn any kind of voice note you can record into proper formatted text in terms of pricing I started with onetime payments it was like a one-ear pass and eventually I switched to subscription which was 60 year or $12 per months in terms of customers I think I had around 10,000 users for the app I had like different targets like people who often need to brainstorm IDs and write them down so they can remember it later let's go into what got you building online give us a timeline of going from working for someone else to learning the code and making a living with your own projects I got started because I had a summer job in a bank and I really hated it so I resigned after 3 days I was 19 years old back then I think and I had like no clue what entrepreneurship was or what I was doing so I was just like trying things out after around one year I decided to create a brand of ties made in friends obviously didn't work out because no one is wearing TI anymore and I didn't have experience but it got me started into e-commerce and marketing which ended up with me learning about Drop Shipping on Facebook groups so I give it a try I didn't really got much success from it at first but I learned how to run ads on Facebook thanks to this I was hired as a freelancer for a Belgian closing brand eventually the owner of the brand I was working with told me that we would have to stop because he was going to work with someone cheaper at the same time my e-commerce brand wasn't working as well as I wanted it generated sales but very little profit so I decided to stop everything lock myself in a hotel room for 2 months and learn to code it was hard but after that after those two months I was able to make my very first step so it was was it at the end how did you find the ideas that ended up being successful and just generally how do you find ideas for that I have four main criteria the first one is the person value is that that something valuable to other people are they valuing solving this problem or is it just like a slight inconvenience that they don't really care about the second one is the scale uh is there like a market for that or is this like three people worldwide then the idea is not going to go far so I want to have something that people want and that many people want last two ones are more related to me so that would be my own skills so is that something that I can do myself and the last one is distribution so if there a way for me to reach user in a profitable way but I would say most of the successful ideas I had came to me like organically in a sense that I needed that for myself and I just made it all so let's talk about how you actually build products what's your step-by-step process to go from zero to one with a new idea so I us start by fixing a hard deadline if I don't have any constraint in time then there will always be something to add something to make you know the perfect app Etc and it forces me to only focus on whatever is necessary then the next step is the app prototype so that would be the very first interface to interact with the tech so I us start with like some kind of planning phase so that's where I write down all the features not the nice stuff only what is just essential once I plan all that I like to look for for example design IDs for the interface on dribble and Google image and recently VZ has been really useful to generate interface and then once I have lots of ideas and I have a better idea of how my interface is going to looks like then I either make like some kind of prototype on Sigma if that's a really complex user interface where I have to put lots of things together or I just do it directly by coding and improving on the B then the next step is to add like SAS layers so that's things like authentification payment like anything you need in know s that's typically the baller play code that you from from one project to the other once I have all that ready I go to the landing page part so this is going to be the sales page so just making a landing page that is as compelling as possible you know to make people want to either sign up or purchase the app or whatever is the goal of this project once I'm done with that I focus on optimization like optimizing for SEO Etc fixing like small issues that is any or optimizing for mobile etc etc okay so this is a lot of the build stuff tell me a little bit about the launch which is you know are there any either shortcuts or or kind of hacks that you found to be able to launch faster uh yeah for example for Mech logo AI I use tyo to get the information the name of the project uh some information and what kind of logo they wanted and collect the payment so I didn't had any backend at all it was not automated it's definitely not scalable but I was able to get something going and I got my first saes from that it's probably mean people are interested into that and now I can spend more time making a proper interface before we get into the marketing side of things I want to talk about something else first if you're building anything in B2B then you need to stop and watch this I talked to a lot of Founders in B2B behind the scenes about selling into Enterprise and just how much it changes their business imagine adding 100,000 in ARR per year from a single Customer because you landed a whale well that's what happen if you do Enterprise right but everyone in B2B knows that this comes with a huge headache making sure your app is compliant with sock 2 ISO 271 ISO 421 Hippa Etc if it's not you'll probably lose the sale waste a bunch of time and feel sad because you know just how much money you're leaving on the table well that's where vanta comes in and we've partnered with them because I think what they're doing is awesome Fanta is designed to get your startup compliant fast so you close those deals with confidence and not worry about the massive paperwork headache not only does vanta save you time it also saves you money this new IDC white paper found that vanta customers achieve $535,000 a year in benefits and the platform pays for itself in just 3 months over 10,000 companies like ramp atlassian and pendo use vanta to manage risk improve Security in real time so if you're serious about getting compliant then I think you should definitely download this free suck to checklist it breaks down the process in the road ahead so you can land more Enterprise deals with far less headache just click the first link in the description to download it for free thank you to vanta for sponsoring this video I think what you guys are doing for Founders is awesome all right let's get back into it let's talk about marketing so we talked about how to build how to launch but the probably the hardest thing is marketing so have you gain thousands of users and made hundreds of thousands of dollars so it all depend on the project and the resources I have available for example for make logo I didn't had much saving so I didn't wanted to spend any kind of money on ads but the thing is I was the first to have like AI generated logo back then people were just naturally curious for to not it was a bit different I didn't start ads right at the start so I first tried to validate the ID organically and just from that I got 1, 500 Mr or something like that and once I got to this point I knew the ID had potential I I decided to start running ads and I didn't had still lot of resources in terms of creative so it was really basic uh static ads so it's just like an image with a headline Etc I ended up making then landing pages for specific audiences and ads for those audiences and that's where it really blew up for the marketing cost again it it really really depends on the project for to notes for example I was spending between 20 to $100 per day I mentioned this is really not much for ads but I also had limited resources to like both make creative and other customer support Etc so in my situation it wouldn't make sense to spend thousands per day back then well let's dive into that a little bit because uh you know a lot of the people we talk to on this channel make it through organic short form you know this sort of stuff this is really really cool that you did this with paid ads so can you just walk me through your paid ad strategy a little bit so it really depends on the platform for example you have search platforms like Google Etc so in this case that's more about giving people what they want at the right timing but you also have Interruption platforms where you show you ads while people are doing something else so for example on Facebook or Instagram they're just scrolling and in this case it's really all about catching the attention and making the user like want to learn more by you know washing the ad and then clicking on it I use both video and static ads depending on how much budget I have Etc I have one ad for talk noes that worked really well it's not really like a professional ad it's more something that you can find scrolling on your on your feet so if you look at the video it's not like professional studio or whatever it's just a guy that I paid and he was recording himself reading the scripts in his office so it looks really like organic it doesn't really looks like an ad people will naturally be more inclined to watch the ad and you know uh maybe click after that that's one of the thing that made this art works well and it also focus on the problem so the name of the app like do notes is not mentioned until way after in the app you just keep giving them reason to watch to watch to watch until the end of the ad where you have the call to action and it's like oh now if you have all those problems and you want to solution then have a look at this product for example Okay cool so I want to do a little section going over the sale process just talking about ac.com and the process of posting your idea on there I think that would be helpful you've got through the process two times to sell the app the first thing is obviously where are you going to list it for sale in my case I went for acquire. comom now they don't handle the transaction themselves so they just put you in touch with like the buyer Etc but then you have to make the wire like sort of on your own the important thing is to is to make sure that the listing is like a landing page so you really want to showcase your startup as like a product now for the negotiations it's better to entprise your startup to get buyers interested because the thing is there there is some like ego play so for example for M logo I think I got like 50,000 and maybe 55 or something then I got 65,000 paid over a year and then the last call of the day the guy was like okay I don't want to waste time like bidding against other buyers Etc so I'm going to offer you 65,000 cash but we need to finalize everything in the next two weeks I don't want to waste time can you tell me what kind of tools or languages you use to build these products and run your businesses I use n as my main Java Script framework I tried like different Frameworks but no is just much better on every aspect for me I also do use next UI that goes with it so it's like a library of components so that way I don't have to code like every little button and stuff like that I can just say Okay button here allowed me to code like three times faster so I don't have to remake everything obviously I use csor coding so what I did is I embed the documentation of N and noi compared to before when I was not using AI n Etc I just work like 10 times faster with just those three ones I use v0 a lot so you just say I want this interface and they just make it to you get the code so I just have to convert it into next then for SEO even if it's not my main like Channel I still try to do a little bit and hre is amazing for that to collect user feedback I I I use and I created it myself is feed feedback widget. it's just a way to like easily collect feedback and the last one I would say is h test it which is the one I created is to make AB testing and increase conversion rate or test different boardings etc etc let's talk about um day in the life you sold uh multiple asss for quarter million dollars what is your life like now what does a day in the life look like for ni so in terms of routine um right now I don't really have like a strict r routine like I wake up at 7:00 a.m. work in the morning and in the afternoon I either work if I have things to do or I just do like Hobbies play video games with my friend and stuff like that but when I have like a a really specific goal in mind and it's just about grinding then I just uh wake up at like between 5:30 or 6:00 a.m. just go to the gym and then I just work until 7 or 800 p.m. I move really really fast uh by using this mix of like try hard then rest a bit to assess and try to find what I work on next that's awesome okay the last question that we asked everyone on starter story is if you could stand on Nico's shoulder in that hotel room when you were just learning how to c what would you tell him what advice would you give yeah I I would say don't get emotionally attached to the products that's something I already had but yeah make technical prototypes quickly to solve the problem then go to talk to user as soon as possible another thing like don't try to make 100,000 or even like $10,000 for your first project if you haven't got any success yet just try to make your first dollar online first and forget about scalability or anything it's just uh compounding small winds but you need this first little wins to PCH the snowball until you get like a a bigger one at the end of the slope all right well that was awesome thank you Nico for coming on to starter story your journey is amazing 20 apps sold them for a quarter of a million living the dream in Bali so I'm excited for what you're going to do next and uh thanks for coming on and sharing everything thanks that was a pleasure so thank you for Nico for coming on I think your story is amazing I think if you watch this it might feel like Nico had some crazy formula for success but I really just don't think that's the case he got started shipped a crap ton of stuff and while doing that he eventually kind of stumbled on a couple of things that worked I see a lot of people waiting waiting for the right time to start sitting on the sidelines While others like Nico are just getting started playing around with all these AI tools and new markets and just shipping stuff every week if you're trying to do something similar well I have something special for you it's called the AI build accelerator and in 2 weeks you'll ideate build and ship a real life production app imagine what would happen if you started today imagine where you could be in 2 weeks if you're curious about doing this and actually building something then check out the link in the description if you want to learn more but this is only for people that are serious about actually building something I'd love to see you in there just click the first link in the description and let's build all right guys I'll see you in the next one peace

VIDEO ID: BeRKQkU5Ceo

================================================================================

I mean man my life has been so wild when I was 19 years old I was going off a big jump and I landed on my back shattered my spine and was paralyzed instantly that was literally Rock Bottom this is Ryan Chen a guy who let no obstacle stand in his way I worked in the organic chemistry lab then I worked at Hulu and then I think I found my true calling in just like being a builder being an entrepreneur so he went all in I cashed out my 401k to get like the first R&amp;D samples to pay for legal fees to form the company we're basically just living off of like credit card points and then using the company funds for just meals and just that was it after 4 years of grit the business finally worked we were at Skyhigh off Shark Tank the business was growing and I was like somebody's going to try to take this business away from us some lady sued us we we would have won if we got to court but getting us to court would have bankrupted us this is the story of how Ryan Chen and his best friend Kent built a $ 100 million Company by overcoming the odds welcome to starter story Ryan grew up in an immigrant family of entrepreneurs with a natural ambition to become more he started his childhood playing sports at an extremely high level National Kendo team cross country state champ but when he went to college his Ambitions to become an athlete took a turn when I was 19 I was at a friend's birthday party and I was going off a big jump out in Big Bear California and I over rotated on the jump and and I landed on my back instantly and literally my life changed in a split second and I basically spent 6 months in the hospital going through surgeries going back to school part-time and also part-time rehab and that was literally Rock Bottom in my own head I would I would go through scenarios where I'm going to be a burden I'm going to slow people down is this life worth living I was kind of you go down this like Spiral right and that was about a year two years of really depression and and figuring out what can I make of this situation so Ryan was really struggling to accept his new self but luckily he had some true friends by his side it took one of my best friends Marcus to me like hey like come on this trip with us we're road tripping from LA to Austin we're filming this documentary called No cameras allowed that was the first big trip I did with a group of friends after my accident and I think I was like one I yes I can travel two I felt like I was closed off before where I only wanted to talk to people who knew me versus like now I'm like this is who I am this is like what I represent and it was like this fundamental like mindset [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for me if oh I can do [Music] this the reason why I'm alive and and and well is because of the support system I've had and I I'm extremely grateful for having two parents that supported me sister all my friends and family that without pushing me they were just there one of my best friends said that hey man you're still the same guy but now you're just in the chair chilling and I think that perspective also was like oh I'm still the same person I just get from point A to point B in a wheelchair and sometimes I'm faster because wheels are pretty fast one of Ryan's biggest supporters was his college best friend and eventual business partner Kent I met him my first day uh freshman year in college so it was like one of those things that you you meet somebody and you click we bonded over video games and Super Smash and uh we just stayed friends we would go out to eat we'd go out to party we'd uh Bond over Fitness he was training like I think 6 hours a day at the time with both of them having a passion for Fitness the boys were constantly looking for ways to increase their performance during training I was training for the par Olympic team at the time Kent was training with the Olympic jeto team out in Japan and we were both very focused on Fitness at this point we were taking pills during training for Not Just Energy but for Focus especially and the pills were made in Kent's dorm room mixing powders racatan parasan for things like lucid dreaming different types of creatine and we've changed the formula so many times right like we hope that could be like the recipe that's like that secret formula recipe that people want not thinking much about it Kent and Ryan were experimenting with different pill formulas and getting different results then one day Ryan got an email that would end up sparking an idea I got this group on email for you know 50% off on scuba diving and I knew that Kent would be down and we were both in between graduation starting our first jobs and I was like hey do you want to get scuba certified and of course he said yes and so we're on this boat we meet all these really cool people getting scuba certified with us we didn't have the energy pills but even if we did I think sharing it with people you had just met would be like oh no I'm okay that was the aha moment of like what if we can make supplementation more accessible and approachable by putting these great ingredients instead of pill form into gum and mints and and that was that was our idea the seed was planted but Ryan and Kent couldn't Risk Everything to follow this dream so they had to go get real jobs so I started off as a financial analyst for Hulu Kent worked as a music producer for Sony Music we both just had this idea in the back of our heads like we want to launch neurog gun this is such a great idea but one we didn't have the funding to do and two no one taught us about how to start a company or how to build a business so we were both kind of just saving up some money and then putting that into the business of like starting some type of fund and I cashed out my 401k which I highly don't recommend people doing but that was the risk that we were willing to take it was just like a year of like R&amp;D trying to find a manufacturer that would even pick up our calls and take us seriously Ryan and Kent knew they had to follow their dream so they went all in spending all their savings on the initial research and development and a couple of samples and finally they got the product back we had all these different formulas and and I would sample them around to like all of my co-workers at Hulu so like my managers other people in the finance team my manager was like yo mother eer he was like I was up till 3:00 a.m. I couldn't sleep and I was like that's me I was like so the product works he was like yeah product works but I couldn't sleep cuz there was like you know he was just like so wired and and so I knew that we had something Ryan and Kent finally had something great but literally zerar to make another batch and Market it to customers with their backs against the wall the boys had one last desperate shot to make their dream come true crowdfunding we officially launched on Indiegogo Kent Luckley was a big redditor so he got the Reddit new ICS group to support and I think we hit like our goal like of 30k in like 3 or 4 days Time Magazine wrote an article saying like half native gum is now a thing and then we got invited to Dr Oz and all of a sudden we had a lot of people moms who watch Dr Oz buying the gum and it worked Ryan is proof that with a good idea and some attention you can start moving products and make money but

advantage of it while you can now back to Ryan's story after seeing some initial success in raising $30,000 from strangers on the internet Ryan and Kent knew it was time to truly get their hands dirty when we first launched we were working at Hulu and Sony Music respectively for Kent for like a year and a half the first 4,000 lb of gum was sitting in Kent's apartment we didn't have a warehouse like Kent's apartment in downtown La was the warehouse and we'd ship 4,000 lb of gum going to USPS every day in those moments we're like okay things are working it's like a slow grind and the first year I think we did like a little over 100k and then year two was like 750k and then we're like oh wait this is like this can be a real thing 2 years into the business the boys realize that nuro has outgrown Kent's apartment and they have a tough choice before them keep it as a side hustle or go all in I think Kent and I both trusted each other we knew that this product helped a lot of people and we had so much user feedback and we would see the number of repeat buyers and the percentage of repeat buyers as a percent of Revenue so we knew that we had some type of base and some type of adoption rate right so when we first left our jobs it felt very real when we no longer had a stable paycheck right we had to like survive off of like what we were making and like eat what you kill kind of per se year three year four I don't think we took any salary I I think we're basically just living off of like credit card points and then using the company funds for just meals and just that was it I was playing semi-professional poker to kind of make rent we had so many inventory challenges couldn't get the products in time we were sold out we weren't uncertain about freight cost raw ingredients we've had products that get stuck on the border that's like three four five six weeks out of border and then you're just losing money there's so many things that you go through in the business that are are not Glitz and glamour it's it's like a grind and and you're kind of in the trenches and at the end of the day it's like who do you want to go go into battle with and like I want to go into battle with my best friend because I trust him Ryan and Kent are struggling to get nuro to the point of a stable scalable business not just a startup they're desperately looking for a way to crack the code and then something crazy happens 2019 a group of investors were just like hey guys like you guys have such a great story you should tell this story at think Shark Tank would be a great way for you guys to tell the story they convinced us I didn't want to do it to be completely honest Kent was like we should do it like they're right it's great for marketing but it's really great to get an investment we got two offers that were like below what we were asking for and Kent and I just had this floor we're like we're just not going to go below this and we stuck to our guns the boys walked away from the sharks with no money in their pockets but little did they know the exposure and connections they just got would change their lives forever it's been like a step change right it's not just like linear or just hockey stick it's like you grow and then it's this and then there's another big milestone that you hit I think we had a big step change with Shark Tank the business was growing and I was like us some lady sued us for um a trademark we we would have won if we got to court but getting us to court would have bankrupted us and I reached out to investors friends and no one really was that helpful four years in thousands of hours of work poured into this business it was on the verge of bankruptcy but then Ryan remembered a guy named Daniel lubetsky one of the sharks from Shark Tank Hail Mary I DM Daniel leeski on Instagram and I said hey Daniel I don't know if you remember me but me and Kent were on Shark Tank you were our guest judge we loved you you mentioned that if I ever needed some advice I can reach out to you I really need your help on something and he messaged me back and I told him about this trademark lawsuit about this lady who is suing us he hopped on a phone call with us right away for 18 months consulted us defended us he was talking to his lawyers our lawyers their lawyers her he was like Hey listen like at the end of the day if you if this goes to court you know Ryan and Kent are going to win based on Merit and it's going to cost you a lot of money and it's going to cost me a lot of money because I'm going to back all their legal fees and Ken's like like you know she's worth like $300 million and Daniel OBET is like I'm worth 3 billion turns out not making a deal on Shark Tank didn't matter they made a friend that would save their business and with all the legal stuff cleared nuro went on a well-deserved growth hot streak you know we've been really fortunate with Organic earned media so like I said Shark Tank was huge for us we've had a lot of major celebrities kind of talk about our product organically Ashley Graham a lot of professional baseball players Steve Aoki is actually a huge neuro user Joe Rogan big fan of neuro he talks about it organically none of that's paid Andrew Schultz a lot of people just have been picking up nuro and just kind of talking about it so I think we're a top 10 Tik Tock shop brand we're continuing to go viral on different videos that people are repurposing from Joe Rogan mentioning us or Shark Tank or different videos that our teams are doing but it's just all kind of compounds and adds so I think like I said it's like years 1 through 5 is like the hardest part to get to that kind of inflection point it was until like year 7even where we're really taking like a very good salary and and and things started to click we are now doing almost $10 million a month one of the the things that we're really proud of is like we had employee satisfaction survey and I think we had like 96% satisfaction rate that's like my most proud stat this year despite the revenue like has been amazing it's just like to see the team engaged and to see the the organizations that we can help impact and donate to like good to good causes like it's been awesome I mean man my life has been so wild you know it's like obviously like no one expects to go through an accident I've gone through but then to be able to pick yourself up from Rock Bottom through the support of others it's surreal you know it's it's really wild and I asked my dad one time I was like Hey like how do you define success and and this was years after my injury my dad said that success is defined by how high you bounce back from Rock Bottom and that that really stuck with me cuz he was like you know you you hit rock bottom and you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bounce back higher than anybody could have imagined and so yeah I feel like I'm happier now than I was as an angsty teenager when I was like 18 19 and I think there's whenever there's like a door that closes I think there's like two more that open and I think it's just like about you just going through that door Ryan is proof that entrepreneurship is for everyone doesn't matter current situation or your current skills or your current income the truth is nothing will ever be perfect so you just have to start if you don't start then all the dreams you have in your head will have a 0% chance of coming to life I hope you guys are all inspired after watching Ryan's story and I hope it's enough for you to just take that one step of action today and if

TITLE: He Made $10M with 3 iPhone Apps
VIDEO ID: 5u9u8yzPEpA
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u9u8yzPEpA
================================================================================

I taught myself to code with chat GPT and my apps have made over $10 million to date how did this guy make over $10 million with three iPhone apps after learning how to code less than 2 years ago well two letters AI now with the Advent of chat GPT and the popularization of AI there's so many different problems that you can solve either in different ways or a decreased cost in order to solve it I spent over an hour talking to Blake to figure out the truth behind how we actually built these million dooll AI apps and how other builders can take advantage of the same opportunity and he shares it all including his process for finding million dooll AI ideas and validating them his blueprint for building an app from scratch as a complete beginner and the marketing strategy that is making him Millions Tik Tok and Instagram are very solvable right now you can figure out the various influencer strategies to funnel millions of people to your product now let's get into the details I'm Pat walls and this is starter [Music] story welcome man it's nice to have you tell us about who you are and what you built yeah absolutely my name is Blake Anderson in one year I taught myself how to code with AI the first app that I built was called Riz GPT it's at 2 and2 million in annual revenue the second app that I built was called umax once again came up with the idea designed and built the application and led the majority of the marketing in the past year we've done almost $5 million in Revenue then the third app that I co-founded was called CI this one I also came up with the idea for though I did not build the actual application I helped with the designs but I have two amazing co-founders that lead operations on that CI uh was launched about 6 months ago and is now doing over a million dollars in Revenue per month okay so you built not one but three successful AI apps that are doing almost $20 million per year tell me about this opportunity in apps right now okay this is a great question there are two primary reasons that apps are so lucrative right now the first is the Advent of chat GPT and the either in different ways or at a decreased cost in order to to solve it with Riz GPT it would have been virtually impossible to build a AI dating assistant without the use of llms and number two is novel distribution techniques Tik Tok and Instagram are out the various influencer strategies the user generated content strategies organic account growth strategies to products and I don't think that the algorithms were as optimized for new accounts to be be able to generate millions of views a few years ago but now that they're all in bloodbath competition with one another they have to incentivize new creators and so they'll push more views to new accounts than they did previously all right so essentially apps have become way easier to build and Market recently which is why they're a great business to start for anyone that's watching this right now but let's go back I want you to actually share the story of how you got started with this whole thing I've always been fascinated by entrepreneurship always hustl throughout childhood figuring out new ways to make money mowing lawns raking leaves shoveling Drive waves then in high school I was still hustling like I built an ethereum mining machine back in 2016 or 2017 scaled Instagram meme pages but to be honest I drank way too much alcohol did too many drugs really just prioritized like partying and living a relatively degenerate lifestyle after college so senior year I'm graduating all of my friends have great jobs in New York City making six figures and I had nothing you know I had moved back home family isn't doing well financially house is going up on the market my older brother is giving me loans for groceries I was like okay I got to figure something out I do not want to get a full-time job and I set a goal for myself right as I graduated college I was like over the course of the next 12 months I will figure out a way to make $50,000 on my own all right so you're back at your parents house borrowing money from from your brother to buy groceries but you set this crazy goal for yourself to make $50,000 over the next year I suppose this is where your first app Riz gbt comes into play right how do you get started with it yeah we had friends that would send in fraternity group chats or whatever group chats with guys saying like what should I say to this girl and we figured that we could build an app to help people respond to girls I taught myself to code with chat gbt in the month of uh May June 2023 and then we launched in July of 2023 the first version of the app was so bad I built this myself we didn't have notifications we didn't have reviews The Design was a mess the pay wall was terrible and the first few promos go out and it doesn't really do anything few downloads we're making a few bucks and then I find these two underground kind of undiscovered creators I pay them each $50 for promo so $100 total and overnight 5 10 million views total 45,000 downloads in that first big day 200,000 downloads on that week 500,000 downloads on the month we're at 80k Mr from the jump that's pretty much all profit we ended up scaling it to a little bit over 250k Mr and then it kind of dropped down in plateaued to like 150 to 200k Mr consistently and that's where it's at Now Blake is proof that you don't need the perfect app or website to start making thousands of dollars off an idea all you need is an an MVP in a smart marketing strategy but you also need to make sure that you're working on a solid idea that's why I created the starter story Academy a place that helps you find an idea validate the idea with real feedback and shows you how to execute on that idea so you can get those first users so if you're curious about building a software product like Blake and hundreds of other Founders just like him head to the first link in the description to check out the academy now back to the video all right Blake you're story is insane mobile apps totally change your life yeah now let's talk about how our viewers could do something similar everything starts with an idea right what do you think are some of the mobile app ideas that could be turned into millions of dollars right now yeah number one I think that there are a lot of fragmented tools it's like AI LinkedIn image generator or like AI resume analysis but I think that there's massive opportunity to build a career AI style platform where you roll up all these tools into one platform and brand it as like if you're a student and you want to get a job this is the platform to help you do so uh and you could build that in a mobile app as well as a web app next up language learning the chat gbt advanced voice mode it's pretty incredible it's like actually a personal tutor Duolingo is making $33 million a month multiply that by 12 and we get like $400 million per year you capture 1% of that market and you have a $4 million annual application on your hands that's crazy honestly to me it seems like you're the type of person that never runs out of ideas no matter how many things you build so let's talk about that what are your methods for finding winning ideas I've used honestly different methods of finding the idea for each app that I've worked on with Riz GPT it was very clear problem that I had observed with people that I know people don't know what to say on dating apps and you build an app to solve it umax on the other hand was identified a little bit more opportunistically when people want to become more attractive they're willing to spend money on it they were spending money on skin care Hair Care Gua Sha the whole nine yards but there didn't exist any software to solve the problem that people were having when you find a niche that's heavily monetized with physical products that's a good indicator that the niche converts it's also a good indicator that you can probably build a software or application to solve a problem within it I think that there's still a lot of room for like an all-in-one AI glowup applic umax was kind of like the first iteration but if someone were to put real time investment into building a super valuable application here that really helps people improve I think that there's still uh millions and millions on the table there all right man thank you for sharing that now that we have not only the exact ideas that could be built right now but also your methods for coming up with more winning ideas do you have a specific process for validating these ideas my validation process primarily looks like a deep dive into the uh Niche on social media so what I'll do is I'll create an account say Cal and then purely consume nutrition and dieting and calorie counting weightlifting content essentially becoming the target market or Target demographic and then thinking about what it is that I want and then just build that okay gotcha putting yourself in your customer shoes is how you know they'll buy now let's talk about actually build the app what's amazing to me is how you're able to learn design coding and distribution in such a short amount of time and make millions with those skills if you were to restart from scratch today having nothing but the idea in mind how would you build it if I were to restart and build apps today here are the tools that I would use number one for design figma learning how to use figma will be one of the greatest unlocks in ensuring that the application that you put into the market is actually us now what I would recommend for anybody designing to do is to use references I'm grabbing different apps that have similar functionality and design to what I'm looking to build and then using that to inform kind of my design process right even if you yourself don't intend to be a designer you need to be able to work in figma to work with designers whether you hire them off upwork or work with someone internally number two when it comes to building what I would recommend is that you build in react native with the EXP Expo framework using cursor as your IDE then finally when it comes to marketing the two primary methods that I would recommend are influencer marketing and doing internal ugc so influencer marketing is when you find somebody that already has a platform or an audience and you pay them to promote your product internal ugc is where you or someone that you hire creates content based around your application and then post that to accounts branded around your application and if you are creating content yourself in the early days you're going to want to use cap cut to do so and you can do a combination of slideshows and faceless video content or content where you're speaking directly to the camera the most important note here when it comes to marketing is constant iteration be ruthless about how you iterate try out different strategies and as soon as you find something that is able to produce profitable returns for the company based on the time and or money investment you double down and double down and double down on that I want to double click into marketing because I see a lot of Founders struggling to get eyeballs on their products what are the mistakes that you see people making most when it comes to figuring out marketing yeah I think that where a lot of people get lost in marketing is they think okay I will just DM influencers and expect a response within 24 hours they'll DM 10 influencers and they get no responses they go oh this is so hard and I'm like no you're just you're not getting creative with with Riz GPT the Creator is making the most profitable content most of them were like 18 19 years old they're just doing it for fun and so getting in contact with him was really difficult I would find that one of them had a Discord link hidden in their Instagram bio or something and I would join that Discord and I would send a message every 10 minutes until the person responded there were guys that I was dming their mom saying hey get me a contact with your son I want to pay him money all right now let's talk about how to make money once you have those it balls how should people watching this right now actually monetize their app the primary monetization model for most apps is subscription everybody that I know that makes a lot of money on apps uses subscriptions generally I try to go with lower price points for a couple of reasons one I want as many people as possible to be able to use my applications people are more likely to tell their friends about it get generally more positive user sentiment on social media but then it also is more sustainable for long-term growth and you know a lot of apps charge significantly higher price points which leads me to the most important point which is you should use super wall super wall enables you to split test different offerings so different price points whether it's weekly yearly monthly at different points in the app being able to test these different offerings and different placements within the app can take you from making x per user that downloads to 1.5 or 2X awesome okay so far we've only talked about the positives of building apps but surely there are some pitfalls right what are the main expenses you have of running Ai mobile apps and how can people minimize them to stay profitable yeah so Apple charges 15% but for whatever reason it's really closer to 20% of Revenue up to your first million dollar in earnings beyond that Apple charges 30 but really Clos to like 33% one thing that people significantly overestimate is like the cost of AI in the back end unless you're doing image generation or using advanced voice mode AI costs are sub 3% the bulk of the expenses are usually attributable to marketing and staff if you're doing that content creation yourself you can do it on your own but one of the reasons that internal ugc is great is that you usually see somewhere around like 50 to 80% profit margins people doing influencer marketing you usually see somewhere in the range of like 25 to 70% and then people doing paid ads you generally see like 0 to 30% so in-house organic content might be the way to go if you don't want to spend all your profits on marketing and on that same topic are you comfortable sharing your profit margins so after influencer marketing after Apple's cut after server processing that sort of thing Riz GPT I don't think I can talk about unfortunately cuz it's run by my other co-founders umax does a little bit over $100,000 profit a month consistently used to do more k I uh does a few hundred th000 in profit a month okay another sensitive question sorry about it but I'm just curious what made you leave the Riz GPT team left because one of my co-founders and I were constantly going head-to-head about like who's at the Helm of the company essentially what I said to him was like okay we can't work together anymore either you run the company and I keep my Equity or I run the company and you keep your equity and he wanted to continue running it which I was like great I'm going to go work on new projects all right thanks for being transparent about that now I'm going to go a bit easier on you let's talk about technology what's the tech stack honestly my stack looks like figma cursor cap cut Mercury for banking that's actually pretty big Mercury is the best platform for startup banking in the US upwork for occasional contracted work one upwork method I would recommend for anyone considering hiring off of there hire like five to 10 guys to do an hour or two of work and then stick with the best guy that tends to work very well coding languages react native and no JS yeah pretty pretty straightforward nothing special all right man let's talk about some personal stuff what are you up to these days I've always been so passionate about self-improvement about doing everything one can in order to improve their health to become more successful and find more purpose in their life and so that's why I set off to build what I'm currently working on which is Apex which I describe as is an all-in-one self-improvement ecosystem where we're starting to create content build a free community build free mobile apps to help people and sell low margin highquality physical products it's something that I'm very excited for and passionate about and I wake up every morning just like so amped to work on it it's going well we started this a little bit over a month and a half ago hell yeah man that's exciting I think it's awesome to be able to wake up every day and work on something that you're actually passionate about another question I want to ask you is what's the biggest lesson that you've learned in your entire Journey arguably the biggest one is creating a sense of urgency I found that my most productive and successful periods have come when there's a lot of risk and a lot of urgency to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done quickly so when I was building Riz GPT it was like I'm at home making 0 while my parents house is on the market meanwhile all of my friends are making these great sixf figure salaries living up Life After College and I felt like I had a fire under my ass to get something done and to begin succeeding when I was building UMX I had obviously just split from my previous team and I felt like I had something to prove I was on my brother's couch I spent Thanksgiving alone I had some sliced turkey while I was coding and now with Apex everyone looks at me and they're like dude you you did so well in the app space and now you're building what like you're making content you're trying to be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] influencer I feel that like I feel the pressure and it fires me up and if you feel like you have that for lack of a better word like you have that dog in you create a sense of urgency 100% agreed now the last question that I want to ask you we ask all founders that we interview on starter story what would you say to entrepreneurs we're just getting started yeah I think one of the things that has helped me most succeed is trying to abstract myself away from what you hear on social media and what others are telling you to do you have to be able to think on your own and think from first principles as opposed to constantly just doing what others say there's a naval quote that a friend recently reminded me of if you want to make the wrong decision ask everybody love it man well Blake I appreciate you coming on starter story and sharing all of this value I can't wait to see what you build next I'll be watching take care man cool appreciate you brother okay recapping this episode what I think made Blake so successful is how hard he went on content marketing I've done a lot of research on businesses and nearly every really really successful bootstrapped BC app like this purely got traction from content I think the most successful BC Founders or people building iPhone apps they truly understand that product is just not as important as distribution as distribution and attention wins the game if you want to win in BC especially if your app is not Niche it's like a calorie tracking app like this then you must be ready and excited for the content game you must already be thinking about what Tik toks you're going to try all the channels you can try and even validating your idea in the first place through content online before you even build something this is why I created the starter story Academy to not only have you focus on building an idea but most importantly figure out how to get attention on that idea how to get your first customers how to get feedback from the customers so you can build a better product that will resonate with thousands if not millions of users if you're serious about taking the first step then definitely check out the starter story Academy just head to the first link in the description if you want to learn more much love and I'll see you guys in the next one peace

TITLE: How I Built It: $37K/Month Notion App
VIDEO ID: WuzxmeUP6ro
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuzxmeUP6ro
================================================================================

I just spent 6 days working on it creating like a small MVP and now we are close to 37k of monthly working Revenue how does this guy make over $400,000 a year with an app he built in just 6 days Well turns out he really knows how to find customers obviously there is which is always a big one for this kind of products I was able to get quite a lot of users pretty fast thanks to this Julian Nom started his journey while working a 9 to-5 as a software engineer I was commuting 3 hours day I was spending all of this commute time on my computer working on the side projects after years of experimenting with different side projects Julian finally found an idea that worked and now he's a solopreneur making a doctor's salary while working on multiple passion projects so I gave Julian a call to ask him exactly how he did it and how anyone else can do something similar luckily he shared a ton of good stuff how to find and validate ideas the best places to Market a new product and the viral Loop strategy that got Julian to over $400,000 a year all right let's get into it I'm Pat walls and this is starter [Music] story all right welcome Julian it's nice to have you tell me a little about who you are and what you built okay I'm Julian I'm 28 I'm the founder of not forms which is a form builder for notion users we have close to 100K registered users and now we are close to 37k of monthly working of you got it can you tell us a little bit more about the story of how you found the idea for note forms yeah definitely I was a notion user for maybe two or 3 years I really love the product and one day notion finally released their IPI which meant that anyone could build Integrations and product one notion and I just decided to copy a feature that another database like product named air table had which were forms so you know I just spent 6 days working on it creating like a small MVP timeing was important uh and it really helped going the project it's fine to start small as soon as you get some users and some feedback you're able to iterate much faster and to focus on the you know core value of whatever you're building so you built your SAS around an already existing platform notion why do you like this approach better than doing a traditional Standalone SAS building a one platform is easier you don't have to build the community around it you can kind of cannibalize part of it and try to solve a sub issue which is kind of what I did with not forms right notion already had a huge Community people were really fan of the products they had like a huge sub rect tons of Facebook group of course it comes with its own set of issues you have the platform risk but I think finding this kind of platforms it's really a good way to to start okay so you've already built a couple profitable projects now are there any other methods you have to finding winning ideas yeah I think the easiest way to to find ideas is try to solve your own problems if you're your own user then it's definitely easier to build a great product if you use it you get to see the flows and the issues and improve on them the drawback of this is that sometimes you can have a problem and think it's great to build a tool for this but then you realize you're the only person with that problem because of that I think it's important to ship fast and try and put it in front of other people to get some feedback early other ways to get some ideas I guess is just to be curious talk to people for instance I really love you know with my friends that have totally different career paths and talk about like the way they work their process their daily lives and it's always amazing to me uh with a technical background to hear that you know sometimes they spend one two 3 hours every day doing something that could easily be automated also being on social medias like Twitter I think is really a great way you hear about new tech you hear about New Opportunities you discover new things that later you can apply to new problems I think that's also a great way all right so once you have an idea in mind what's your process for validating the idea and know that it's something that's actually worth building yeah so my way of doing things is just to actually build a product or at least an MVP for it and then share it to as many people as I can and get instantly some feedback from the users focusing on a project for a small short amount of time really helps you get a sense of whether this is valuable or not of course it's hard to apply to many projects you know like there are things that you cannot just build in one week as as I'm a solopreneur you know like I try to avoid this and focus on things that I can build by myself and quickly the more you build I think the faster it is to build now you know like every time I'm starting a new project I can just copy the code base from the previous project keep all the UI and that kind of things and I can just focus on the core logic and the value that I want to bring to the users so you get faster every time my favorite part about Julian's story is he was building side projects while he kept his full-time job and just like Julian I actually did this same thing I started a million-dollar business while I was working in 9 to5 and it wasn't easy it required working on the right idea getting tons of feedback and actually figuring out how to monetize so I could replace my 9 to-5 income but the hardest part above all consistency actually showing up every day and doing the work that's why we created the academy it's a 5we program where you'll find an idea build it launch it validate it all while working just 2 hours a day it's the same framework I use to build a million-dollar business and it's what I've seen thousands of successful Founders actually use it's what actually works because it's all about taking action and actually building which is what I want to see you really take a shot at so if you're curious about building a profitable side project like Julian and me and you still feel like you don't have the time to work on it or work on your ideas well head to the first link in the description if you want to learn more okay so you believe in shipping fast fast but do you have any Frameworks on how to build MVPs really quickly the best way of doing that as a technical person is to focus on the product and not on the technology I've been using the exact same stack for the past 10 years pretty much since I started coding I'm actually using PHP which a lot of developer likes to make fun of with this PHP framework called laravel and now I'm super pro efficient with it I have ton of you know small piece of code that can reuse from one project to the other and that really saves ton of time so yeah you can spend some times if you have fun learning about Technologies but if you want to build projects just do it as fast as you can use what you know and focus on that okay cool now let's talk about marketing yeah how did you get users for your app and what are the best places right now for people to find customers I published the projects and then I just spammed all the notion related communities I could find online obviously there is Reddit which is always a big one for this kind of products usually they have you know like a subreddit dedicated to it people that are really fond of the product so they're curious about discovering new things around it usually people on Reddit and and these kind of communities that really don't like people putting links there trying to get some new users but because it was so new and because the product was entirely free there there's not even monetization in it I feel like they were kind of okay with me doing that and that really helped you know like I was able to get quite a lot of users pretty fast thanks to this but also another platform I found to be super useful our Facebook groups there are many people using Facebook and Facebook groups are super alive there are Facebook groups for everything like for your C for sports for apps for whatever and that was super useful as well Twitter I mean is great the only thing with Twitter is there is a cold start issue when you start twitting you're basically on your own something really important into getting started on Twitter is to find the people that you relate to so the people that inspire you and to try and interact with them genu with times they're going to start you know recognizing your face they will interact with you as well you gain some more followers and you know that's how you get started product I think is a nice way of advertising your product but I think it's a bit overrated I see some people spending weeks preparing for product launch while in the end you just get a bit of traffic a nice backlink and that's pretty much it like when I did the launch for not forms I got you know like of course more eyes on the products but I think I didn't get a single sale from the from the launch you know that's my experience with it I see okay tell us now about your special growth strategy and how someone can implement it in their business to get more users today as people starting using it they were building forms with notion forms and they were sharing the forms because you know that's the purpose of a form Builder you build a form and then you share it you embed it on your website and because of this people that are supposed to F the form they get to see what you built it's easy for you to just add a link back to your product or do some kind of advertisement and that becomes viral because the more users you have the more people see your product and then the more users you have so I think if you have a product for almost every product you can find a way of incentivizing your users to share your product or piece of your product so it could be you know just a small widget that you can put on your website that's exactly what does product hunt by the way you know like they give you this little badge to say hey I was product of the day and then you put this on your website and then it's a it's a back Ling for product so if you can find a smart way of doing this or make it valuable for your users to share what they did on your platform then you can create a viral Loop and I think that's super important to try and build something like this awesome but with all these users coming in how do you manage customer support or all these customer inquiries so for the first year working on it I was entirely alone on the project so I was doing everything myself I was receiving messages like all the time at night so sometimes I would forget you know to turn off notifications and then it would wake me up later on I I hired someone to to help me with this and that was really relief but that being said I really don't regret uh doing this that way it really helped me build a better products understand the user needs but also identify issues within the product so even today we still have the operator you like an agent that's working with me that's uh always on it and we also have an AI chat bot that we train you know on all the product docks and and all the past conversations and really incentivize people to talk to us so within the product we have tons of button you know they can click to report a bug leave us some feedback suggest a feature or just you know like talk to us really since the beginning I've only Built what people ask me to build nice so actively talking to customers is how you actually find the features to add let's now talk about monetization how did you start making money from note forms how did you make your first dollar yeah it's starting taking off slowly I think at some point I which th000 users I had tons of feature requests all of these features that I was adding I was adding you know a little Pro tag and when you clicked on it it says ahey this is free for now because it's the beta but whenever it will launch it will become a paid feature and then one day I built all the subscription system and I just flipped the switch and I told all the users hey now this part of the product is paid since you were there since the beginning here's a 4% discount code that you can use uh for life and it was a long day I remember I was just you know like refreshing the STP page to try and get a a new subscription but nothing came and then later during the night one guy took a a yearly subscription even and I was so happy like I made $90 and then the day after maybe I got two and then three and then I didn't get any subscription for like 3 days started to panic and then I got another one and just went on from there okay now let's talk about pricing how did you decide on the pricing for your product yeah pricing is super hard you don't want to be too expensive but of course you want to make as much money as you can so I didn't know what to do so I just looked at all the for Builders out there and I thought you know hey like this is a new product I have one10 of all the features they offer so I need to be cheaper than all of them and then over time I just experimented a bit I tried you know increasing the price slightly I saw that it didn't really have any impact on the conversion so I did it again and then later on I also added some more expensive plans that also helped you know increasing a bit the revenue and further let's talk about business model how did you choose between a one-time payment and a subscription if it makes sense for a product to have a subscription then it's definitely a good idea because getting recing revenue is amazing because you can you know acquire customer and then for the next X months you will get money for it and I found that selling something for $50 per month is much easier than selling one thing for $500 one time okay let's talk about AI are you currently using it in your business overall I'm super excited about it there was very recently hype about um a new developer tool called cursor which is kind of an AI P IDE and I recently started using it and honestly I'm I'm amazed and it's literally like speeding up by maybe two uh my work nowadays with all the content you can find online with tools like AI I think it's easier than ever to build a product on your own and you know to start working on something so that's amazing and I'm so glad you know I'm living in this period of time because there are just so many possibilities and I'm super excited about all of this okay that's awesome on the topic of technology what are some other software tools you're using to profitably run your business for the Tex tack so the back end framework is a PHP framework named laravel the front end is built with a view framework name next it's all the pages and make sure that everything loads fast the database is post gr SQL we host everything on AWS so of course you know since I work there for a bit it's just easier for me that way now we Ed for subscription billing we use amplitude to track product analytics you know like the user behavior on the platform what they use that kind of things we use crisp for the support chat we use Sentry you know to track uh the errors that happens on the app so that we can you know like learn about them and fix them we use a product called feature base for a road map like a public road map where people can see you know what's going to be built next and of course feature request and Bug reports with three people fulltime and one person that's parttime so the total salary for them is 5K so that excludes me then there is 1K that we pay for servers and all the SAS tools that I mentioned earlier we spend around 3K per month on ads uh so we only do Google ads mostly because I don't know how to do anything else and then usually we spend probably like around 2K per month with random Freelancers so it could be you like UI designers copywriters Sometimes some external developers that kind of thing okay now last question that we ask all founders we interview if you could sit on younger Julian's shoulder and give him some advice when he was just starting out what would you say um Amazon has a set of leadership principles one of them is bios for action and I think that's a really good one the most important thing you can do is start if you spend too much time thinking about it and not doing anything that at some point you'll just get demotivated and and nothing's going to happen the Project's going to die but as soon as you know you start working on it and you get you know to see the first results get the first users it really FS your motivation and of course it helps you shavee the product better because you get feedback and and so on so the first thing would definitely be launch as soon as you as you can don't overthink it don't build too many features just build a simple MVP and then put it in front of the eyes of your customers the other thing is not to be shy so that took me a bit of time as well but try to talk about it to as many people as you can you can only know if it's a good idea or if it's valuable or if it's actually useful uh by getting the opinion of other people no one is going to stop everything they do in their life just to build what you describe them right if that happens that means that you know one guy was more motivated than you by your own ID and that's on you right you should have done it in the end you're not risking that much I think if if if you know you can find a job especially like if you're software engineer six months off working on a project is is nothing the risk seems huge but I think it's not that big all right Julian thank you thanks for coming on and sharing your story I love the business that you built and wishing you luck in the future keep sharing your story awesome cool thanks man yo guys I really hope you all enjoyed the video and wrote down some good takeaways that Julian shared but I do want to say something real quick at the end of the day the point of these videos is to inspire you and show you how other people just like you found ideas and built them hopefully this inspires you to go out and do this thing on your own while learning is important taking action is the thing that's actually going to get you that dream outcome if you still feel like you're struggling to take action no matter what then I highly recommend you check out the starter story Academy it's a 5-we program where you'll come up with an idea you'll build it you'll launch it you'll validate it and you'll get it in front of customers what's even more amazing is you'll do this alongside hundreds of other people doing the same thing building something that will change their life and we will hold you accountable every single day to showing up and doing the work the academy is what I wish I had when I was getting started and I still had a full-time job and it's designed for you to actually build something that changes your life just head to the first link in the description and I'll give you a bunch of more info about it I hope to see you in there otherwise I'll see you in the next one peace

================================================================================

what if I just went for it this was the question I asked myself one summer for probably the 39th time it was a Sunday and I was about to get on a flight across the country I just spent the weekend drinking into Oblivion with my friends the whole week felt like a blur I was so hung over and like with every other hangover I began to ponder my life I couldn't stop thinking about how much I didn't want this living for the weekends dreading Mondays a life full of comfort yet devoid of any freedom I was nearly 30 years old already many years into my so-called career Successful by Society standards but something just didn't feel right you see as a kid I always had dreams I'd be different but as life went on those dreams they faded away and I found myself stuck behind a desk all thanks to a series of decisions I thought were in my best interest College the fancy job the big city these decisions did I make them for me or did I make them for everyone but me and whenever I found myself alone in the airport hung over like this these dreams would come back it was at this moment I found myself wondering what if I just went for it one year that's all I need what would happen if I chased my dreams for 365 days and that's when it all [Music] started in that moment I reached into my suitcase and pulled out the book I've been struggling to get through a book called Think and Grow Rich this book would eventually rewire my brain for success but for now I flip to my bookmark and read this whatever the mind can conceive and believe it can achieve a simple quote but I read it over and over and over if you want to change you must believe in that change you must visualize that change but what change did I want I wanted to be free of my student loan in credit card debt I wanted to work on things I was passionate about I wanted to be free but Dreams they're not enough you must create a detailed plan of action to achieve your goal so what would be my plan of action I will stop spending money on I'll dedicate nights and weekends to building my future I will start building a business I wrote all this down on a tiny little note card this was my Manifesto exactly what I want and exactly how I'll get there when I got home I nailed this little note card right above my bed and I read it over and over every night night and every evening until it was etched in my memory what should I even work on what am I actually passionate about and how can I actually make money from it these questions they paralyzed me they prevented me from ever actually getting started and that's when I realized I was obsessed with control I was obsessed with the idea of having it all figured out and this made me scared of committing to anything but really I was scared of failure but this Manifesto this little piece of paper right here it did one thing it forced me to get started and getting started even in the tiniest way taught me something that would change everything failure is success when I finally gave myself permission to fail it unlocked the answer I knew I wanted to build a business but what do I work on getting started was the first part but I quickly found myself trying to build things I had no business doing my first business idea lasted about 3 weeks until I realized I was building something because someone told me it could make money online I had no passion for the idea and no skills that would help me build it and that's when I went back to the drawing board and looked for an idea that only I could build something that aligned perfectly with my skills my passions and of course something that could actually make money within days I came up with the idea for starter story a platform where you could see how regular people like you and me built businesses that changed their lives exactly how they found their ideas exactly how they launched and exactly how they got customers this was the product that I knew and this was the product that only I could build so why not create it for the world I purchased the domain name I put together a plan I started building and everything started to click I realized that this idea it had been living in my head all along but my obsession with control my fear of failure prevented me from ever getting started on it but once I let go of that I was free I believe that everybody has a business idea just like this something that aligns perfectly with your skills your passions and of course something that can actually make money to prove it to you I'm running a free Workshop to show you exactly how you can do this too we'll hang out and talk about how to overcome that self-doubt how to find your million-dollar business idea and exactly how to execute on that idea on Just 2 hours a day just head to the first link in the description to save your seat spots are limited I'll see you in there ever heard the phrase people never change well I believe this is mostly true with one exception people do change when they changed their environment it's the reason people change when they leave their Hometown for the big city a new start I needed a new start I was trying to become this new person trying to actually build something but the problem was I was stuck in my old apartment in my old ways no execution no Focus no consistency and that's when I realized that was my problem it was my environment that's what I needed to change so I went looking for a new place a new environment where I could have a new start and I know it sounds so simple but that place was the Starbucks down the street this was the place where I transformed from someone who never did anything to someone who actually got done I started waking up every day at 6:00 a.m. and every day I walked into that Starbucks I became a new person this new environment this new me and this is when things really started to change I basically stopped drinking and spending all my money on the weekends I stopped spending every Sunday watching 12 hours of football and I started building this new future things started to happen really fast two months in I found my distribution Channel I went viral on Reddit and all a sudden I had an audience and an actual validated business model four months in I made my first dollar and landed the first sponsor of my newsletter 5 months in I started making internet founder friends and building a following on Twitter and meeting people from all across the world 8 months in I landed my first really big sponsorship deal for $112,000 I had never seen this amount of money hit my bank account at one time this is when I knew that I really had something people were willing to pay me money for something that I built from a Starbucks and a laptop and this blew my mind and 365 days later I had built a business to $3,500 a month from a laptop and a Starbucks while I had a full-time job I had made it I walked into work handed my resignation and quit my full-time job I was going to go all in on starter story this journey it didn't come without sacrifice yes I built this business but in the process I had to change into a different person I became so focused on actually making this thing work that I felt like I had to leave a part of my past behind I became more and more detached from my old friends and even my family I had to move from the city that I loved I even had to miss a good Friend's Wedding All For What and that was probably the hardest part in my darkest moments I laid awake wondering if this was all worth it am I being selfish to sacrifice everything in the name of chasing my dreams I knew I had to go on this journey but what would happen when I came back and I'm a new person my old friends my family would they accept the new me as I look back on the journey I can't stop thinking about that question what if I was never alone in that airport on that fateful day what if I never had that book in my suitcase yes the journey was full of sacrifice if I didn't push through those 365 days of change to change my habits to change my environment to change my identity what would have happened and even though I had to change as a person my friends my family they welcomed me back with open arms they were so happy for me I didn't realize it but they were actually along for the ride the whole time and that makes me so happy in those 365 days I built a business that changed my life I achieved that freedom that I had set out to get no boss no Mondays nobody can tell me what to do that doesn't mean that life is easier now because there's a whole new set of problems when you're in control but now I'm in the driver's seat and even more important I get to wake up every day and work on something that I'm so passionate about starter story so were those 365 days worth it who knows but I know one thing for sure I'll never have to ask myself the question what if I never went for it

================================================================================

best kept secret in business is this product right [Music] here what's up starter story my name is Pat I'm the founder of starter story and these are the essential tools I use to make over a million dollars a year this might not be as cool as GQ I'm just a regular guy but I wanted to show you just some of the my little chosis and random things that I use to make money online the first tool that I use is Loom I use loom for like everything anytime I was going to write an email or give someone feedback on something or delegate some sort of project or teach someone in my business how to do something or give them feedback I use it instead of writing an email I think the craziest story about Loom is uh my buddy Peter levels levels io on Twitter if you're not familiar I was telling him about some stuff that I've done with email marketing just recorded a quick 5minute loom video went over all of our clavio flows sent it off to him just think thinking nothing of it he comes back to me and he's like yo this is like the most valuable thing I've ever watched I think you could actually just like sell this loom video I created the strip payment link we put it online and it made $220,000 in one day just from pre-orders I didn't have to do anything it was just a 5 minute loom video became $20,000 in a day the most money i' probably ever seen a day of that P all right this is my my latest Obsession which is tea I'll let you guys know that I have a very addictive personality and a few years ago I found myself addicted to caffeine addicted to coffee I found myself having like five cups a day and then I found myself having panic attacks and anxiety where my whole body was tingling all the time and I thought that I had um cerebral paly and but I looked it up and it was just anxiety so a couple years ago uh me and my girlfriend decided to just quit coffee and switch to tea this is my new favorite thing and my favorite tea I just love the taste of it is Earl gry and it's actually really cheap basically you just get this tea right here and you get hot boiling water in here and then you just scoop some tea in there and this really isn't going to work because this isn't actually hot water right now but let's pretend that that's going to steep for a little bit and then after about 4 minutes I get my little cup and check this thing out this is um what is this thing called again a cup no this one oh but basically you take this you put it on top and it has this little magical little device right here where it just goes right through and then you have your tea right here put the cap back on and enjoy your tea all right what is this yellow thing this is my favorite book this is the book that changed my life it's called Deep work when I first started my business it was a side hustle I had a full-time job and obviously I had to pay the bills I had to go into work from you know 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and that left me with only a few hours left in the day to actually make progress and I found myself kind of scattered I had like Twitter open I had all these different things open and I wasn't getting anything done then I found this book and I learned about this idea of deep work which is basically distraction free work so I actually built my business while I had a full-time job by waking up early going to the Starbucks down the street locking in putting my headphones on putting my playlist on blocking all Sites blocking all distractions turning my phone off and just doing deep work actually coding writing delegating and doing like the hardest scariest things that I had to do to actually get a business launched while I had a full-time job after 365 days I built a business that made money and I was able to quit my job and it was really just that deep work showing up every day and actually making progress in this crazy distracted world that we live in and Shameless plug I believe in deep work so much that I've created a community around deep work inside the starter story Academy there are hundreds of people doing deep work right now logging their progress logging their deep workk hours building their idea getting feedback and actually launching their thing and changing their life if it's something that you think that you would be interested in trying out you can download our deep work checklist it's a full checklist on how to do the most effective deep work if you have a full-time job and how that can tie into actually building a business the link is in the description I'd love if you guys checked it out so this is a 16in MacBook Pro it's the perfect size if you know what I'm saying I think the 16in is perfect because it has like a big enough screen that you can not need an external Monitor and also it can fit in your backpack I I like it so that this is all that I need so that if I'm working from a coffee shop or I'm working from the airplane or I'm working from somewhere all the way across the world or if I'm just working in my house that I don't need anything I don't need a mouse I don't need a keyboard I don't need an external monitor I have my whole setup right here if Apple charged $20,000 for this I would still buy it I think it is the most it just blows my mind that you know in 2024 now that you can build a billion dooll business from one laptop in one idea do you remember the uh the video with Alex Goldberg I think his name was it was my laptop we were using for boll and they were talking talking about all the uh crumbs on his laptop in the comments I didn't see that was because when we flew there I ate one of those little you know those little uh gingerbread things that gave you on the flight and I've got crumbs all over it you've probably heard of this before this is Reddit one of the biggest websites in the world one of the biggest Platforms in the world one of the best ways to get the first customers for your startup I had created starter story I thought it was going to be this Mass success when I first created the website and then no one showed up right after a few months of trying to figure out how can I get customers I created one post on Reddit that essentially went viral and it wasn't even that Viral it got like 400 up votes or something like that but that led to like a thousand people that signed up for my email list and then led to like the first customers and the first audience building that I ever did the hard part about Reddit is redditors they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate spam they can smell your solicitation from a mile away my advice for anyone who's trying to get their first customer on Reddit or trying to just get their first customer in general is go to those subreddits sort by the top posts and look for posts that are kind of secretly showing off a startup you'll probably figure something out and don't give up on the first try either keep trying and eventually you'll get your first customer I know like a bunch of Founders we've interviewed some people here on starter story who through one Reddit post they changed their life they quit their job and they built a business that changed their lives woo I love that smell all right so what do we got here all right we got my favorite thing probably in the world which is tennis when you're building a business especially if you're doing something like a solopreneur you get so caught up in the online world and all the results and all the metrics that one of the best things I've done is found a hobby that can take me away from that for even just an hour or two per day I picked up tennis maybe four years ago when covid was happening you know before that I was doing a lot of running I was I ran a couple marathons I liked running but I would always kind of dread going for runs a little bit and when I started playing tennis I found myself wanting to get up early in the morning and go play and looking forward every single time for anybody that's struggling to get to the gym or work out my number one advice is to find something that's actually fun to do that doesn't feel like working out I've heard rock climbing is pretty good I've heard pickle ball and Tennis is the one for me who's your favorite tennis player jokovic Novak jokovic is my favorite tennis player because he's the black sheep nobody liked him he was the underdog and as you guys know I love the underdog this right here this is our pride and joy this is our 100,000 YouTube subscriber plaque in 2024 it doesn't matter what product you build it doesn't matter how good your product is it is about the distribution of your product YouTube is I think one of the best ways to do that because there's real people watching this right now real people behind the screen that actually you build a relationship with can change your life overnight by just creating a video how crazy is that so I think that's amazing I think that YouTube is the future like you just saw that Tom Brady and Cristiano Ronaldo created YouTube channels everybody wants to be on YouTube everybody wants to be a YouTuber now and it's definitely not too late so I think that YouTube is probably one of the most it's the most essential thing in starter stories business it has changed our business and I want to create more great content that you guys love and uh we'll see you at a million subscribers so tell me about your addiction this one's going to get dark by the way yeah good my name is Pat and I'm a nicotin holic this is Zen these are pouches of nicotine that you can put into your mouth and get high being completely transparent and vulnerable I've been addicted to nicotine on and off my whole life in high school I had my first cigarette and I love that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] was amazing I was chasing that high for a long time I'm not proud of this I'm ashamed of it but the goal of this video is to be honest with you and show you the actual things that I use on the day-to-day I like it for zoning in for coding pop that in zone in put my headphones on and just do the thing this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is super addicting and actually my family has a history of heart disease so when I told my doctor this they told me that I needed to get off of it immediately so right now put it in the comments and tell me that I should stop and I hope to be off it by next time billion dooll company [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] legit best kept secret in business is this product right here tell me about it this is clavo it is email marketing software it's email and SMS marketing software right now we have a list of 250 to 300,000 people which means we spent about $4,000 a month and send some millions of emails every month this is actually cheap compared to the revenue that it generates it technically generates somewhere between 80 to $120,000 a month it's different every month but that would be like an average of what that looks like so funny story is actually clavio they were the very very first sponsor of starter Story the CEO who started it he sent me a check for $12,000 to sponsor the newsletter they're probably a big reason that starter story exists now but you don't have to use clavio I think the most important thing is that you do Implement some sort of email marketing strategy into your business I think it's is one of the most underrated things that people don't actually do really simple stuff like having a welcome sequence when someone signs up to your email list you send one two three four five different emails and tell a story in your emails and then set up basic stuff like when they go to your checkout page and they don't buy something you send them some emails to remind them and potentially even send them a discount these are called either called email flows or email sequences all businesses that make a lot of money they do this so yeah clavio that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] works thank you guys for watching I hope you got some inspiration maybe found a cool thing or two I'll see you guys in the next one peace

when I started AI career which is at 8,000 Mr currently I was still an employee at IBM how did this girl build a $100,000 Pere AI app while working a full-time job well it's because of how she's growing it to find customers online uh you have to think about where your clients are Pauline spent her first few years as a part-time Indie hacker building side projects but not seeing much success then after several failures she found a winning idea in one of the hottest yet most saturated Industries right now ai apps but it turns out there's still plenty more opportunity than you might think I think the biggest opportunity might be to I spent over an hour talking to Pauline about her AI business and what I really tried to figure out was how she was able to succeed in such a crowded Market good news is she shares everything how to find good ideas her framework for marketing and AI tools and some unique ways to reduce turn for your users all right let's get into it I'm Pat walls and this is starter story welcome Pauline thank you for coming on it's great to have you tell me about who you are and the business you built hi I'm paen and I built AI Crea it's a service to renovate home in s thanks to AI you just upload a picture to the service you selected a style and uh a few seconds later you see your kitchen in a very modern or Scandinavian way AA has more than 8,000 user right now it makes around 8,000 every month on the business model when someone sign up to the SAS they have free trials and uh then they are required to pay to continue to use the Service pricing models is a onetime payment with a certain number of photos and you also have a monthly payment with some extra features so you built this $100,000 per year app while you had a full-time job tell me more about that I learned to cult in uh engineering school after college I uh joined IBM and after this I kind of switch and I said okay thata science is not what I want to do all my life what I want to do on all my life is entrepreneurship but I wasn't ready to make a big jump of uh uh becoming an N Harker because I needed money as well when I work at IBM I had only the night and weekends I stopped IBM in June two months ago I think it's really different when you are working on a day job or you are Hindi hacking full time wow that's amazing so your side project allowed you to quit your 9 to5 and now you're a full-time founder what I want to know is how do you come up with ideas I think I usually find ideas when I encounter some problem either me or friends when it's friends like for a carea I ask question a lot of question really you have this problem but when how frequent you have this problem I really think am I able to do better am I able to build something around it am I able to monetize it and to find clients that's really important question and if the answer is yes to everything I start on working on it okay cool so we talked about ideas we talked about problems my question is once you find that idea how do you validate that is an idea worth building and that it can make money I start some marketing or I start to communicate on my product if I have some client kind of quickly then I said okay maybe there is something that I could do around it like for air I build an MVP and then I show it to a few real estate agent that I found online or in personal Network for people that say that's awesome I want to buy it now and they actually paid for this so that was the validation okay so get your MVP out there see if people are interested that is the way to build but can you tell me a little bit more about what it looks like to actually create that MVP in my opinion the sooner you chip the better because sometime you imagine your client want this but what they actually want is this so it's really hard to imagine what your clients want if you don't have clients when you start don't expect everything to be perfect AI ca for instance MVP was a simple features bad quality it was done maybe in month but uh then it's a year of work to improve it Pauline is the perfect example of how one person can turn a simple idea into thousands of dollars even while working a full-time job and her blueprint was simple she found an idea she built a really simple MVP and then she validated that it could actually make money by getting it in front of her actual customers that final step is where almost everyone goes wrong and this is why we built the starter story Academy it's a 5we program where you'll come up with an idea you'll build something simple and then you'll spend all your time focused on validation and if this thing can actually make money inside the academy is a clear and actionable track you can follow with Milestones deadlines and it's all gamified to get you to take action and work on the things that matter this is not just another course this is the turning point in your journey imagine what you could accomplish in 5 weeks if you simply worked on the right thing what's even cooler is that you'll do it inside our community of thousands of successful Founders working on similar problems and building online businesses that will change their lives so if you're serious about actually doing this thing and you're ready to take action I'm going to leave a link in the description where you can learn more okay so we build the MVP how do we go and actually find customers to find customers online uh you have to think about where your clients are you have many social media like for instance Faceook Facebook or LinkedIn or Reddit go through them and just type in the search bar like you are looking for real estate agent type it in LinkedIn let's see if you can find some communities on it for instance AI Crea my best marketing channel is uh probably Facebook and physical event maybe because real estate agent it's really an activity of human but for nexts directory my main marketing channel is Twitter because I have big audience there and my audience is mainly developers or people who want to do handy hacking so this product really is a fit with them okay so the best places to Market our products are where our customers hang out right but what if we want to accelerate that growth at the very beginning what are specifically some good places to launch apps as a solopreneur now I prefer to launch on product in order to get a backlink for SEO because it's a very good backlink but the visibility is less good than it used to be so I'm launching on product on and also on Twitter because I have a big audence there probably I will use my newsletter as well I didn't launch nextory on Facebook but I launched C on Facebook all right so now you got people interested in the product the next thing I go to is how to monetize it how do you determine plans and overall pricing strategy for an app like yours if you sell for a low price you you have an image of being a low cost you don't have the same client by selling low cost to high cost and also by selling higher price you might have less clients but it's less support as well so you have to also think about how do you want to be perceived and how much support are you able to deliver as well okay let's talk about business models do you prefer a recurring subscription or onetime payment I'd love to hear your thoughts on this I like to offer both subscription and one time payment because some people really don't like subscription I had a few subscription in many services and it was a nightmare to consel I don't like this kind of retention my button is very clear when you subscribe you have it consel and it's really easy I think it's really important to earn trust from your customer as well all right I love it besides building trust with customers are there any other hacks to reduce turn or just increase Revenue in general uh last year I had a high churn and I really reduced it like drastically by adding yearly plan it sounds stupid but now they are engaged for a year so they will use the service better the second one is uh I did a free trial so now people can try before subscribing they are able to see if the service uh fit their need and the third point is I really improve the service like the quality it's much better than uh last year it feels really like a photo okay and what's the tech stack you use how do you stay up to- date with AI and run your business profitably I use a Discord every day to talk with my cofounder and people are working with us I use crisp for the support clients that they can chat with us uh through the chat window I use Twitter a lot to share my journey to share what's new on AI Crea LinkedIn as well I'm starting to use it I use also buffer to schedule my tweets behive to send my newsletters but I'm still on the free trial on this one bra for the marketing automation of EMS the database authentification is super base but this is more like technical uh tool I guess I mainly use negs as a language but for AI models I use um python I think my business cost around three or 4,000 uh EUR to run each month But it includes servers it includes some marketing like we run ads sometimes also it could be the cost of a freelancer and going to personal event I could cut some cost but uh for the moment I'm not trying to save the most money I'm trying to invest uh in order to grow the business okay tell me about the biggest opportunities in the AI space right now I think the biggest opportunities might be to insert AI in uh existing product you receive email every day what if you have an AI that can help you to answer to your email this is a Services plugged in another one and that's something that uh could do because biggest opportunities I think is service got it okay another question for you since the space is heavily dominated by dudes how does it feel for you to be a successful girl Indie hacker yeah I don't know why but girls are not uh visible they are not doing much in the hacking so please uh don't uh retain yourself if you are girl to think oh but there is only men it's not for me no it's for you as well if you enjoy calling if you enjoy SAS please do it I think it's really important also if you are a girl to be visible because you will inspire other to do the same don't hide yourself or return yourself from building if it's something that you you want to try all right last question that we always ask all founders when we interview them if you could stand on a younger Pauline's shoulder and give her some advice maybe when you were just starting out what would you tell her okay so if you want to start IND theia King please don't wait for the perfect product challenge just start to do something because it's high likely that your first product will fail I mean I don't know any entrepreneur who achieved the success at the first time so you will learn a lot during during the journey so please chip very fast uh lunch when you have an MVP and ask for a lot of feedbacks and be consistent and also I think uh make connection with people who are doing mding we exchange best practices we exchange tips we exchange some things that didn't work in order to to improve us and my biggest lesson was uh I think it was to invest in yourself you are the common point of every project that you build and uh think about how you can reach your customers don't think like oh I okay could do some Reddit message or discard message or DM people I mean think about really how you could build genuine connection to your customers thank you for coming on the starter story Channel sharing everything you know and inspiring millions of people to start their own business see you yo guys I really hope you enjoyed the video and got some good nuggets with Pauline I think the business that she built is really impressive and I really like the way that she went about building it talking to customers and actually building something that people needed but I want to say something real quick at the end of the day the purpose of this video is to show you that regular people like Pauline change their lives by building a business but watching this video is not going to magically give you a business that changes your life you need to go find an idea you need to take action and you need to work relentlessly to validate it and see if it's something that can actually work while learning is important and action is the thing that's actually going to get you your dream outcome so if you feel like you're still struggling on this maybe some analysis paralysis not exactly sure what to work on then I highly recommend checking out the starter story Academy again it's not for everyone it's only if you're really serious about actually doing this thing actually building a business while you have a full-time job that could change your life inside the academy you'll get an actionable blueprint to follow every day it will give you the right habits but most importantly it will put you on the path on how to find an idea how to validate it's an idea that can actually make money and how to actually build that idea and bring it to life just head to the first link in the description if you want to learn more much love and I'll see you guys in the next one peace [Music]

TITLE: How I Built It: $40K/Month iPhone App
VIDEO ID: loXc0Tyi4R4
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loXc0Tyi4R4
================================================================================

so my mobile app puff count is currently doing $40,000 per month in recurring Revenue I honestly don't think you need any experience to build mobile apps because to be H like I didn't have any how did this guy build a $40,000 per month mobile app with no coding experience well it's all because of his unconventional approach to shipping marketing really is 95% of the success of a mobile app Steven creada started his journey as a typical online entrepreneur jumping from one business model to another while not seeing really any success with anything but one day he stumbled upon mobile apps and immediately recognized the opportunity not a lot of people are doing mobile apps right now but it's a lot easier than a lot of people think to get into it's UNT so I gave Stephen a call and asked him about his business and how anyone can start building similar profitable mobile apps from scratch luckily he shared his entire process how to find and validate your idea how to build an app with no experience and how to Market and monetize it all right let's get into it I'm Pat walls and this is starter story what's up Stephen it's exciting to have you thanks for joining the show can you tell me a little bit more about yourself and the business that you built yeah sure I'm Steven kada I build Viral mobile apps I've amassed over 12 million downloads on my apps in total I'm working on an app right now called Puff count that is currently doing $40,000 in monthly recurring Revenue so this is the last 30 days of sales for puff count as you can see we did $43,000 in sales if we look at the last 90 we have done just over $112,000 in sales so before we get into how people can actually start building these apps can you tell us what you really like about this business model with apps there's unlimited scale you can reach anyone on the planet and all you have to do is build it once and you can sell it a million times so it's unlike any other business in that way but also it's a lot easier than a lot of people think to get into with no code tools and with upw work you can build these apps in less than a month and there's templates online so you can start you don't have to start from scratch anymore the biggest misconception people have is that like it's hard to get into so like not a lot of people are doing mobile apps right now it's untapped but I honestly don't think you need any experience to build mobile apps because to be H like I didn't have any I don't design anything I don't develop anything I just have the idea and I know how to put a team together like you just need to be driven and not not give up on your idea got it okay let's talk about how you can actually build something like this step by step everything starts with an idea right can you share your ideation process I take mental notes of problems that I experience in my day-to-day life if you're building an app from the position of solving a problem for yourself you become the ideal user and that makes you so much better at creating the product and making it useful for the people you're trying to reach if you can solve a problem for someone and you can kind of take them through this transformation whether it be weight loss dieting quitting vaping if you can improve someone's life they are going to love your product and the marketing becomes much easier as well right because you can be like hey you have XYZ problem here's the solution so everything becomes easy if you're solving a problem for someone Steven is the perfect example of how someone with zero experience turned a simple idea into thousands of dollars but that came with knowing the right information and having the right problem to solve now imagine there was a place that gave you all this the problems to solve the blueprints to solve them and the strategies that turn simple ideas into million-dollar online businesses well that's what you're going to get at starter story it's a library of over 4,000 case studies and business idea breakdowns where you can access this all backed by data from real entrepreneurs so if you're serious about building a profitable side project head to the first link in the description and we're going to give you 52 micro SAS ideas just like Stevens so you can get started on your journey right now okay so scratching your own itch is definitely the way to go if you want to find a painful problem but what do you do after you get the idea for your app how do you actually validate it's an idea worth building I did market research I looked at sensor Tower looked at other you know quit drinking or quit smoking cigarettes apps and I saw that they were crushing it looked at Google Trends saw that vaping was on the rise and then probably the most important part was I looked on Tik Tok I saw that Vape videos were going super viral on Tik Tok but I think where a lot of young entrepreneurs especially fall short is they they give up on the idea too quickly if you have a good idea and it solves a problem for people like commit to it just like me for puff count the first four to 6 months I didn't make any money it was only after I locked in the marketing like marketing is 90% of being successful and validating an idea all right we'll definitely touch on the marketing later but for now let's focus on building the app what do you do after the idea is locked in what I do is I brain dump everything so I get on Google Docs and I brain dump all the ideas all the features that I want in the app I put all the competitors there and I kind of write out you know what I think the app should do and then from there I literally take a piece of paper and a pencil and I start to sketch out the app when you're looking at these competitors and you're seeing who's making money in your niche in the Market On the App Store you should be taking note of everything their features their onboarding their UI that will give you a good guide into what a get app looks like and then you take those sketches and you upload them to a site called 99 designs you upload sketches and you say here's the app here's the premise of it here are the features make my app come to life and you'll have 50 60 sometimes 70 plus professional UI designers all submit their idea of what your app should look like this is how I develop the UI for literally all of my apps okay and what about turning that design into an actual working app how do you build it with no coding experience you go on to upwork and you look for a developer you can price it based on like the complexity of your app for an app like puff counts fairly straightforward couple main features you get that done for less than 5 grand right you can get the MVP out there I recommend only hiring developers from Eastern Europe they're going to give you the best quality code for a cheaper price once you have your developer that you'd like to go with you do it on a per project completion basis so I don't pay anyone per hour I pay them when the app is complete it's on the store there's no bugs but 100% you can build an app for less than $1,000 you can go to a website called theme forest and you can download pretty decent starter template for any app out there and again you know just launching an MVP like keep it simple and if your budget is tighter like the simpler your app the better and how do we trust the developer what if they steal the idea for our app it's never been a problem for me and also your ideas are worth absolutely nothing and more likely than not the idea that you have for this app already exists so like the idea is out there you just have to trust someone I always take like a 15-minute interview call with with the people that I like from the applicants on upwork I get their Vibe I see are they coming to the table with more ideas for my app do they seem excited about it how they present but you have to get past that fear of hiring someone online that you don't really know like that's part of being a Founder is finding great talent trusting them and iterating as you go okay now let's talk about the elephant in the room marketing share your strategy marketing really is 95% of the success of a mobile app and Tik Tok is the best way to Market any app the only thing you need to be successful on Tik Tok is you need to know how to do market research so that's exactly what I did I went on Tik Tok I typed in vaping and I saved all of the most viral videos there and I put them into a spreadsheet so I could really understand what the hook was what the value was how they were shooting the content for example this one that got 8.3 million views drove tens of thousands of downloads for puff count I saw a viral video this guy had like 20 million plus views taking apart a vape so I was like okay cool I'm going to use the same concept and I'm going to show people exactly what are in a vape and then at the end conveniently call to action baby nothing crazy I think we're lot of people go wrong is like they'll make the entire video about their product and they'll talk about the features and all this other stuff and then it becomes a clear sales video like that sucks no one wants to watch a sales video on Tik Tok my Tik toks are entertainment first call to action at the end a quick two second call to action okay so right now Tik Tock organic is the bread and butter of marketing mobile apps but are there any other marketing channels that have worked well for you the beautiful thing about organic Tik Tok is if the video does well organically it's a great indicator that it's a great creative in general you put them on paid ads and click the spend my money button that's literally all you have to do because as long as the creative is good the algorithms on Facebook ads or Tik Tok ads or whatever they will optimize around that solid creative and they will find you customers what you can also do is you can find influencers on these platforms and you can pay them to make content for you in my experience it's tough to you know work with influencers they always want a ton of cash and they don't really care you know how the videos perform for you but you can find those diamond in the rough creators and you can reach out to them and get pretty cheap content and you can use that in scale that way uh as well okay cool now let's talk about the next step of the process of building a mobile app monetization what's the best strategy to turn these users or turn these eyeballs into paying customers yeah so there's there's many different ways to monetize apps and in my first games I monetized through ads because people were on the app all the time they were playing the game a lot so the ads worked well for or grid and whle but for these tool focused apps like puff count ads don't really work because you're not expecting the user to be on your app for a super long period of time so the way you monetize that is through inapp purchases you need the user to either buy your app or commit to monthly yearly Weekly subscription the kind of strategy that everyone is using now is the app is free you go through the onboarding and then you hit what is called a hard pay wall this is essentially a screen that asks you to pay and if you don't pay you can access the features in the app a hard pay wall is unskippable when I changed puff count to a hard pay wall and I made users commit to a free trial before they could use any features in the app it changed my business overnight my conversion rate shot through the roof upwards of 20 25% nice and what about pricing how can someone find the best price point for their app I AB tested different pricings I started at $4 went up to $12 right with a lot of users coming to your app you're getting a lot of data and you're understanding which price point gives you the highest LTV the highest lifetime value I use super wall to do this you can remotely configure your pay walls and you can change the price without sending App Store updates so you can do it much quicker and super wall will actually tell you which price point will give you the best LTV so I just optimize for that the highest LTV price point you mentioned earlier that before getting hit with the pay wall the user is being walked through the onboarding process what's your experience with that the onboarding is super important because this is an opportunity for you to walk the user through their own problem so for example on puff count my onboarding is extensive and I ask the users a lot of questions and some people say that's annoying I don't want to do that I just want to get into the app but the data has told me that if I walk the users through the onboarding they commit time and I'm able to walk them through their problem that puff count is solving so when they hit the pay wall they've thought about their problem a lot and they're like wow I actually really do need to quit or I really do need this product and they're much more likely to convert all right now let's get technical what tools in software do you use to build all of these apps the Tex stack I use to build apps is pretty short I use upwork to find and hire developers I use 99 designs to get the UI built I use super wall to AB test my pay walls optimizing your pay wall is how you're going to make money with your app like you need to optimize your pay wall and find the highest LTV so that is 100% essential everyone who has a mobile app should be using super wall I use Revenue cat for analytics data Revenue cat is good too because that will give you more data on your user lifetime value and again your user lifetime value is like the most important metric in your app you need to understand how much paying users are generating you over their lifetime so that you know how much you can spend on paid ads or on influencers or on installs and as long as your customer acquisition cost is lower than your LTV you're you're making money I use apps flyer as my MMP it connects with my my mobile app and Facebook or Tik Tok ads and sends data back to those platforms I use Tik Tok and Facebook ads to send traffic I also use mix panel amplitude to get kind of more in-depth analytics in my products and see what people are doing in the app once they do download it once they do pay and Gat code is like you should stay on the free plans I don't think you should ever really upgrade mix panel or amplitude like you should get your data understand what you need to change and then get out all right for anyone looking for ideas I want to ask what do you think is the most lucrative Niche to build an app in right now when I look at like the most profitable niches in mobile apps I think a lot of them do have to do with help helping people be better lose weight quit vaping quit drinking anything in the health space I think will absolutely crush and of course like there are already apps that are doing really well like in Fitness you have like my fitness pal you have all these weight training apps but it comes down to the marketing can you get in front of people at a cheaper cost than these mobile apps right being a young founder you truly do have an advantage because all these old heads in the industry these big slow moving companies that never iterate on their idea a small Nimble entrepreneur rur can take them out all it takes is one viral Tik Tok all right another question for you some people watching this right now may have started a couple other things before but didn't see immediate results and eventually gave up or quit what advice would you give to those people the struggle of building something new is it's never going to be perfect on the first try but I've done this enough times now to know it's a process and you have to keep iterating I know it's a good idea I know it can make money that's all I need I don't need it to work super quick right like I just need that Val validation um and then I can go out into the market and talk to talk to customers and make it better over time everything is built over time puff Count's been live for 4 years but only the last 6 or seven months have I really made decent Revenue per month it takes time it takes commitment and you have to be willing to learn all right next question how does a day in the life look like for a mobile app builder like you I'm actually nomading I've been traveling for about 6 months now I'm in Europe time so my day doesn't start till later in the afternoon like 1:00 p.m. is when I start hopping on the phone and talking to people so I have my morning to myself make a coffee go to the gym get a workout in and then I'm in the zone to start you know building start talking to my team start taking sales calls whatever it is and I work till 700 8 900 p.m. sometimes much later depending on what's getting done and then you know on the weekends I have a chance to explore an entirely new city and new culture and meet new people and try new things so inspiration is a fleeting feeling and when you do feel inspired to build an app or build a new project or work super hard like you have to take advantage of it going back to why I kind of like decided to be a nomad and travel like it's so I can do more of that so when I had these moments of inspiration I wasn't distracted by anything I can lock in all right last question that we always ask if you could stand on young Steven's shoulders and give him some advice or advice for anyone who wants to make it in this online business world what advice would you give first of all it's not as hard as you think like you just have to be driven and you have to you know be willing to to work with people who have skill sets that you don't Outsource what you're bad at and build a team around you build a team that you trust treat your team well and again don't give up super early on the idea it takes months sometimes years for a project to take off relentlessly talk to users get feedback and iterate Based on data a huge mistake that I see first time mobile app Founders doing is like they're like hey I have this random idea for a feature in my app that I think I'm going to spend two months developing right before launching my MVP don't do that like go to market with something simple that you can afford get feedback from users and then build on top of it with your team all right stepen thank you so much for your time the businesses that you've built are amazing and thank you for coming on here and sharing it with everyone peace Brother yo guys I really hope you enjoyed the rest of the video and got some good takeaways from Stephen but I want to say something quick at the end of the day the point of these videos is to inspire you and show you that this is possible so that you can go start your own thing on your own while learning is important and will give you new ideas action is the thing that's actually going to move the needle forward and take you where you want to go so research learn find an idea and then go build that as fast as you can if you're still feeling a little loss right now click that first link in the description and you're going to get a free list of micro SAS business ideas so you can get going on your side project much love and I'll see you guys in the next one peace [Music]

TITLE: How I Built It: $20K/Month Chrome Extension
VIDEO ID: ty9ZcimL6VE
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty9ZcimL6VE
================================================================================

learned how to build an extension and launched my first extension within like two or three days and today it's at about like 20 to $330,000 Mr how does one guy make over $20,000 a month with a simple browser extension well it's because he's building in the hottest niche in business right now ai s aadi started his journey as an employee working for almost a decade in Corporate America in different startups but now he's a solopreneur making a pretty good living while working on a side project he's passionate about so I spent over an hour talking to him and getting the complete scoop on his $20,000 a month AI business turns out it's actually pretty simple and it's not as saturated as you might think there's still plenty of opportunity you just need to know where to look in this video s shares a master class on building in AI where to find good ideas where to build those ideas and some unique ways to monetize those ideas even if you're a beginner all right let's get into it I'm Pat walls and this is starter story welcome s it's great to have you tell me about who you are in this business that you built my name is s um I'm a software engineer chat GPT extension that I built it's called super power chat GPT it's a browser extension basically that adds a bunch bunch of extra feature to chat PT I started this about a year and a half ago and today it's at about like 20 to $30,000 mrr I'm the only person who's been working on the extension it has been downloaded close to like I think 260 70,000 times weekly active users for the extension is around like 150,000 okay so you built a Chrome extension to over $220,000 a month what do you think is the best strategy for someone to do something similar two ways I'm thinking about this either building for an existing really big platform like Gmail for example or like Roblox Facebook YouTube Twitter they already have all these users all you need to do is to just build the extension and those users will find you Twitter had like hundreds of millions of users and if only like 2,000 people want that features that's like a good amount of like revenue for you to just live off of the other thing I recommend is going after platforms that have like an existing Marketplace but a smaller user base Zoom or Salesforce it's a lot easier to compete in a Marketplace like that they have less number of users but at the same time they have less number of people building for those platforms so that's another good place to build some product let's talk about the opportunity of building plugins in marketplaces what makes this better than launching a traditional SAS that has its own website most people when they want to start a project they just thinking about some s of like a standalone platform like a website that has all of its own back end and front end and everything but competing with like everyone on the Internet is a lot harder than competing with like a limited number of players in a smaller like Marketplace and it also helps a lot with validating the the product like it's a lot easier to build like a simple extension that runs on a user browser that way you can at least know if the idea is going to work out or not and if it's worth like spending more time on it got it so building for an existing Marketplace is a lot faster it's less crowded and it's a lot easier to validate your idea can you tell us how to actually come up with an idea for a Marketplace platform when Chad GPT was launched I already had some idea what features missing and initially when I was building the features I was mainly building the extension for myself and later I tried to go find the places that my users will hang out subreddits are one of them Discord channels are other one SL groups is another one Facebook group is another one I just like join all these groups and I started listening to people and trying to figure out what features other people want to see in chat GPT I think this is probably one of the best way to like come up with idea just go where your potential customers hanging out and see what they are asking for and just try to build that and this was actually one of my probably biggest like growth um hack that I apply to this extension just listening to people what they want trying to implement the feature and then going back and telling them that okay I added this feature you can use this extension and have that feature as part of the chat GPT interface s is the perfect example of a crafty internet Builder he finds his ideas by spending time researching researching in communities researching through his own problems and frustrations and most importantly researching other businesses to see if he could build something better now what if there was an easier way to shortcut all of this research well that's why we made this solo developer Deep dive it breaks down 50 different solo developer business ideas including their business models their customer profiles the platform they built on and a whole bunch of other cool stuff you'd want to know so if you're actually serious about building a profitable side project like sayah head to the first link in the description and I'm going to give you the Deep dive of 50 developer ideas for free and hopefully it helps you find your own idea now let's get back to S okay so we know where to build and what to build but what about how to build it what kind of experiences or coding languages do you need to learn if you know how to build a simple website you'll know how to build like an extension JavaScript HTML CSS that's how I built the very first version it was very very simple only had like two features basically but actually I have never built any browser extension before I learned how to build an extension and two or 3 days basically after chat GPT was launched so I'm not saying like every like simple project could work timing is really important here I bu really really early okay so you can find build and launch a product pretty quickly but how do you actually get users or eyeballs on your product I have not done any ads or anything for the extension and all of it happened organically by word of mouth or by me like posting on like different platform like I think the very first place that I posted it was UN Reddit I think it went like to the top of that subreddit that I posted for that day but at the same time like just people who like are on social media started writing reviews about like top like 10 chat GPT extension for example and my extension had those features basically so I didn't write them I didn't pay for them to be written I've never like actually paid anyone to write any article and it was all organic people started finding it started using it they like the idea they like the features and started sharing those ideas with their audience and that helped a lot with growing the um user base wow so you didn't spend any money on marketing yeah clearly being early helped a lot but I think what stands out is that people basically started marketing your plug-in for you because you built a really great product are there any other early opportunities that someone watching this could take advantage of right now and how can you build standout products in those niches AI is really powerful but it's still very early in doctors maybe are not thinking about bringing AI into their job but if you do there are a lot of like opportunities there one of my favorite thing is to talk to my users and every time I talk to any users I try to learn as much as I can about them what they do what's their background and how they use Chad GPT learning about how a lawyer is using Chad GPT to make their job easier or a doctor is using trpt to make their job easier is one of the best way to come up with new ideas and build new product for people who don't directly use AI okay let's talk about monetization we know how to build it and how to get users but how did you actually make your first dollar first for the first 9 months or so the extension was completely free like every feature of the extension was 100% free if you ask me today um I think I should have like monetized the extension earlier but at the same time I do feel like it helped a lot with like growing my user base so I wanted to capture that audience and I started writing a newsletter basically for like the the user base that I had and this is like three or 4 months after I started the extension I also posted my newsletter on some of the website that like you can get a sponsors for I like within like week or two I had like a my first sponsor paying me like a few hundred dollar to just poster ad on the newsletter basically when I first started writing the newsletter it would take me like maybe six or 7 hours every day now it takes like maybe 2 hours or so to write a newsletter wow so you took a pretty unconventional route and started making money from the newsletter first but how did you monetize the actual Chrome extension after like that like first 9 or 10 months I started to think about new features that I can add to the extension and ask people to pay for those extra features basically so I didn't ask anyone to pay for any existing features that the extension had and all of those features stayed free and I tried like different pricing like I experimented like higher price lower price and I like kind of found like a midle grounder that I think was the best way to price the extension so what are the coding languages tools and software you use to build as a solar preneur I spend most of my time inside vs code it's a code editor um that's where I write all of my code for all of my projects when I was bu building the extension I went back to like pure JavaScript with no Frameworks I used AWS uh for all of my backends all of my project basically live on like AWS for like the newsletter I use beehive one of the nice thing about beehive is like their monetization features they actually they have this thing called boost you can just like include some links in your newsletter and make money from it I use passion fruit that's where people find me and reach out to me to a sponsor the newsletter all right before we wrap things up I want to talk a bit about a controversial Topic in the AI space you know you built this product to over $20,000 a month but it's a chat gbt rapper right is there any downside to this and do you worry about this at all open AI can kill this product any day I was scared of that for a very long time and at this point I kind of feel numb to it I don't want to like worry about it today literally if my extension stopped working at some point I'm probably going to try and build other extension for one of these other major platforms that's going to make my my life a lot harder all right s final question what advice would you have to someone just starting out who wants to build their own software business or Plugin inside of a Marketplace try to validate the project as fast as you can just build the very first version and launch it and see if you get some users from it try to do that and the other thing I mentioned this earlier focus on your strength in my case it was building a product sharing it with people for free and like getting my first fewe users from that so those two things are the most important thing in my opinion yo guys I really hope you enjoyed the video and got some hopefully good tips and golden nuggets from s but I want to say something real quick at the end of the day the point of these videos is to show you ideas and show you it's possible but hopefully you take these ideas and go start your own profitable thing and your own successful business while learning this stuff is important taking action is the thing that's actually going to change your life so spend time researching learning finding ideas but then go build that thing as fast as you can if you're still feeling a little lost on this right now well click the first link in the description and you're going to get a free report of solo developer ideas that are actually making money right now so you can get going on your thing much love and I'll see you guys in the next one peace [Music]

TITLE: The Underdog: From $10/hr to $1.5M/Year
VIDEO ID: WGVxAmmJUmY

================================================================================

what's your story I lived with my parents working as a waiter part-time to make I think $10 per hour I was telling people I'm going to make it I'm the next Mark zukerberg and I'm going to have a billion dollar startup idea and I'm going to focus on it this is Mark a guy who tried everything to become an entrepreneur but nothing was working I didn't have any salary I didn't have any savings I was like broke like crazy like we're living in like I don't like 12 square m they were cockroaches then after years of failure he finally built a business that worked at some point life become like very beautiful like finally I made it I have my apps I make enough money to sustain my life and Co hit everything that I built for the last two years just suddenly disappeared wipe out I've been in the journey for like almost 5 years already I failed 30 startups and I didn't build anything I didn't save any money I didn't create anything that would last and then one morning I start to cry for no reason in his darkest moments Mark does something he never thought he would have to do it made me question why I was an entrepreneur why am I doing all that if I can just get a sense of like worthiness having a job but with everything on the line Mark discovers something that would change his life I feel bad and I decide I got to change everything I'm going to be an entrepreneur again but these times I'll do things differently this is the story of how Mark Lou went from working as a waiter for $10 an hour to making $1.5 million a year as a solopreneur welcome to starter story I was born in a family of Engineers know one of my friends or family members are entrepreneurs and I grew up like 25 years in this ecosystem or the only thing that matters is that you have to have good school grade you have to go University and I think that created a frustration inside of me because I didn't for some reason I didn't care about school so I was a bad kid I had bad grades I didn't feel like I was belonging to where I was people wanted to do stuff and I wanted to do the opposite a university was the same so they were partying but also studying and I didn't know what I was why I was learning what I was learning after four years of partying and barely attending lectures Mark graduated and had to make a big decision when my friends and I graduating from uni they all got a job pretty easily in Paris as a software engineers and I think around the time I might have seen the movie The Social Network with Mark zukerberg and for some weird Connection in my brain I was like this is me I'm the next Mark Zuckerberg it and the idea was to create a Tinder for sports lover there was no business plan in mind there was not even an idea of how to monetize that thing I was just I have to build that thing Mark has a brilliant idea that he believes will be the next billion doll unicorn so he takes The Road Less Traveled as I chose a different path I lived with my parents working as a waiter part-time like at night basically to make I think $10 per hour I was so arrogant that I spent a year working on this app I was telling people I'm going to make it I build this identity for one year of this guy who is going to build the next brilliant idea and you cannot even know what I'm working on because it's a brilliant idea right and I realized after 365 days that this app would never exist because I didn't have the capacity to build it and would never make money everything crumbled like all my oneyear arrogance belief fell apart and that's the moment where I stopped working on my app like I threw away all the code in 24 hours quit my girlfriend cuz I was a terrible boyfriend and moved to South Korea to the other side of the planet Mark experiences his first failure but he's still committed to becoming an entrepreneur he wants to prove to everyone that he can do this a different way a friend of mine gave me a call he was in South Korea and he said he could raise some money from VC to build an AI startup back in 2017 which was pretty cool we were both Engineers none of us was was good at marketing none of us was good at product and you know business and so we ended up having that This brilliant idea again is going to work out if we build a product we build a product it took 6 months to make an app but we didn't get any customers so in the end nothing happens after spending a year building another product that got zero customers Mark realized realized that maybe this whole Venture Capital thing wasn't for him but this gives him an idea after the AI startups I didn't have any salary I didn't have any savings I was like broke like crazy like I was living with my girlfriend as well we were living in like I don't like 12 square m they were cockroaches in the bathrooms and stuff the frustration of doing stuff for 2 years that led to nothing it made me desire the craving for like tiny project that have quick instant results I saw this ad on Facebook where you have those two people holding hands together inside of one mitt with thousands of likes I knew that if it works for them then it would work for me too I ended up going in the street sending those gloves because I was terrible at Facebook ad so I couldn't sell any online even though we we made zero with the gloves we probably like sold 30 gloves I still want to chase that thing show a different path show a different way and show that you can also make it with a different strategy with three failed businesses in countless Lessons Learned Mark realizes he needs to do something different he doesn't want to be a Starving Artists sharing his flat with cockroaches and spending all his time working on projects that never make money with this in mind he starts looking for his next [Music] idea I had this learning from those previous startup to start first with the problems and I was like what is a universal problem that everybody has that I can solve every business wants wants more customers right so maybe I can help any business get more customers and the idea was to create a little tool for escape room businesses to help them get more customers but I met a guy who is 100% marketer his job is marketing and he's like why don't you just try to sell it before you make it I listened to him I did exactly what he told me I sent some cold emails and I'm supposed to have the call with his business in Australia it's the first time I do a like a call with a lead I'm thinking like an engineer and I'm I like I'm scamming her just talking to her but she's so friendly she's like yeah so what is your idea and in the end of the call after 42 minutes she's like all right yeah send me the invoice I'll pay I'm sweating like my my armpits are sweating so much and I make her confirm I was like are you sure and then she said yes after a couple years and several failed ideas Mark's efforts finally paid off he made his first dollar he didn't need a fancy website or a perfect product all he needed was a solid idea and someone who is willing to pay for it if you're someone like Mark looking for their first idea trying to make your first dollar online then I have something special for you this is a free breakdown of 50 plus solo developer ideas to help you get started it includes a bunch of stuff business models Revenue strategies and a bunch of other stuff you'd want to know and it's for everyone no coders developers Indie hackers just click the first link in the description and we'll send it over to you for free mark efforts finally paid off he's made his first dollar online but most importantly he now knows firsthand that entrepreneurship works but when everything was at its best something very unexpected happened so this viral bought project quickly it made some enough money to sustain my life like $1,000 per month we moved to Bali and my days would be exactly the same I would uh send some emails in the morning try to get someone on the the phone call exactly like I did for the first dollar in the internet and the revenue grew to at the top you went until $4,000 in monthly recuring Revenue at some point life become like very beautiful like I finally I made it I have my apps I work on my own project I don't have any meetings I have customers I make enough money to sustain my life I live in belly I learn how to surf it's just so nice the revenue is going up and then I was working with physical businesses and Co hits everything closed down Revenue went from $4,000 a month to zero in like 24 hours hours everything that I built for the last 2 years just suddenly disappeared wipe out after Co brings Mark's business to zero he decides to take a break he keeps on surfing and living life then when the lockdown eased something insane happened my girlfriend and I decided to get married so we flew back to France and we had a beautiful wedding after a couple weeks they started to lock down everything again we were supposed to come back to belly but we couldn't so I'm I'm 28 years old I'm a married man I don't make any Revenue most of the businesses I've tried failed and I think at this moment I feel not so good like I don't know why I'm doing all that anymore I feel like I've I've never achieved anything really and I'm back at 28 years old in the house where I left to try to show there was another way showing that I failed basically and then one morning I have no clue what is happening I start to cry for no reason like I usually control my emotions I start to cry but have no idea what's going on and I look at my wall and I start to punch my wall four times like without even thinking my wall is pretty thin so it go through the wall and I'm shouting and I'm like I don't know like so much anger that just comes out it's like I've never felt this bad before I don't really know what depression is but the this lack of control that I had on me and these emotions bursting out without me controlling anything maybe after 5 years of failure with no income or savings 28 year-old freshly married Mark decides to do something that he never thought he would have to do he applies for a few software engineering jobs luckily because of his experience he quickly lands one of the positions and the job is like offering you $9,000 a month I look at that I was like i' I've been making $1,000 a month for 5 years and now you're offering me $9,000 per month I was like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on so I jumped straight into the job and when you have a job your boss is telling you today I want you to do that so at the end of the day once you've done that you've created the value for the person and it makes you feel like you're worthy I didn't get any of this in in the P so it really feels like I was useful to someone making more money than he ever had all while feeling useful to society Mark starts the question if he was ever meant to become an entrepreneur and maybe for him having a regular job is enough to live a fulfilling life those years of ENT preneurship you aim to create something people want and when nothing is actually working you're basically creating void and nobody cares about what you do nobody needs anything that you're doing so it feels like you're just useless it I can just get you know a sense of like worthiness having a job I started to have time for me on weekends because I didn't allow myself to take time off in the past it made me prioritize other parts of my life that I haven't touched previously from sleep to reading books to working outs and the overall happiness everything like the burst I had previously everything started to fade away and I started to feel much better 6 month after getting the job lockdown started to disappear and my wife and I decided to go back to belly I started to feel this little desire of Freedom that I didn't crave previously because I had 100% freedom but 0% worthiness but now the fact that I had to show up from Monday to Friday within 2 months I was already thinking like sometimes I don't want to do this meeting I don't want to go there I don't want to do that and I was seeing some tweets from from other software Engineers who either got fired who pursue their passion whatever and I see that there are some guys who have a totally different approach to entrepreneurship they don't raise money they don't work with the team they do whatever they want they build tiny project they make it fast maybe I want that a little seed is planted in Mark's mind yet again that maybe he can actually do this but he remembers all of the failures he's gone through plus he's got a great job and he's not ready to quit right away then one day he receives a phone call that would change his life around this time in Bal like couple month after we're here I just received a call they're like hey it was nice working with you bye and so when I got fired it was totally fine because I was I was already thinking of going back to the entrepreneurship world to get that uh sense for Freedom fulfilled again the moment I get fired I build my new identity I'm going to be an do things differently I will never spend month on a product I will never raise money I never have employees I'll never do all the things that frustrated me in the past I started to realize that each failure is not a failure if you don't give up each failure is a learning or a frustration for a future success and unless I quit in the middle all those failures will bring the success later it's just making a matter of making small bets small bet here small beted there and maybe something will work out I also decided to at the same time I build stuff I'm going to try to share this publicly so that people can see it so that if my app goes wrong if nothing happens then in the worst case maybe I'll have created a little following that's for the next project that I can use to get some eyeballs and not starting again from zero with a reignited passion and a new approach to entrepreneurship Mark starts to ship the first app I build is called mood to movie it's basically an app that match your mood and recommend you movies based on how you feel and then habits Garden it's like a little habit tracker I got around 10,000 users which I was super proud of because it's like also like it's helping people to get better in life I was so happy I worked on a tool that ranks productivity tips I built a landing page generator so you input some text and it's going to create an entire website for you with text images and buttons I created a link in BIO tool for entrepreneurs where uh you can show your entrepreneur resume Mark launched six projects in 7 months but he was still facing a big problem income he was only making $1,000 a month and he needed to figure out how to crack the code to make more money I start to make painkiller apps where it's actually solving a problems like I try to focus on that and I also try to focus on apps that that are not free that like users at some point have a pay wall the fact that I was shipping painkillers means something people know their struggle they know their pain so I come up with a solution so it's much easier to sell than a vitamine where like the Habit tracker for instance where it's fun but you don't necessarily need it I try to get a new approach of like launching viral I would focus on the launch part try to get as many ice balls as I can and I started to make those like skit where I would go on a podcast with jogan or I would be on a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and this did really well like people felt that I was having fun and that's where my Revenue went from like around $1,000 per month to I think it was around $4,000 in 2020 3 mid 2023 I had built somewhere around 10 to 15 products and I realized I was doing the same thing over set up a landing page deploy it add a button for people to pay send them an email create an account I was like What if I just create a little code base that I can reuse for every new project that I create so whenever I have a new ID I can make it faster I can ship it faster I did that I built it I think in like less than a week and I was like this is super cool why not just putting a price tag on it and offering it to other developers if they want to use it but I remove expectations from anything that I would launch I told my wife like hey you know maybe we'll make 100 bucks that would be nice I shipped the product went skating and I came back home opened my dashboard my strap dashboard like after 2 hours of skate I was like I made 500 bucks which is what I would make in like a week an entrepreneurship before in 2 hours I was like something is going wrong like I I I really couldn't believe it and then the next day I had made somewhere like around3 to 4,000 and I was like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on like I would make my best monthly salary in one day it's just insane I think the first month I made around 40,000 us the second month on November for the Black Friday that day I made S I think $8,000 I very surprised it was steady around like $50,000 a month except in November where there was like a burst at 65 and I realized one thing is product Market fit when it hits it's like it's there you can you can feel it I would receive messages from people that say like hey I cannot pay using your credit cards you except crypto like you would have people like ask me like to give me money it's the first time ever never usually I'm trying to convince people to give me money for my product I felt so happy I couldn't sleep at night I was awake looking at emails looking at the stripe dashboard going up I don't know it's a pure blee feeling it's just insane and receiving those messages from people who's like thank you you changed my life for me is like it was I don't know if I can ever be happier than that so the launch gave it an initial boost I also did uh lots of like free tools marketing so I would build this like logo generator and then on the right side you would have a banner that says like uh are you building a startups ship it fast with ship fast and there's obviously the YouTube episode that came a little bit later added lots of Revenue to the product ship fast so it went from like $50,000 a month to somewhere around $85,000 on the first month then 135 in the second month 135 in the third month and now it's slowing down a little bit to somewhere like around $80,000 a month okay so I do believe there are multiple people living up there and there is one that's very strong and that always thinking is telling you stuff is overthinking it's blocking you from making the first step it's going to find a good excuse for this idea to not work it's going to tell you that the idea you're working on is not perfect enough enough to be launched so my advice would be to it's cliche but it's start anything start make the smallest version of your app as fast as you can and the second part learn where you're comfortable sharing your ideas if it's text go on Twitter if you're comfortable with videos go on Tik Tok if you're comfortable with images and you know how to tell beautiful stories with one image go on Instagram and learn how to blend those two things together and see how things react I failed 30 startups around that but if you don't quit then at some point you'll win it's just a matter of not quitting before you win start now and ship fast that's Mark's formula for being a successful online entrepreneur but here's the problem when you're starting out and when you have an idea for something you don't really know a whole lot about what to do you don't know necessarily if the idea is good you don't know how to validate it and you don't know how to monetize it well the best way to learn is to talk to people or study people who are a few steps ahead of you that's what starter story is for it's a library and community of inspiration

TITLE: I Turned $150 into $2M/Year
VIDEO ID: 8yCXyCN_NR0
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yCXyCN_NR0
================================================================================

this guy turned $1150 into a $2 million AI app but what's even crazier is he barely even knew how to code in February I bought the domain sgt. for $150 watch a bunch of YouTube tutorials and we got our first customers in March he invited us into his house in Lakeland Florida to show us exactly how he started this thing as a solar preneur and the marketing strategy he used to grow to $200,000 Mr we started leaning up a lot into and just found a tremendous amount of Success Through that channel before the success Joseph tried and failed several business ideas unfortunately one of those was crypto and it left him with a $150,000 penalty from the federal government we talk about what he learned from this and how it gave him New Perspective that eventually led to a new business idea that would change his life after a few days of like trialing it I cracked it in this video Joseph shares his exact ideation product development and marketing blueprints that he used to build a $200,000 per month AI app I'm Pat walls and this is starter story hi Joseph thank you for having me in your beautiful home tell me about this business that you built yeah so we made uh stealth GPT it's a web app subscription based model like a SAS and basically what it does is it can generate AI generated text that's undetectable or it can take text from things like Claude chat gbt Gemini and make that undetectable we got to $190,000 Mr recently took us about 15 months to do it wow let's talk about some of the financials around this like how much revenue how much profit is this doing profit we're doing about10 to $30,000 a month after all of our expenses and everything most of our money goes into marketing a new customer acquisition um it's a lot of reinvestment into the current business so that we can continue growing at the rate that we're growing at we spend about $100,000 we're we're on a pace like it always is adjusting upward we've also brought in a staff so six to seven people we're actually hiring two more people right now we spend I think about like 50 to $60,000 a month on salaries alone other than that it's like our database and our hosting and you know our AI stack and everything like that kind of composes of probably about an additional I want to say like $5,000 so I think gave you about $160,000 worth of a picture so in the lifespan of stealth we have had 400,000 signups about 15 to 20,000 subscribers as a whole active subscribers we're looking at about 8,500 wow yeah that's amazing yeah can you give me a timeline of how you get into coding how you get into Indie hacking I was a big fan of RuneScape when I was a kid like giant RuneScape head and I remember when I was coming out of college I started looking at RuneScape again I was like now I'm a bit older I'm a bit more mature I don't want to spend 13 hours a day playing RuneScape anymore and I kind of like the idea of coding I I know that's something it's an important skill so I'm like let me figure out how to make a bot to do some gold farming and in RuneScape I started Harvard's like CS 50 class watch a bunch of YouTube tutorials started building for my for myself like so for example I built a website for myself and I built like a blackjack game took a few years to you know learn how to code that kind of thing and build stealth GPT all right let's talk about failure for a second so I know that in your journey you had something that kind of really set you back can you tell me a little bit more about that I was 23 years old I started my first company J squared invest and I started because I was getting involved with like crypto and stuff like that I saw there's like a huge Market need for people who didn't understand how to get into Bitcoin or ethereum they didn't know what coinbase was they didn't know how to open up a wallet so I just an opportunity like any other entrepreneur I had no money so I bought I made I got a loan from my father got the lawyers got the company ready all that kind of stuff and we just started taking in clients 2017 markets were great very bullish everything went to the moon until 2018 came around and um pretty much I lost all my money um I had a lot of money in the crypto markets of course the company got rinsed and then a few months later I get hit with this email out of nowhere from the cftc I guess there's like some like accusations of like oh I took client money or stuff like that every time I got an email from these people it was like it was devastating it was devastating to get an email from them but it was also devastating every day thinking like are they going to do something today are they going to email me today are they going to who knows what cuz you're at their full Mercy you're at the full mercy of the government um at that point and you got really nothing we later settled with them after I think like two or three years of dealing with this issue it was like a $400,000 total settlement um still paying for it to this day the whole process cost us $50,000 um before we even got to a trial before anything like that because I was broke at the time I couldn't pay any of it I had to completely borrow it from my parents having to do that was like devastating um you as like a child you want to make your parents proud and you want to make them happy everyone was really happy for me when I first started my company and they were very impressed and all that kind of stuff and then here I am having to beg for their help or else I'm going to get crushed like a bug like by the government and it was um it was a horrific situation but um thank God my parents I'm blessed to have loving parents and they're always there for me um and they always have been there for me so really appreciate that yeah coming off that how do you find this idea for stealth GPT how do you come up with the idea 2022 rolls around and chat GPT is like a thing and I was like okay this is going to dominate online content people are going to produce all this content with AI and they're going to put it online naturally there's going to be some kind of push back there's going to be people who care is the content that I'm reading right now human or is it Ai and Tik Tok because it I guess spies on the neural Nets of your brain or something like that just knew I was thinking about this and served me up a video in my timeline it's like hey there's this AI detector called gp0 they're able to scan with like a 99% accuracy is this content AI generator not so I started going to work just reverse engineering it really trying to figure out can and I consistently beat this AI detector and keep making it say that this is human generated after a few days of like trialing it I cracked it like eventually it just every single response I was throwing through the AI detector was coming up human and I was like okay we got something here and so around January is like when I first had the idea for steal GPT after seeing that Tik Tok video and then in February I bought the domain steal gp. for 75 bucks a year and they make you buy two years minimum so it's $150 by March we had our first uh real website with nextjs and react live and we got our first customers in March Joseph was able to change his life because of one simple SAS idea he turned into millions he showed us that all it really takes is a willingness to learn from others paired with a solid problem to solve if you're serious about doing something similar but you're still looking for an idea well you're in luck you can download our 52 micro SAS idea report to show you ideas just like Joseph's that will give you inspiration to get started on your your own project just click the first link in the description and you'll get it all for free and if you're serious about actually building it alongside other successful Founders consider joining starter story and we'll help you with that much love and hope you guys enjoy the rest of the video you build your MVP how do you get your first customer I listed the website on future pedia which I saw some people talking about we kind of let people use the service for free like 10 tries for free and then they would have to pay for subscription so we offered like three different tiers of pricing for as low as like $4.99 to like 15 bucks yeah and then we got these two customers and I remember thinking at the time I was like how the heck did these guys find us like in the in the wide ocean the internet and they're like oh well we actually heard about you mention on the show from this Tik Tok guy this guy named Phil covers a lot of products like basically every single day like obsessively over like every project so when we listed on futurepedia I guess he follows that and tracks that and it was like a cool little cute video and that's how we got our our first customer so Bill thank you wherever you are thank you so much that's the power of just posting your stuff you never know what's going to happen right exactly yeah that's true so you got this product it's pretty much validated and now you're trying to scale it how do you actually scale a business like this yeah we kind of went at it with like a ucg type strategy on like Tik Tok and Instagram talking about like the service and just kind of letting people know at that point it was like Market education because something like this has never existed before we need to tell people like hey what is stealth GPT what does it do just kind of intrigue them into it so a lot of focus on just explaining what the product is and why people need a product like self GPT when we got past the summer we started leaning a lot into Google ads and really investigating Google ads and just found a tremendous amount of Success Through that channel they were converting like insanely low cost per conversion $10 $15 $20 in the early days and that allowed us to scale a ton so we would get a lot of money in and then we just pour more into Google ads and it was just like putting gasoline on a fire just kind of kept going and going and going so you've built this software to hundreds of thousands of users what's your approach to building a great product when you're trying to build a solution to a problem you're trying to make money on it you're trying to build a business you need to make a solution to as broad of a problem as possible and so yes I talk to my users I do get their feedback I do ask them like hey what would you want to see on these different tools and whatnot sometimes I'm like okay that that that's a good suggestion let's let's kind of play around with that that could help a lot of other users but then sometimes I'm just like n that's something that maybe you would like and that would be great for you and no I'm not going to spend hundreds of hours building this whole complex like method that you want or feature that you want so really what I use our customers for as far as feedback goes is how is the quality and then also with the experience like how is it using the app was it easy to figure out what this tool does what that tool does and that's where the users come in and they're very helpful as far as like other features and stuff like that like core stuff Engineers out there and coders they really want to build like the most complex like high powerered application out there and give the user so much Freedom that's horrible people want to use the internet like this I want to be able to give you my problem and in one click get that problem solved don't make it complicated don't add all that stuff now not every problem can be solved in one click but as much as it can be try to get it to one click yeah let's talk about tools and languages what is this company built on we're built on xjs and react I think that's like the best stack that you can work with these days one thing that was very critical to our infrastructure was like versel uh versell works really well with NEX and allows us to like deploy something out there in like a few minutes and hey if a user has a problem with it we can roll it back figure out what the problem is and then push it back into production and we use super base for our database and they've been phenomenal we use Discord a lot for our communication and we use buffer for our marketing management for like our different channels Instagram Tik Tok Facebook whatever zenes for like support Google Sheets and Google Docs and whatnot I mean they have a perfect suite for like us to collaborate on our documents and stuff like that you know GitHub of course got to be in there cool so you started this thing as a solopreneur you did it all by yourself tell me a little bit about that experience when I first started out building the idea I didn't really think I needed too much you know it was going to be like a very basic rudimentary idea let's see if it works and after the first 2 months once I actually started to see like real traction I I knew at that point in time I knew it in my gut we got something good over here and if I can just get some more hands in the in the cookie jar that'd be really helpful to help me build this thing cuz remember I mean before that I didn't even know how to Cod so we went out there and did that I'm so happy that we did our team is uh phenomenal all of our developer hires have come through Twitter post so no one has a pedigree no one has really done anything before we've built this thing and we're kind of just building an amazing piece of software over here let's talk about ideas a lot of people watching this are looking for the right idea what advice would you give to someone who's looking for an idea that can make money like yours so the best way to kind of go through this is like think about problems in your life and I I've seen that as like common advice and it's true think about a problem that you have dealt with like something that bothered you something that pisses you off something that wastes your time wastes your money everything like that everyone's got problems like that or talk to people and ask some like problems in areas that are kind of passionate to you because obviously if you're working on something that you care about you're passionate about you it so much better than if you didn't care it was monotonous and it was boring also you need to honestly be able to critique your idea and and be honest with yourself to say is this actually good will people actually buy this or am I just kind of hyping myself up and thinking I just came up with a next big thing all right let's talk about Day in the Life what is it like to have built this business and run this business fulltime the first thing in the morning is just systematically like checking all the systems making sure everything's green everyone's good now we're done with that let's check on our ads performance so I go look at what our ads are doing right now I look at what our ads were doing yesterday after we get through all that kind of stuff the rest of the day is just kind of a lot of ideation a lot of talking with the team making sure everyone's doing what they're supposed to be doing I'm very like hands off for the most part like I'm not like hey man what are you doing it's more like you know what your role is you know what your role is you know what your role is and then constantly kind of getting updates and feedback as we kind of go through it and learning like I actually spend like a considerable amount of time like scrolling the timeline on Twitter I see a lot of your posts on there I see a lot of other great like Indie hackers and Founders and whatever and even some accounts like a non account accounts anime profile picture get no traction they get maybe one or two likes on them I'm like you know what that's a that's a good idea like I'm I might give that a shot a lot of learning like always trying to stay up on the like the dayto day we're never out of the loop and that's very important to the process yeah well the last question that uh that we ask all of our Founders who built these amazing businesses if you could uh sit on Joseph's shoulder you know when you're just starting out what if advice would you have for him I would say like the marketing really is just important if not more important than the product itself at the end of the day if you cannot get distribution if you cannot get eyeballs on what you're building you're toast also there's never been a better time to build you can if you have a laptop and Wi-Fi even if you don't have Wi-Fi there's a Starbucks down the street or something that does you have the power with AI with things like versel and super base and the free tear out there you have the power to put something online today don't waste this opportunity I love it thank you so much yeah what you built is amazing follow this advice and you'll make millions you could make millions with AI good luck all right see you yo what's up guys thank you all for watching Joseph's story I think the coolest part is how he took just a very simple idea and turn it into a massive business thanks to this crazy AI track he's proof that all it takes is a simple idea and some hard work and you can build a life-changing business if you're serious about starting your own thing but you still don't know

make and a bunch of other cool information you'd want to know just click the first link in the description and we'll send it over also leave a comment on some other types of businesses that you want us to cover or any other content you'd like to see us do I'd love to hear your ideas all right that's a wrap I appreciate you guys a ton and I'll see you in the next one peace [Music]

TITLE: They Make $1.4M/Year With AI
VIDEO ID: b5JhfGHafZA
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5JhfGHafZA
================================================================================

these guys went from0 to $120,000 a month with an AI app and the crazy part is they did it in less than a year I drove out to Miami Florida to ask them exactly how it works and how one platform got them 10,000 paying users in a matter of days so was a sort of like a great springboard for us in order to establish a solid brand the boys started their Journeys working at VC back startups but they grew sick and tired of the system so they got together to build something for themselves and along the way discovered something that would change their lives the main reason I think C magic won is in this video Blaine Ramone and Justin share their exact blueprints on how to come up with a million-dollar idea how they built it in 2 weeks and how they scaled it to six figures in Mr in just 10 months I think one of the key things here is I'm Pat walls and this is starter story hi right Ramon thank you for having me we are here in this beautiful Miami apartment with your two co-founders Blaine and Justin and we are here to talk about this amazing app that you built tell me about what you built yeah so we built CM magic. which leverages AI to create content with the context of your videos audio files conversations any media really you can repurpose purp it and we started cast magic about 10 months ago and today we're north of 120,000 in Mr let's talk about the opportunity of AI apps what's going on here I think if you can embed yourself into an existing workflow and radically remove the friction of like the barrier to entry to doing something such as creating a podcast those are the tools that are really taking off and you know I think these are real needs and not just a sort of vitamin it's more the painkiller an allergy thing yeah all right so we got blae here he's the co-founder and uh he runs product tell me about how you found the idea for this app yeah so essentially I host DTC pod with Ramone and I noticed this problem which in my mind at the time was just about how do you write show notes from your podcast I can't just like assign it to a random VA who isn't going to understand the context of like the person I talked to and all of that so that was kind of the inspiration when we saw AI coming up we're like wait a minute like I think AI might be able to do this the real lesson there for any founder is just by doing something and putting yourself in a situation where you're constantly doing you're going to unearth problems that are worth solving and maybe those problems have bigger implications than you thought they would in the first place yeah yeah you figured out this problem that you have and then you decide to make it a product what happens after that I think distribution for an early stage startup is something that's like super super critical starting with yourself at the core of it build something for yourself and then very quickly get as close to the customer as you can either create content that attracts people to you and so they can kind of come inbound so that's why I think personal brand putting out content is such an important thing or find a distribution partner that can like really help you scale so we're talking with the team at appsumo and they said hey we we've got this opportunity would you guys be down to like launch 2 weeks from now and we're like oh 2 weeks but that's a really good opportunity to get distribution and start growing basically yeah let's talk about marketing and growth you guys grew zero to 120k Mr in 9 months how did you do that so appsumo was a sort of like a establish a solid brand we launched with them and I think it's been one of the most successful launches ever on appsumo so you know around 350,000 in revenue generated gave us probably around 10,000 users or so we offered a lifetime deal which means that our customers have access to us and our services forever for people that self subscription say well in this world would I ever do that when I can get recurring subscription but we needed to build a brand we needed to build a foundation we needed the feedback the other thing that worked really well for us was creators we started incentivizing people to create content on socials you know some people we were paying some people we were reaching out as to be an affiliate and one of the best ways to do this is like scrape Instagram scrape the platforms find companies that might be adjacent Industries look up those hashtags and then build volume once you build volume and respon responses now you have leverage to negotiate with the rates and then just go from there and start paying out based on cpms and then decide who's worth sponsoring and get enough volume to test if it's a viable channel for you or not yeah you have a oneman marketing team you don't have some big marketing team you've grown this business to 100,000 120,000 Mr how do you operate a marketing team with one person I have contractors that help me on a specific vertical but something people don't do enough is like research you can actually go and like map out how did this company that is similar to us that serves our same exact customer base how did they get distribution and so in our case I went back and tried to find businesses that really grew through Affiliates so like how do I set a system here and a tangible example here is I noticed myself going back and forth with a bunch of the creators on like ideating content Concepts and then I was like this isn't going to scale so I created a whole notion document of a bunch of Concepts now I don't have to get on a call with them and iiz on the content so it really just all comes down to systems rone and the boys are proof that you don't need funding to start and build a million-dollar business in less than a year all you really need is a simple idea and the right strategies to bring it to life and the best way to do that like Ramone said is by studying other businesses so if you're serious about building your own product like the boys at Cass magic but don't know where to start well right now you can download our Deep dive SAS report for free it'll break down over 52 different micro SAS business ideas making millions along with trending ideas growth strategies and tons of other stuff you'd want to know just head to the first link in the description to get it now let's get back to how these guys actually built this thing all right let's talk about tools what coding languages and what tools did you use to build this app in the first two weeks I can't emphasize enough how much you have to accept building an imperfect product a bit of a unconventional choice to a lot of people I built this with Elixir it's very stable it's a language that scales really well and because Elixir has a tool called Phoenix and live view you're able actually to build the entire front end and back end in the same language for the landing page we built it in webflow we could make it look good using templates and therefore we could spend all of our time as a development team working on the part that mattered most to our users which was the product all right let's talk about pricing how how is cast magic priced and how did you come to that strategy we offer a subscription build monthly with a cap on usage it's funny we really just kind of threw out numbers that we wanted to test and found that it worked and we are always analyzing what we're spending on llms and transcription making sure that we have enough margin to justify the outputs that we're giving our customers and so far we've been able to keep those in Balance so that both our customer and us can win from the relationship okay we are back with Ramone to talk now about AI it's changing like crazy differentiation tell me why was cast magic successful when there are thousands of other AI apps that weren't so the main reason I think cast magic one is for three reasons number one we solved our own problem number two we build a brand by partnering with the right creators and number three we build and continue to invest in the product to increase the quality of the outputs that's really what it boils down to in an AI product it's not just how does a platform work but what is the quality of the output that I'm getting here and are they taking any shortcuts in the back end and clearly we weren't so so then the customers are now invested into US you have to ask yourself how do I position myself and how do I build a brand for the long term here all right so what do you do when chat gbt comes out with a new model and then they essentially replace your product how do you think about that we are solving our workflow problem and there's always ways in which you can continue to optimize that process more and more that isn't Chad gpt's business Chad GPT is there to provide the infrastructure they have a future not a prodct they solve one small pain point they don't solve like an entire solution that only a platform that covers a workflow from A to Z can solve yeah tell me some of the numbers some of the financials behind this business turn single digits like net turn is single digits that goes back to the value of like you know solving like a existing problem not not creating a novelty we have over 120,000 in Mr we're growing over 20% month over month I think one of the key things here is we don't spend over 20% of our revenue on marketing marketing always has to be less than 20% and that is because we want to make money we want to be profitable so far it's working and you know those are principles I think that we'll continue to to use to grow the business yeah so you guys built this three friends tell me about why your team works and why why you guys work so well together I think the reason we work so well together is because we've all been through the Journey and we know it's a long one and initially in the beginning we're not getting stuck in the small details and we also know when to have fun yesterday we were meeting we did our whole road map thing and we took out some time to go and play nine holes of golf it's not that serious so I'm curious on Blaine's take here though in Justin's yeah I mean I think the biggest thing is just like alignment right I think so many co-founders especially maybe first time around they partner with people out of personal convenience or because out of necessity almost rather than like true true alignment the second thing that I think is so so important is that you have skills that compliment each other so everyone can stay in their Lane having a team that doesn't like overly overlap and step on each other toes I think is massive so I think finding not only alignment but also people that you can build with that you like Vibe with but also compliment each other other's skill set is like the best thing that you can do I think a a big part of that is the trust that we have in each other too and we're very honest about what we're building like we're not afraid to say like hey this isn't as good as it could be and I think that shows and where we are today and and what we've built let's talk about about VC you guys have all gone through the VC I'm going to be the anti- VC poster tell me a little bit about your past with VC and how you're thinking about these days yeah so I've had two Venture back companies in the past the first was seated their series C they've raised over $80 million to date the second one was called Omni panel we were backed by CRV we raised a $2.5 million seed and this time around it just feels very different it feels like we spent all the time we would have spent like talking to VC's exping like the broad vision for our product and we just spend it talking to customers and building crap for ourselves that we ended up using um so I think that's something that's really valuable for anyone who's getting to start don't seek validation elsewhere build something that customers want they're willing to pay for and that you yourself that solves a problem for you and you'll be in good shape and then if you want to take VC to accelerate that growth that's up to you and you can figure out if that's the right decision for your business yeah I think in my experience I built a business called trend. iio I tried Racing for that business for almost 4 years the effort that it took to actually get good at fundraising it's a skill set in itself if you're not great at building a business and generating revenue and you choose to get great at fundraising you're just going to have the whole thing backwards how do you guys all work together how do you stay aligned how do you meet as a team I think from a team perspective what's really cool about how we operate is you know Ramon's in Fort Lauderdale I'm here in Miami Justin's in Austin a lot of the work is async during the work week but what we're really mind F and the reason we're all here today in Miami is because every quarter we get together for at least a week to like meet on all the important things so I just think it's like a really great model for startups or Founders who are like looking to get the business started it's not like where you are where your office is ETC it's like find a great group of people wherever they are in the world and you know do your own thing but like make sure that you know you also get together to get like really aligned on the things that need to happen in your business the other thing that we do just in terms of operationally is we do a Monday 30 minute standup call and a Friday 30 minute standup call just to align on product what everyone's doing but we really try to block out the calendar and not be stuck on calls all day and more focus on like just shipping yeah all right thank you guys for having me in this amazing apartment this amazing business that you guys built do what they did follow this advice and you have a $120,000 Mr AI app good luck guys hey guys I hope you took away some golden nuggets from that video that'll help you along your business Journey and for anyone that still feels a bit lost maybe you don't know where to start or you need some

TITLE: I Make $1M/Year As An Introvert
VIDEO ID: trNGj1BN1GU
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trNGj1BN1GU
================================================================================

this guy makes $1 million a year with a business model built for introverts ghost writing and the best part is he did it all in Just 2 years I've never been a sales guy I'm an introvert which is why I became a writer I drove out to Miami Florida to ask him exactly how it works how he got started and the framework he used to go from0 to $65,000 a month in just one year what I follow was called the framework when he first started Marcos was trying buing every business model Under the Sun but he was barely making any money then he stumbled upon ghost writing and learned a secret that would change everything the main thing that people were talking about in ghost writing is you're going to get people followers and then I quickly realize there's a much better way to do it if I just in this video Marcos shares his exact blueprints on how to find cloth and retain clients to build a million doll Pere ghost rating business from scratch I'm Pat walls and this is starter story Marcos pleasure thanks for having me yeah tell me about who you are and what you built yeah I'm Marcos I'm CEO of the birdh house uh we're a Twitter ghost writing agency and we essentially write the tweets the threads we repurpose clients videos and we put them on Twitter so that they can obviously go viral get views and make sales and we went Z to 65k a month in one year uh we're looking to scale up to over a million this year so 100K a month explain me what what the hell is Ghost writing yeah when I discovered ghost writing through Twitter I basically just realized that Founders CEOs business owners even influencers a lot of these guys have ghost riters on the internet because they just don't have time to do it so we go and help people Outsource that and what I ultimately landed on was coaches consultants and education companies because these are the people that can actually help monetize faster we'll go and repurpose viral clips and viral videos or even full videos and full podcasts uh we have long form posts which is a new thing we have articles replies you could do spaces you can help set up spaces there's really so much that goes into it now and certain niches have different formats of content that are going to perform the best so depending on the client we're going to put out a majority of those different kinds of content threads posts long forms articles Etc all right so give me a timeline of your backstory and how you get into this yeah so when I was 19 I was at basic training for the Army and my friend actually showed me like day trading on his cell phone and this was kind of my first introduction to internet money so I go from there and I'm trying pretty much every business opportunity Under the Sun Drop Shipping affiliate marketing crypto day trading blogging you name it I've done it and then from there I quickly realized that I'm a little introvert I played video games I've had a Blog I did Marketing in college and I've done a little bit of writing I've actually been on Twitter since 2011 uh so when I chose copywriting I probably had like 2,000 bucks to my name it was it was pretty it was a challenging time but I'm the kind of person that kind of I always knew knew that I would make more money like I always had that mindset I bought a course back then it was like 50 bucks a month and it kind of taught me the ins and outs of the ghost writing thing it gave me an offer and after I signed my first client for 1,000 bucks and I find a second one for 1,000 bucks I reinvested all 2,000 into a bigger course that cost me 2,000 bucks per month so it's actually a $112,000 course so I spent all of my money that I didn't have and it came back and I had signed a $3,000 per month client so now $2,000 month course $3,000 a month client I had like just enough money to live the rest is history from there that's amazing yeah my favorite part about marcos's story is that he chose one idea and stuck with it until he hit a million dollar a year but it was never easy it required having the right idea and studying other businesses that paved the way before him if you want to do something similar to Marcos but you don't have an idea or you don't know exactly where to start you can download our free report of 50 plus real world product High services in this report you'll learn exactly how 50 Founders got their ideas how they grew how they got customers and lots more and then if you're really serious about starting something then consider joining the starter Story community with thousands of people building businesses that will change their lives just head to the first link in the description and you can download the report 100% free all right let's get back to how Marcos got his first customers let's talk about how you got your first client and how you scale it to 10K a month specifically how did you do it yeah my first ever clients were from upwork from there I always say you have to kind of Stack your case studies and stack your testimonials so I took that job and used it as social proof for my Twitter DMS and I was sending out 100 200 DMS a day had it all in my notion following up and that took about a few weeks before I kind of really landed some interest and I was able to sign my first 1K a month CLI I didn't get the best results at the time but what I did get was he sent me a message and it said like I got seven free trial subscribers and I was like got testimonial so then I'm using that in my DMs to other software Founders and eventually I landed my first 3K a month client which was a big deal for me and that was a a coach and we crushed it for him this was the first time I really crushed it for someone viral every week and not only that what I realized is it drove sales and I was like okay he's paying me 3K a month and this thread probably made him like 20 30k so it's was like okay well he just made enough money to pay me for 10 months so from there it was like referrals in inbound it was I just focused on getting my clients good results so the referrals would come in my audience was building at the time I think at the time I was going 3K 5K followers I think I had 10K followers after like eight months in business and then from there it just been compounding ever since yeah you talked a lot about how to get leads but how to actually close clients yeah this is a tough one cuz I've never been a sales guy I'm an introvert which is why I became a writer and I'm sure a lot of people watching are introverts and that's why they do these kind of introvert Ed businesses right so what I followed was called The Closer framework what it allowed me to do is have a framework to follow hey why you on this call and kind of take them through a little bit of a journey on the call but ultimately what what I've really come down to is if you can just get on a call tell someone how you actually are going to help them and be honest and be a human most of people actually Vibe with that and if they don't Vibe with that you probably don't want to work with them anyway sales is really just about conviction so if you actually believe in what you're doing can actually help someone make more money it's pretty easy to sell yeah you grew this super fast it went from like 1K to almost 15K really fast how can someone else who's watching do something similar yeah so this is what I was doing and this is also what I actually have clients do or their teams it's cold warm and hot like I said I was sending 100 to 200 cold DMS a day so that's number one and that's really just saying hey giving them a compliment based on checking out their profile giving them your offer and then saying hey if you're interested let me know if not you're good don't even answer you don't want to be kind of too pushy and then what's called warm DMS it's just essentially dming people who are following you engaging with your content Etc it all starts with kind of creating content on your Twitter you always want to practice what you preach and then what's called hot DMS which is the people who are already interested they're dming you first they're saying hey I'm interested right so using those three and having a happy balance that's how you can really accelerate the clients that you land so it all starts with making content sending cold and warm dmms and getting the inbound leads and it compounds very fast like 100 DMS 200 DMS a day two to three tweets a day including like a thread and you're golden from there so you're doing well you got like $10,000 $15,000 a month and then you go to $50,000 a month what what how did you do that yeah so it's really two big things um number one is having kind of a mindset shift from tactic hunting to actually implementing so tactic hunting especially what we just talked about would be you're trying to plan out what am I going to write how am I going to send DMS what's going to be my script the implementing is actually going out and doing it and doing it not just once not just for a week but for 6 months 12 months straight and doing it every single day that's the implementing piece that really helps it compound cuz in the back end you're actually delivering your servicing like I said getting referrals and getting leads inbound but then also doing the outbound and when you combine those you kind of create a flywheel and then honestly after 10 20K a month I'd say every business has kind of a different point where you have to ask yourself do I want to be a solo preneur or do I want to be an entrepreneur and that's when I decided to start hiring team members and building a real business under a real business name now we're doing about 70k a month and our margins are about 60% we have two senior writers one Junior writer I have an ops manager who was my real employee number one she was my assistant now my ops manager and then I have a sales representative as well so a team of five six if you include me all right well let's talk about building a good team how to hire good people so that you don't have to work on the business all day right so what I did is I I put out a tweet I'm looking for my first writer to join the team and help me out and I essentially gave four or five different people a prompt and I was like write a thread write a Twitter thread and I just picked the best one and then from there I'm like you're on board I also kind of picked the person who who vibed with me the best from from a culture perspective so who am I going to Vibe with who actually has the talent and really thinking of them as a partner not an employee all right let's talk about tools what tools do you use to run this business yeah so I use all the basic stuff obviously Google Docs Google Sheets but further than that I use Cana for design we use Twitter of course we use Hemingway is a really great app that'll help you with your writing it'll show you which level grade you're writing at and help you dumb it down and make it simpler we use a tool called hype Fury to go and schedule all the tweets and we can schedule them there for clients and you can actually have client account access without actually being in the client's account and then we also use notion which is where we have kind of our company dashboards crms client hubs everything like that so I'd say those are really the main tools all right let's talk about competition starting a ghost writing business is seemingly easy how do you uh differentiate from your competitors when I started the main thing that people were talking about in ghost writing is you're going to get people followers and then I quickly realized there's a much better way to do it if I just make somebody more money than they pay me then I'll have a client forever so I differentiated my offer to I'll help you not only grow on Twitter but the growth is more of a byproduct I'm actually going to help you monetize with Twitter so it's a dumb for you monetization service if you just learn business principles and then you learn writing you can kind of offer that to anybody yeah so a lot of people love the idea of ghost writing can kind of sit behind your computer and write for a living how would you recommend someone to get started with ghost writing yeah so there's really two ways to do it there's the I have no money way and there's the I have money way the I have no money way is actually go on Twitter and be a user start to follow people that are going viral and follow people that are actually writing great content study what they're doing do it for yourself use yourself as the case study and then use that to do the the DMS the paid way would be to buy a course and I always say this when you buy a course just copy exactly what they tell you the most important thing is to do it yourself and actually build yourself a bit of a personal brain because what I quickly found out is if I was reaching out to somebody with more followers than me they'd be like well I have more followers than you why would I you so you have to do it for yourself and then you can do it for other people yeah so we're here in your beautiful Miami apartment tell me about what a day in the life like is for a ghost riding business owner yeah so I I guess I theme my days I kind of stole that from I think it's like Jeff Bezos if it's like a Monday I step back my meetings uh usually have between 12 and 15 meetings on a Monday so I'll go straight from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. uh and just meetings for those days and then I'll go to Jiu-Jitsu at night or something and then Tuesdays I like to have just like a blank calendar and those are usually the days where I'm going to sit down and edit some client content because I'm still acting as as Chief editor or I'll go out and maybe Source some new clients or I'll talk to the team or work on the business Wednesday again it's usually a call day/ content day and now as I'm stepping out more as a CEO I try to spend a lot more more time thinking I try to go on locks and stuff like that but yeah again I say a majority of my time is either in or on the business and I don't really do a ton else I know we live in Miami but I don't really go out I don't really party or anything like that so I'm usually just either working in around my business or I'm going to like go to Jiu-Jitsu at the gym watch TV play video games do something basic I'm pretty chill dude have you experienced any struggles uh building a business becoming an entrepreneur yeah I'd say the biggest struggle was shiny object syndrome like being online and you see people flexing Rolexes and Lambos and you just feel so inadequate and just seeing everybody do something new and you're always just peeking out that might be better that might be better but what I ultimately Learned was once you can finally shut that out and stick to one thing and actually fail through it and and keep going find your itty bitty bits of success and again continue to shut out the noise cuz again even at 2K a month 3K a month 5K a month 10K a month you're still seeing all that stuff it's not like it just goes away ultimately being able to have the self-confidence to stick through the trials and tribulations I think that's that's the ultimate that's the ultimate thing okay last question that we asked to all the founders we interview if you would could have any advice for young Marcos getting started out or anyone getting started out on a business what would it be I think the number one thing I would tell my younger self is play to your strengths and have the discipline to just stick it out because I think especially at first being an introvert and like I used to play video games and stuff like that I I used to try to do things I wasn't good at sales video streaming I tried all of it if I played to my strengths which is more introverted writing stuff like this I think that would have been a huge help and then again sticking to one thing having the discipline to focus and stick out all the failures that'd be my number one advice I would have succeeded 5 years earlier that's amazing well congrats on all your success man yeah thank you you're crushing it you as well follow this advice and you'll have a million dooll ghost writing business peace hey everyone Pat here thank you guys so much for watching I really hope marcos's story inspires and motivates some of you to get started on your own thing if you're curious about doing something similar but you're still looking for an idea well you can

TITLE: I Make $1M/Month From Bed
VIDEO ID: dphK9rh2F5U
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dphK9rh2F5U
================================================================================

this guy made $1 million a month selling bed sheets online and the crazy part is he literally does it from bed I work from bed all the time actually this is definitely the office I flew out to Denver Colorado to ask him exactly how he got started and the unconventional marketing strategy he uses to make millions of dollars a year I sponsor that I love and I sponsor that I watch before the money Colin worked three different full-time jobs but he couldn't keep any of them so he decided to start his own company and in the process found a special hack to make $284,000 in his first 30 days we got $450 customers at a $100 aov did $45,000 on day one and that snowballed into a $284,000 campaign in this video Colin shares his exact blueprints on how to build a million doll per month brand how to name a million doll per month brand and how to find and validate a million dooll business idea the easiest way to do it is to build a so they can really visualize and understand the company that they're building I'm Pat walls and this is starter story Colin great to meet you in person after all these years so it's awesome to see the growth of starter story thank you man thank you for having me tell me about yourself and what you built I am founder and CEO of sheets and giggles and if you haven't heard of us we sell bed sheets I Incorporated the company October 20177 shipped our first box in in October 2018 and then about 25 months later November 2020 we had our first million doll month at about $1.2 million in sales so it was pretty medior at the beginning yeah it's awesome yeah all right can you tell me a little bit more about your business and how it works sure so we're a directed consumer brand we sell mostly through our website sheets giggles.com which is a Shopify backend and then we also sell on Amazon at amazon.com sheets we do about 9010 or 8020 Shopify burs Amazon in terms of sales we started in 2018 with just sheets comforters and dubet covers and pillowcases since then we've added throw blankets pillows crib sheets mattress protectors and all stuff and we actually launched a mattress in 20 late 2022 we started with five colors and five sizes and now we have seven sizes and 17 colors and hundreds of skews and shipping 100 PB mattresses every day so it's crazy yeah all right Colin tell me a little bit more about your backstory how did you come to the point where you wanted to start your own company I've been fired twice and I've been laid off once um and it sucks every time no last week's pay have to buy back your laptop lose your health care I was like man like all my friends are in New York working at Banks like I can't believe I was just done with it I was I was super done working for other people I was so tired of having to take orders that I disagreed with and my friend gave a phone call it changed my life she said hey we're we're doing a Kickstarter for my wearable tech idea that I have do you want to help with it I said yeah sure I threw a launch party for her in Seattle that changed my life because the mentorship I got there is completely life-changing for someone especially in their 20s who's kind of directionless or or feels like they're directionless my best advice I can give people is do you think someone's going to be a good Mentor say Hey you have an hour a week that I can maybe spend with you and buy you lunch every week and ask you questions and that's exactly what I did I had three people that I bought lunch every week and I asked them as many questions as I could I've been working for myself for 6 and a half years and it's the best gift I've ever given myself how did you find the idea how did you come up with the idea for sheets and giggles and why did you decide to build it after working in direct consumer company and wearable technology I really wanted something that was a direct consumer brand and I really wanted something that be proud of something that was in a big space I carve my own nichan so I actually started to like write my business model before I knew what the product was for people who are thinking about starting a business if you have a problem other people have that problem too I think that logic is great and I think it's fine the question is whether or not they're willing to pay for a solution to that problem and so I really encourage people to build a business model first that they really feel strongly about that makes sense for them their skill set what they're best at in the world I think business model first product second or at least tweak your product to make sure it fits really well into the business model yeah instead of finding a problem find what I call founder market fit which is the business that fits the best within your existing skill sets and that's actually something we talk about on our Workshop that we run about how to find a million-dollar business idea idea which you should join if you go to the link in the description we talk about how to look at your own skills and your own passions to identify a potential problem that you can solve that you can turn into a million-dollar business it it's really that simple I think that people think that they have to have some like doorbuster like blisteringly intelligent novel never-before seen idea to start a business and that's just not true if people ask themselves what am I best in the world at it's a great place to start for like what business they should start yeah that's what I always say too yeah let's talk about that period of trying to figure things out you had this idea for sheets and Giggles how did you validate the idea the easiest way to do it is to build a brand identity map that should be the first thing that everybody does actually is a brand identity map so they can really visualize and understand the company that they're building it is also a great like foundation for everything that follows so those are the three things brand identity map financial model business model then take those three things or especially the financial model send it to people you respect and say hey like does this make sense am I forgetting about a cost somewhere am I am I charging too much and if the people that you respect are like hey I look at your financial model and yeah makes sense like I think you could you could do this once you get that first validation then you move on to trying to validate with actual customers and my advice to everyone is to sell before you build you can sell a wireframe you can sell an idea you can sell a signup form an email capture the simple steps are like build a tactile something that you can really promise them like a like a you know sign up now and on May 1st when we launch you'll get the best price that you'll ever lock into into for the best set of sheets you'll ever have for us we were selling a set for $100 but if they signed up first they get them for 69 bucks and we ended up capturing 11,000 emails 46% email capture then you send them surveys what colors do you want how much would you pay for this you get them involved and if you get people feeling like they're building a product with you they become emotionally invested in it and they're if they're not going to buy it they might share it with someone and be like check out this new product company launched that's the ultimate validation so yeah then once you get those sales you know people will pay for it yeah okay so you have this validation yep you have these people that are ready to buy they're ready to buy then you parlay that into massive sales tell me about those moments and how you did that if you want to do $100,000 campaign for example you need 30% of your total that you want your goal on day one that's how the crowdfunding math Works spikes plateaus little Spike at the end you then need on day one $30,000 300 customers at 100 bucks where do you get those customers from you get them from an email list you need 10,000 emails cuz an email list reasonably converts at about 3% 2% of you're doing something wrong 4% if you're doing something right I did the calculations I was like all right great we're going to do $70 price on day one 1 and a half units per order I assumed so about a $100 aov and I assumed that if our 10,000 person email L converted to 3% we get 300 customers $330,000 we were on our way to $100,000 campaign what ended up happening is our email is converted at 45% we got $450 customers at a $100 aov did $45,000 on day one and that snowballed into a $284,000 campaign and I attribute a lot of that to like the content that we were sending out it was so different than any email they'd ever gotten yeah I advise this to any founder listening is I had a one-on-one connection with thousands of people I answered every single social media comment myself I responded to every customer care email myself I you know wrote every email I wrote every word of copy on the website for years I can't recommend enough that Founders take the time to engage with people extremely personally on a on a granular level yeah so you launch you have this massive launch then how do you get to 1 million a month what's the special sauce of marketing things that work are like I think everyone's going to know works right Facebook Instagram Google Amazon ads all that has worked for years and it continues to work and then the ones that have worked that have surprised me have been the podcast channels I sponsor podcasts that I love and I sponsor YouTube channels that I watch if you the founder of your company and you love something you love a radio station you love a podcast you love a YouTuber odds are the people who also like them are like you they're going to resonate with your personality and a lot of your personality is going to come out in your brand so it all lines up you have viewers of people who are like you who are going to resonate with a brand that's like them that watch a channel that you speak the language of that you can make inside jokes for that you can write compelling copy with that you can build a whole landing page p in that brand voice the conversion rate on that is insane versus every other page on our website same with the content make sure the content makes you make sure the content's interesting to you betting is a crowded space and very boring um how have you differentiate yeah exactly how have you differentiated your brand and why has it made it successful I use my friends as models not just because they're cheaper which they are but also because I don't think that you can fake friendship and chemistry and so I always try to get stuff like that bleeds off the screen that just feels like you're in the room with us and overall the the ideology is you can't be everything for everyone so make sure that you're like at least something for someone if you're not pissing like at least 20% of people off you you're probably not doing it right for example one rule we have is we never iron the sheets the longest short of it is if it's been done before I don't want it I don't want to do it yeah let's talk about how you came up with the name for sheets and Giggles how' you come up with that well so I have four rules to a good brand name it has to be spell sharable and memorable that's one rule spell sharable and memorable rule number two it has to connote or denote what you do sheets and Giggles we Den knowe what we do we sell bed sheets rule number three is that you have to have good SEO around it try not to pick words or combinations of words where they find not you or worse a competitor and Rule Number Four is that if you're going to sell to Americans you got to have a do com because Americans don't buy from anything that's not a doom those are my four rules and if you have four for four you're a bullseye and if you're three for four go go forward if you're two for four two and a half nope try again that's epic so yeah Pat very important question would you like to get in the bed with me I don't know man we've been in bed together for 5 years all right interview from bed first time for everything I love it let's talk about the most bad thing you can imagine what tools do you use for your business so Shopify big one um of course Google analytics Google AdWords I love uh Reby for incard up cells I love after sell for post-p purchase upsells I really like okendo for our reviews so I use okendo we use a lot of shoing f apps tracking more for order tracking site gbt which is a chatbot for with AI that you can train on your website I really like this kid that built this he's one a solopreneur you should interview him actually we have actually wait the GPT guy oh he's so nice he's in our community dude he's super nice okay he's like some 20-year-old kid like just like dude he really nailed it with that and I'm really happy for him um it's like 50 bucks a month and it cut down our customer care tickets by like 30% um it's also our best salesman cuz we tell the AI bot if you have a great conversation with people and it's able to judge if it's a good conversation offer them code AI for 10% off and it's one of our best little discount codes that we use yeah it's great pays for itself and then I use uh stock IM for image creation as well as Dolly use a little bit of chat GPT for for blank page problem I really obsess over copy so I try not to use chat gbt for like copy copy but as someone with 88 HD like the blank page problem can be really overwhelming sometimes and so it's really nice to solve that problem yeah yeah I usually just tear it up anyway but yeah let's talk about uh Team what does your team look like well we have on a daily basis about 40 people who touch the business and that's everyone from Logistics and warehousing to uh Amazon ad agencies to Performance Marketing agencies affiliate agencies full-time folks in marketing in product and operations in customer care we work with tons of folks I think my favorite people people that are part of our team are the folks at Mile High Workshop here in Denver it helps lower our local recidivism rates and our local homelessness rates and it's one of my favorite things that that we do on our team is have those folks a part of it cool yeah tell me about the day in the life of Colin day in the life of someone building multi-million dollar business from home I work from bed all the time actually um this is definitely the office but I think everyone can tell you four walls start closing in after a while when you're in the same space so I love working from the river I go out there with Harvey my little Jack Russell I sit right in the water up to my chest and I put my laptop on a rock I set up hot spot and I just work from the river and I do that probably like 3 days a week in the summer wow and it is the best it's the most healing mental Wellness thing that I can recommend from someone is to spend more time Outdoors look man I'm I'm slacking I'm sending emails and I'm on the phone whether I'm in the water or I'm in my bed or I'm in the office you know so my job is mostly at this point meetings coordination followups analytics and Reporting and then you know content creation as well which really helps to get into a new environment to be more creative last question if you could sit on Colin shoulder when you you know work in that full-time job when you were laid off what advice would you give to him what what advice would you give to someone like that it's not fun shouldn't be glorified but I would tell myself as a 25 26 27-year-old kindness plus hard work plus intelligence leads to good things and you're kind and smart so keep working hard and eventually it'll it'll pay off stay with it yeah thank you man dude thank you for inviting me this is amazing the company you built thank you follow this advice and you will have a multi-million dollar bed sheet eucalyptus comp it's very easy don't don't let anybody tell you different super super easy all right guys I hope you got some good nuggets from Colin story that you can apply to your own business but if you're feeling a bit stuck and maybe you don't have an idea yet or you just want to go deeper on how to actually make your first dollar well I got something special for you I'm hosting a free workshop for all of our

TITLE: I Make $5M/Year With 3 Businesses
VIDEO ID: zTKYJWAEl78
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTKYJWAEl78
================================================================================

this guy makes over $5 million a year running three different businesses and the crazy part is he started from nothing I flew out to Denver Colorado to ask him exactly how he got started how he runs all these businesses at the same time and the marketing strategy he used to go from Zer to 22 million with his first business we generated and still generate a lot of our leads to Tim started out as a solopreneur he was all in on one business but this business had a problem the more it grew the more hours he had to work every day then one day he stumbles onto an opportunity that would change everything he decided to become a multipreneur the big goal is to build a portfolio of assets that essentially do all the hard work for me in this video Tim will share how he built a team to run his $5 million portfolio of businesses how to find and close big clients and the best best business model to start as a beginner I still think it's the best business for somebody to start I'm Pat walls and this is starter story all right Tim what's up buddy thank you for having me sure thanks for being here in your amazing House in Denver Colorado tell me about who you are and everything you built great well my name is Tim Stoddard I own an SEO lead generation agency called stazzi internet marketing this year uh for stazzy we'll do probably like 2 and A5 million but uh on the side and more and more throughout the day I I find myself running a personal Holdings company my guess is it'll be like 5.2 to 5 A5 million for 2024 amazing can you break down each of the different businesses that you run within your holding company sure stazzi internet marketing is the main driver of everything else that generates like the cash and the revenue to make all the other stuff go subsequently to stazzi is recovery local that's sort of the parent company that own owns sober.com your first step.com detox.com and medically assistant.com then there's copy blogger.com so copy blogger teaches people how to write for the internet how to build newsletters how to do SEO on websites how to write on LinkedIn so I've I've built up equity in like five or six other companies over the last couple years but those three are the main ones so you have all these different companies what's the Big Goal what's the strategy of running different multiple companies well the big goal is to build a portfolio of assets that I had a real like click moment like oh wow I don't have to just work for a paycheck every week I can use the money I make through stazzy through my agency reinvest it into Cash flowing assets and eventually build up a portfolio where the businesses the company themselves just do the hard work for me I just made up my mind to do it I've been doing it ever since yeah can you give me a timeline of how you got started and how how you got into the business of Entrepreneurship I grew up a bluecollar kid I built houses for most of my childhood my dad worked at the airport and my mom was a nurse and so I just thought I'd be working my whole life got in trouble a lot when I was younger and I had a bit of a drug problem so the time came when I needed to change my life and I went to rehab and and I got sober about 6 months into that Journey a friend basically a mentor bought me a subscription to Success magazine which had this CD in it and it was this interview and it was guy named Seth Goden he said start a blog don't tell anybody about it and write in it every day and there was something about that message where I thought like you know what I can do that I don't know why it felt like it was a good direction for me but I just I knew I could do that so I I started a blog spot and I would just write random articles about like my day and what I was feeling and experiences I had and there was other people that might have been getting sober might have been going through a journey of themselves and they were saying like oh I really relate to this or like I felt the same way but I was wondering how are these people finding my blog like I didn't tell anybody about it so I started researching and I discovered SEO I discovered search and then I would read copy blogger every day and just improve my skills of of being an online writer and yeah eventually that blog spot account turned into subnation and and that's how I got my start yeah I love that you found this skill of writing because actually writing was one of my skills that helped me build starter story and what's amazing about starter story is there are thousands of case studies on Founders who had some sort of skill like writing or coding or design they were able to take that one skill and turn it into a business that changed their lives if you're looking to take your skills and passions and turn it into an online business you should check out our Workshop that we're running where I share the story about how I turned my skills which was actually writing into a million-dollar business how I found that business idea how I executed on that and built that business on two hours a day while I had a full-time job if you're curious about learning more about that you can find the first link in the description and uh save a seat for yourself see you there all right so you got this blog people are reading your blog they're commenting how do you turn this into a business all of the sudden with sobern nation treatment centers and Behavioral Healthcare centers were reaching out to me saying like how did you build this community how did you build this audience and so we took the traffic that was coming from sober nation and almost turned it into like a a lead generation media Outlet I remember got my first client it was 2,000 bucks a month and we just kept doing it and doing it and doing it and it's it's scaled ever since give me a little bit more of a breakdown about how you built it so you had your first client then then what did you do from there we generated and still generate a lot of our leads through SEO it was one keyword in particular that I ranked for it was just drug rehab marketing and then we started writing for drug rehab SEO drug rehab lead generation so if there's like one message that somebody can get from me it's that you don't have to build this giant media entity like you can tackle it one keyword one article at a time the trick is to be methodical about it that's why I hate the advice like just make great stuff just be yourself it's just being yourself is like terrible SEO advice what you want to do is you want to know what people are searching for you can figure that out just by going to trends. google.com type in a bunch of keywords see what keywords are available and then write an article that best solves the particular problem that that person has I always think of Google as a problem solving machine you never go to Google for anything else other than to solve a problem and so if you can write an article that best solves that person's problem you can generate leads and then on sudden you can build a business yeah can you tell me the pros and cons of building and running this agency agencies are great because there's no real upstart Capital you don't have to build anything you just need to get a client and then all of a sudden you're a profitable business they're hard because they're difficult to scale so like every new client you bring in you know you have to do more work you have to onboard them you know every like two or three or four clients or however many you got to hire another employee right but nonetheless I still think it's the best business for somebody to start because you just need a client once you get your first client all of a sudden you have a profitable business so yeah let's talk about sales and closing deals do you have any tips on negotiation and how to close a deal there's only a couple things you need to know about closing deals one is learn how to ask questions so that the person tells you their pain points you want the person to tell you their problems when that's happening I just write down what the person says I write down the problem and I respond with a a solution to that problem the second most important thing is is to get like the the price out of the way in the very beginning because what always happens you go through this whole pitch and then people say okay I'll call you back let me think about it and that's the worst thing that can happen so I always start a conversation by saying like hey love just do me a favor and let me know if you're serious about this that way you get like a commitment and you actually get the deal closed and then the last and absolutely most important thing is ask for the deal here's my line for this it's the best line it's are you ready to get started that's all you got to say you say are you ready to get started and the trick is you shut up so what I do is I say are you ready to get started and then I mute my phone and I put it in front of me and I just sit there and that's where you close the deal so you build this agency it's profitable it's generating cash then you start buying businesses can you tell me more about what that looked like the first one was a company called moving local again like a lead generation site people buy moving leads a lot I built another one called stem cell Authority which was lead generation for the stem cell industry I've recently invested in a company called Kaa which is an AI content creation tool it's mainly for SEO it's an SEO tool I was one of the founding investors in a company called spark loop it's a a way for people to build their email list it works with beehive and it works with convertkit there's a website called your Boulder which I bought which is a newsletter that goes out to the people of of Boulder Colorado there's another SEO agency called digital Commerce we saw a big opportunity to do SEO for people that want to build email lists and sell digital products or sell courses or sell ebooks or subscriptions whatever the case may be so we have another agency and then most recently I just invested in a company called Hey Creator so hey Creator is kind of like a Creator Studio you could call it of people that are all trying to build these creator-driven businesses and then of course I bought copy blogger that's going really well but I'm still running recovery local and I'm still running my agency that's really where I spend most of my time so you're running and have equity in multiple companies at the same time what are some of the pros and cons of running multiple companies well the cons is more mental sometimes I think about how much more simple my life would be if I just had one thing to focus on and I didn't have to keep track of so much stuff in my mind the pros are that I love hearing new ideas I love researching New Opportunities and so that keeps me like really engaged and I really think that investing in private businesses especially investing in cash flowing businesses that's just a great way to make sure your money keeps growing on itself and going on itself all right let's talk about tools and software that you run multiple businesses on what are your favorite ones well slack is a must it's just a a great communication tool especially now that we're all over the country underutilized is Loom like Loom is the best you can just get your idea out one time and people don't have to stop what they're doing to know what it is that you need to tell them to doist is great for me is the simplest task management tool but I write down all the tasks that I need to assign I record Loom videos and then I assign them on todoist and then that's it the rest of the day takes care of itself although it's the most expensive HubSpot in my opinion is definitely the best CRM it makes it easy to keep track of your leads to keep track of your network and then click up I think if you're running a real established agency to doist isn't going to be enough it's just not robust enough and so toist is really where I manage my personal Holdings company but clickup is where sty runs that's like our our real task management software so slack todoist Loom HubSpot and clickup and then of course Google Drive like sometimes we laugh that basically every tool that anybody makes is just like a modified version of of Google Sheets and Google Docs and so like yeah Google Drive is a must so your goal is to build these self-sustaining businesses and now you have a team how was it going from just a solo preneur to building a team I had access to a lot of young people that were just getting into recovery I hired them like straight out of halfway houses and we've all built this together over the last 10 years so in terms of managing a team read the e- myth Revisited that book changed my life I just realized that I am in the way of everything I am literally the biggest problem in the company and the best thing I can do for the company is document processes be organized about it teach and then get the hell out of the way because I don't do anything except mess things up when I get in the middle of it so read the emth and read it again again and then read it a third time and take notes on it and just do everything that book says and you'll be fine yeah so you've invested in tons of businesses and you built tons of businesses how do you approach finding great business ideas and knowing when to invest and when to not invest in a company there's only three things that I really care about one do I like the founder because if I don't like the person it doesn't matter how great the idea is like life is too short to deal with people that you don't like two is it cash flowing I personally am not interested in betting on a thousand companies and hoping that like one of them turns the Facebook I want to build a portfolio of assets and then the third one this is just for me personally is is it like ever green I want to find something that's going to be around forever right that's why Healthcare is appealing to me because people are always going to need to take care of themselves so that's it like is the founder cool does it cash flow and is it Evergreen and if it meets those criteria I'll take it seriously all right let's talk about what a day in the life looks like for you what are you doing these days all my days look exactly the same I've always woken up very early so I'm usually up at like 4:00 chug some water I get a cup of coffee I sit on my computer I record my assignments for the day by that time my kids used to wake up I play with them I take them to school around 8:00 and then my wife I go to the gym I'm in the gym every day from 8:30 to 10:00 I come back I eat and uh then I work the afternoon is usually deal making so the mornings for me is like Logistics and task assignment and the afternoon is is deal making so I follow up with my leads I make phone calls I write proposals I write contracts if I close a deal I do all the onboard and uh then my kids get home at like 5: we hang out down here and we play and we eat dinner and I watch [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] True Detective like I do the same thing every day my life is super boring throughout your journey building businesses you've been doing this for a while now what have been some of the struggles or have there anything that's been hard in your journey the hardest part about being an entrepreneur is that I worry all the time most of my time is just spent like what's about to go wrong what's a fire that's about to happen like where can I see something coming so that I'm not blindsided and my life doesn't like Fall to Pieces because of some problem that I couldn't control so like yeah I worry a lot every morning as soon as I wake up I'm thinking like what's wrong what's wrong what's wrong it's just it's really difficult to make that go away yeah if you could sit on the shoulder of yourself when you're just getting started just getting started with that blog what would be your advice to Young Tim when I was getting sober basically the fear is always how am I ever going to have fun for the rest of my life or like what am I going to do when I'm at a wedding and then somebody told me all you ever have to do is get through the day so you make it till midnight and then what do you do when midnight comes you just make it to midnight again and like it never ever ends the solution to every problem in my life is always like I'm just going to get through the day I'm just going to make it till midnight so I really really truly live my life like one day at a time I don't think too far into the future I have no idea what's coming next I just I I make it till midnight one day at a time that's great advice thanks thank you man thank you for having us of course follow this advice and you will have five companies making $5 million a year hey guys I hope you enjoyed the breakdown of all of Tim's businesses it's amazing story right if you want to do something similar but you're struggling to find the right idea or the time to build it well I have something that might help you I'm hosting a free Workshop this week to show you exactly how I validated my own million dooll business and then exactly how I built that business on Just 2 hours a day while I had a full-time job because I know from personal experience there's nothing worse than wanting to start a business but not feeling 100% confident that you're on the right track so if you're interested

TITLE: I Built A $1M App In 5 Hours
VIDEO ID: u8sW-NhGfXw
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8sW-NhGfXw
================================================================================

this is Dawson and he built a million doll Pere crypto app all by himself and the crazy part is he built it in less than a day I basically went and start to finish I think four or 5 hours total he invited us into his van home in Colorado to show us exactly how we built this thing and the viral marketing strategy that got him 10,000 organic signups in just 48 Hours what I really leaned into was but there was a problem all of those users didn't pay him a single dollar then Dawson came up with a genius monetization strategy that scaled him to over $100,000 a month yes so I came with this idea of an anti- email strategy in this video Dawson will share the exact ideation marketing and monetization blueprints he used to build a $1 million app as a solo developer I'm Pat walls and this is starter story Dawson thanks for having me we're in your Sprinter van right now in Boulder Colorado tell me about who you are and what you built yeah of course thanks for having me uh my name is Dawson I am a solo preneur software engineer I made a company called nfy and nnfi helps ethereum users find and claim money they didn't know they had I grew Eary to over 250,000 uh free users 5,000 paid users and that was over a million dollars ARR and then had a liquidity event took my exit and moved into this van doing a little exploring doing a little Consulting but mostly just skiing nice tell me a little bit more about nfy this web 3 startup that you built if you're a user of ethereum you're going all over the place investing in things trading swapping voting in governance but you don't know about these things called aird drops now aird drops are like coupons it's like uh hey come use this thing we'll give you an airdrop free money honestly so N5 is just a very simple website if you put in your ethereum address on the homepage you're going to get instant results of what are your unclaimed airdrops and it's very common to get hundreds or thousands of dollars in these if you're even moderately active in ethereum the average user over the course of the entire website was getting $750 by being a customer all right let's talk about your backstory what were you doing that led you to starting this amazing business really when I was a kid I was I was really into video games and I was really into just being a dork honestly with math and science and that really paid out well in middle school I had a friend who taught me how to start programming I wrote these programs that actually helped us cheat on our geometry tests people started plugging and sharing the program that was my first taste of you know like product Market fit and having people like the thing you code or build but that path was not very straightforward for me so when I was a student I actually lost a lot of interest in software the degree found a way to kind of take the excitement away for me after my first 2 years I I wanted to drop out but instead of dropping out I got a taste of hackathons hackathons I think are so fun because it gives you the opportunity not just to create something fast but also you can build products that real people use you can build things that real people want if you do it right you can put on a website and have real users at the end of the weekend yeah and I was addicted from then on really on uh understanding that software could go change the world yeah so you were working as software engineer at Uber and some other big Tech Healthcare companies what was that experience like yeah working at a company like uber obviously the salary is pretty lucrative from the outside it's a booming successful startup I was there in 2016 I was there preo that was the hot place to be and yet while there I I just saw the downsides of large corporations just ineffective teams honestly and that was a bit sad to be a part of cuz I really want to make direct change in this world and so in addition to just being disillusioned with big Tech then I was also disillusioned with kind of the office space and just not wanting to show up every day I needed to get a break and get away so what I did actually is I left and I just Nomad I just traveled the world for a year and I I almost just had to reach the point of like I don't need software for now I'm just going to be a nomad I'm just going to travel and and do yoga and see the world you know what was that experience like of deciding to quit and and drop everything and and go do this Nomad thing how did you feel in that time yeah so I felt really scared I felt really worried to kind of step out of that Comfort this was a pretty risky move to leave not just a great startup but also to leave San Francisco I felt like all of software existed there but during that year of travel I met some folks in Australia who were Distributing financial aid for nonprofits through ethereum and it was just the the most Niche Out of This World experience to cross paths with those folks while being outside of San Francisco and and outside of the tech bubble they almost like pulled me back in to realize technology can be used for good technology be can be impactful and that got me really interested all over again in in software in ethereum and making something in crypto yeah what happens next how do you come up with the idea for NY when I came back to the US it took me over a year to kind of reassimilate to being in the US being American and knowing that I wanted to base my life here as I did that I just started competing in more and more of these hackathons was a 1 month long hackathon and crypto was popping off it was getting very hot as a user in this community I knew the pain points I already knew which problem I wanted to solve but I love waiting until the ideas are really clear and so sometimes I'll take the first two or 3 weeks of a month-long hackathon just letting the ideas bounce around in my brain so that when I do hit the computer I have tons of conviction once I have that conviction the idea just flows a lot more easily and that's what happened here is that I waited till till almost the last second from then it was just building the solution I needed once I hit the hit the code base and started writing this I basically went start to finish I think four or five hours total wow Dawson is proof that just one person can start a million-- dooll business in just a few hours but that comes with knowing the right information and finding the right problem to solve now imagine there was a place that gave you all this the problems to solve the blueprints to solve them and the strategies that turn simple ideas into million-dollar online businesses well at starter story we have a library of over 4,000 case studies and business idea breakdowns where you can access this all backed by data from real entrepreneurs so if you're serious about building a profitable side project head to the first link in the description and we're going to give you 50 solo developer ideas just like Dawson's so you can get started on your journey now let's get back to how Dawson actually launched this business peace so you build this thing in basically 5 hours in the hackathon and it starts taking off can you tell me more about that yeah I shipped the website put it on a public URL and Publishing this tweet that just went super viral about the website crafted this tweet just really intentionally I I included a nice little video of how the the searching worked for an address that had a ton of airdrops for it so of course it's kind of teasing folks letting them know this is what's possible out there and I think there was almost a bit of a charitable feeling where folks were like I want to help other people find the money they didn't know they had also hitting retweet was such an easy thing to do I had 10,000 organic signups at the end of that 48 hours wow and how did you get those signups yes I got those signups by optimizing this page for the call to actions to sign up for the email both in the header and in just a massive button above the fold using drop shadows and borders properly to draw the user's eyes towards these buttons it felt incredible I almost was was losing faith before that is you know I've always been shipping stuff but never had that many eyes on what I've what I've built I thought you had to be already at the top to get eyes on your your content but I realized if you just add a lot of value for people that you can rise to the top that way as well yeah so you got this app it's getting a bunch of free users how does this turn into a thing that makes a million dollars ARR I came up with this idea of an anti- email strategy and this is just rooting from the fact that I hate getting spam emails and so I just never sent an email unless the email was you have matched this amount of money you have this to go claim the open rate was through the roof just everyone wanted to always open these emails if they got one and then what I just did is I decided one day every single airdrop from now on is going to be pay walled so you'll see okay you have $793,000 so a lot of crypto people hang out on Twitter and I used to do these really kitchy fun campaigns where I did one called 25 Days of Christmas every single day for 25 days I would tag someone publicly on Twitter and say the amount of dollars they had unclaimed with a screenshot it was basically saying like you're an idiot if you don't go claim this and they would be tagging them and all that yeah even there' be this community pressure that was actually healthy of other people seeing it being like why wish I had that to go claim I also just became a fiend for going to conferences showing up in person and letting people know about what I was building led to even more signups as well cool but yeah crypto is a crowded space anyone could build an app like this technically how did you differentiate nfy the thing that made NY so different is just how obsessive I was about quality and that led to this really good reputation again where if someone got a notification they knew it was a high dollar value that they could go claim right then and any competitors who were trying they were including too much that too much led to lower quality and then people didn't trust and trust is so big because of how much hacking and fishing there is within crypto yeah another part is just being early that's not always advice you can replicate but if you can that's obviously going to be helpful you can be first to the scene and then provide so much quality that no one can even catch up yeah so you built this as a solo developer as a solo preneur tell me what that experience was like yeah SOLO has a lot of pros and a lot of cons one of the pros is you get to take it where you want you don't have to ask permission and you get to ship to users directly any team is going to slow you down a bit on that yeah but of course the cons are it can be lonely you can also think something's a great idea when it's not and so you got to stay around in communities if you can I did a bit of co-working at the time and these conferences I mentioned in order to bounce off ideas from other people and make sure I wasn't just in an echo chamber in my head yeah you're a software engineer what are your favorite tools and coding languages what do you build with yeah finally the best part so what I love to code in is typescript I use typescript full stack we've got no js on the back end we've got react on the front end and I pull this all together with a framework called nextjs so nextjs makes really fast websites having speed and having all of this website just load so fast for everyone was also part of what helped me grow I'm a Big Mac guy I have a maxed out MacBook Pro I have a split keyboard just super nerdy I can get good posture and just a huge 32 31in monitor to make sure that my eyes are resting all day as well for code editor I use vs code anyone out there who does typescript knows that's probably going to be the best choice anyways so you got this successful profitable business and then something crazy happens can you tell me about that so I got a Twitter DM from from David Hoffman he one of the podcasters and this large podcast called bankless I had been watching and listening to bankless for years in fact bankless helped me get into ethereum I had a bucket list item that was to get my name mentioned on Bank list not only did I get my name mentioned but I ended up being the CTO and so it just a dream come true but I never considered the acquisition route until they reached out and I realized how realistic that was we talked for several months about some of the specifics and yeah after 2 years of growing the company alone it was acquired by bankless you sell your company you have this life-changing event tell me what that experience was like yeah I felt like there was a huge celebration but then right after that kind of wears off the dopamine wears off it's a bit of a freef fall feeling this used to be your passion it used to be how you spend every day and then after that you've got to discover what your new meaning is going to be I feel that a bit with with travel with Fitness with skiing with this van when you say that it sounds like the dream oh of course I want to ski seven days a week of course I want to go wherever I want whenever I want but actually that's not the dream it only took me a couple weeks to really feel how dark that could be cuz yeah you can SK every day but what you're spending 7 Days alone up in the mountains you're not sharing experiences with other people and it turns out a lot of my meaning is through Community it's through social stuff it's through spending time with people and making memories with people do you see yourself starting another company or doing work or are you working now I do yeah so I see myself as a serial entrepreneur this is just one of hopefully many and at the moment I have started some Consulting I'm really doing a lot of Open Source projects as well back on Twitter again I'm also on farcast which is this website that is a decentralized social media platform and so just publishing and building in public is is already what I've started doing again all right well you're living this van life right now tell me what a day in the life like is for you living out of this van working and skiing yeah A Day in the Life is you know I manage spending time with friends and I manage spending time up in the mountains and I man manage a little bit of time on the computer so I kind of balance these three things besides that I spend a lot of time at either co-working spaces putting myself around other people or going to these meetups making sure I'm still around these ideas a lot but really doing it from a different place mentally because I want to I'm doing it for the fun of it I'm not doing it cuz I have to find customers or I have to find the next idea necessarily yeah that's great okay one final question if you could sit on Dawson's shoulder when you were you know a software engineer at Uber kind of really trying to figure out what you wanted to do when you're a digital Nomad uh what advice would you have for him yeah if I were to talk to my old self I think I would just say Enjoy the process more I wouldn't want to change what got me to today anything that seems like a misstep was actually something that taught me a lot but it's just that during that process don't have as much anxiety don't have as much worry cuz it will all work out you know like look at me now it pned out pretty well all right man well thank you thank you for having us follow this advice and you'll build a million dooll ethereum airdrop app hey guys Pat here I really hope Dawson's story inspires you and motivates some of you to go ahead and start your own thing if you're curious about doing something similar but you're still looking for an idea well

TITLE: I Make $1M/Year With One Website
VIDEO ID: 7LZ0MTkNr34
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LZ0MTkNr34
================================================================================

this is Alex and he makes over a million dollars a year with a business model that nobody's talking about anymore a affiliate marketing he invited us into his house in California to show us his exact websites and how he built them on just a few hours a day while working a full-time job yeah the aha moment for me in terms of unlocking my side hustling and and my ability to build a business was but Alex's website made $0 for months until one day he covered something about the Google algorithm that changed everything if you're building a business that relies on SEO you want to go after in this video we'll dive into how to build a business while you have a full-time job niches that make $100,000 a month and the secret strategy that Alex used to grow to a million dollars a year the smart kind of innovative moment for us was the idea of just directly I'm Pat walls and this is starter story well Alex nice to meet you thank you for having me in your lovely home yeah tell me about who you are and what you built I'm Alex I am the founder of fin versus.com it's a popular product review site that helps visitors on the web compare different health and wellness options it's now a seven fig Revenue business started the business as a side hustle in 2018 and and never looked back yeah what is the actual business model how does it work we drive Shoppers to Brands I make Partnerships with those Brands and every time somebody buys something referred from our site on one of those partner sites we make a a commission of some kind yeah so you're essentially a middleman between Shoppers and these Brands that's right y totally so you started Finn versus Finn while you had a full-time job can you tell me that story both of my parents were entrepreneurs I kind of knew from day one that that was always my dream my idea right out of college was hey why don't I go work with some early stage Founders and eventually have an idea and meet meet enough people and build enough skills to to be successful as an entrepreneur but what I found in my life as a marketer at early stage companies is that it's not a 90 to five it's it's really that you're sort of having a Founder mentality in order to be successful a big aha moment for me was this idea that hey I I need a true 9 to5 I need to be able to close my work laptop at 5 so that I can side hustle and and and you know find a path for my own entrepreneurship really the key to that was working at a larger company now you got this more chill work life balance tell me how you get the idea for Finn versus Finn and what does the journey look like from there I was working at a fin tech company at the time the first iteration of a of a product review product comparison site was just that stupid like fintech fin versus Fin and so we were going to compare fintech companies quickly saw $100 million series A's Venture funding going to a wide range of tele medicine companies and thinking huh there's there's no content online about that and that's a pretty considered purchase you know if you're going to buy a medical product how are you going to make that decision by yourself how do I know which one to go trust so it's sort of like scratching our own itch there in terms of what kind of content to write but yeah I wrote the first 60 articles myself I didn't hire anyone learning WordPress at the same time that's where the the site is was built typically in the beginning we would drive traffic through organic SEO kind of anticipating the series of products or queries that Shoppers might be making online you know what are Shoppers searching for essentially is the first question and you can meet that Demand with content the the smart kind of innovative moment for us was the idea of just partnering with Brands directly I'd say it took us about 6 months before we saw a significant amount of organic traffic where I felt comfortable starting to reach out to the brands that we were driving traffic to and had enough confidence to say I'm pretty sure we're driving you sales I don't see those numbers on my end but there could be more um if if we work together it's a pretty compelling pitch and they name their price in terms of the customers that you're willing to drive so at this point uh the the numbers the revenue is starting to seem shockingly good unbelievable yeah when you when you first have that aha moment like this this could be a business and um imagine what could happen when you step on the gas yeah you're starting to make some money you're starting to balance do I still work my full-time job do I not what does that look like what does that Journey look like for you so at some point um you know maybe a full year in I felt like my income was being replaced it could be replaced at the same time I think there's a fear or there was a fear for me around is this legitimate and will this last and how foolish if you quit your day job and it doesn't really last for very long and and then where are you you know so I think at that point I just said okay one year we'll see and if the lights are still on in a year um then this is super fun and and I could see myself doing this full-time yeah how much were you making from Finn versus Finn at the time that you're working a full-time job I guess I didn't feel comfortable making that switch until my income was replaced so I was making 150k in salary so that's kind of my own personal earnings from the site when I felt comfortable making the switch Yeah my favorite part about Alex's story is that he didn't quit his full-time job until he was making $150,000 with this new side project and just like Alex I actually did this same thing I started a million-dollar business while I had a full-time job but it wasn't easy it required having the right idea in a solid execution plan in place if you're curious about doing something similar and you have a full-time job well we're running a free workshop on how to build a million-dollar business on Just 2 hours a day we'll talk about how to overcome self-doubt how to find a million-dollar business idea and exactly how to execute on that idea on Just 2 hours a day head to the first link in the description to save your seat we have just a limited number of spots see you there back to the video peace you guys really weren't making money for months can you tell me about the Breakthrough moment where you started to realize that this could be a business we identified the opportunity for health and wellness and that was like a a bullseye right we were amongst the first in the world to to review some of these tele health and tele medicine platforms which are now public and household names and and super common so I feel like you know in some sense that is the secret sauce figuring out a niche that is not super Crow cred you can't win in a crowded space when you're when you're young and and new and your site isn't authoritative on any level but you can win queries that nobody has ever written something for so generally if you're huning for ideas that meet that criteria I would say it has to be new and there has to be sort of high margin in that product category and there has to be kind of a lot of activity or momentum that will keep it going a space where no one has talked about those things but it has a lot of potential because it's tried and true at the end of the day it's not going to just be here and an end what does your keyword research process look like from starting to research the keywords and then writing the articles in the early days if you're going to if you're building an SEO a business that relies on SEO you want to go after low competition longtail keywords if you're in the audience that you're trying to serve you they might be just super intuitive to you there's query patterns as well that you start to recognize um that are high intent if you have the pattern it's just about fitting in the product or the brand or best this for that in the early days it was mostly focusing on the brands that we wanted to cover so okay this is a space we want to be in or maybe we've already written about and we have some Traction in okay so who are the players in that space who do we actually think is going to be here in 3 years and then strive to write the very best thing online about that brand sometimes that means going more in depth than the article that's number one on Google sometimes it means being more concise and and more to the point it's just what is the true intent behind the query that somebody typed in and how well does that piece of content that you're creating meet that intent that's how you wi be there first write the first thing online about it and write the best thing so everything's going great you're gaining traction you're building this business what happens next I decide to go full-time at the business after about 2 years my business partner who I started the business with didn't want to forego his career and sort of always wanted this to be a side hustle which at the time I very much respected it's where we started it was our agreement the solution to that really was me buying him out now on the second run I think I'll have more confidence to do it myself but I still very much value the contributions of a partner but I think I also would be just more choosy and and um more long-term oriented when I think about the skills that we each bring to the table Yeah tell me more a little bit more about what you'd be looking for in a partner you just want somebody who who who matches your intensity and shares your vision and hopefully also has some skills that are uh not just pure overlap with yours yeah if you were to meet someone a potential partner and you have some alignment on Vision The Next Step would be hey maybe we just see how we work together on some small projects feel it out and if it's right then Double Down double down and pretty soon you you will either see traction or need to formalize or both yeah Finn versus Finn is not your only uh website you built you decided to uh build actually a portfolio of affiliate marketing websites when did you decide to do that and what does that look like so we have about six sites in the portfolio total and they tend to focus on more Niche or more narrow Focus than just general health and wellness and all things tele medicine the reason I did that is because you have economies of scale when it comes to your Partnerships if you have one partner you can put them on five sites that was the idea there in terms of adding sites to the portfolio affiliate marketing might be one of the most competitive side hustles you can start in terms of anyone can start it how do you differentiate and how do you think about competition the expectation that you're going to be able to stay at top of Google forever I think is is wildly not true you're going to be competing with other people in your Niche other experts and authoritative websites as well as big Publishers that go after everything under the Sun so I think Forbes in Myspace health line but you can always serve your partners with net new content even as your past Money Maker content starts to erode as as your rankings start to erode stale content at the end of the day will will not win on Google so it needs to be fresh and it needs to be within your area of expertise that from Google's perspective not going too far outside of your lane topical Authority or kind of Niche what I think is really cool about your business is that you're not just doing organic search you actually have dabbled a bit in paid advertising can you tell me about that trying to diversify the the traffic is definitely something that every online entrepreneur should be thinking about realizing that you could go to your partners and say hey I know you want more growth I have an idea for more growth it's outside of the realm of what we normally do and it will cost you know a test spend of a few a few thousand do something like that and it very well may fail and fall on its face but we will be stronger and we'll have learn something for it and the upside is is that if it works it's extremely scalable it's actually scalable to the moon and [Music] pushed out further cuzz no one else is going to do that work running an affiliate business what does the team look like and what were some of like the first hires you made or some of the big hires you made for the business the first thing that we outsourced was writing after that was hiring a virtual assistant to sort of um take on a lot of the publishing tasks from there one of the biggest decisions was hiring an editor full-time taking the editing off my plate and then additionally we've added a designer to the team and a web developer that gives me enough space to just really focus on the part parterships which is where I feel my interest is as well as the ability to have the most leverage from from a revenue perspective what is a typical day in a life look like for an affiliate marketer in 2024 so I really start my work day probably around um 8:30 or 9 maybe I might have a weekly meeting um with some of my team members sort of set the agenda for for the week I likely have a few meetings on my calendar with with Brands themselves um to discuss how we're continuing to expand their partnership and and the the customers that we're driving to them I likely you know stop for lunch and and you know head out out of my little dark office in my H in my home hop back on my computer to either review content tweak some ad campaigns of some kind you know we do have a paid media strategy it's a big part of the business I typically stop working around 4 which is when our our the help for my son leaves and I don't do a lot of of work on the weekends anymore but I do have a nice window after sort of evening family time when I after I put my son to sleep where I I can have a few interrupted hours to respond to emails and make sure that folks on my team who are distributed across the world have their next steps for the next day essentially yeah you built this awesome business what's next I'm actually uh working on selling the business and finding it a new home so I think it's important to understand your purpose for the business is it just about the lifestyle and you actually don't care about how much money you make is it something that I see myself working in or yourself working in for the remainder of your life or is it something that you know has a short period of time that you want to be running it but you ultimately want to have an exit so thinking through those and and then um which corporate structure which functions you take on yourself and what you Outsource I think is are key considerations yeah if you could stand on Alex's shoulder and give him some advice on some of those things what would you say one of the key things that I've learned in this process is you can try and engineer the outcome as much as possible from the gecko but the reality of the situation is that you can't see around very many corners and you're going to have to Pivot a bunch so my key piece of advice to anyone who wants to own a business one day and start it and be the entrepreneur is to just get started um because where you start is not going to be where you end by by any means just pick a broad-based audience and start trying to figure out what their problems are and how you can help them but it doesn't need to be more engineered than that you don't need to be thinking about this being um a business that's going to be multi-generational or IPO or it doesn't even have to be business necessarily that you're hoping to sell one day it's important just to get started and figure out the pieces once you have a bit of momentum thank you man yeah follow this advice and you will be a million dollar affiliate marketer peace that was great

life sold all my belongings quit my job bought this like $2,000 van on Craigslist I flew out to his Warehouse in California to get his story and ask him how he got his first sale and the marketing strategy he used to go from $5,000 a month to $500,000 a month getting good good at marketing the sales just go nuts Jeremy started his journey trying tons of different business ideas but none of them made any money then one day he discovered a secret that led him to making $5,000 in a single day well we've always strive for us and that's where you could start to like make more money than Ecom in this video the van man breaks down how to find new million doll product ideas his simple blueprint to generate a million dollar a month and the number one platform he would choose if he had to start all over I think he the best place to start I'm Pat walls and this is starter story Jeremy right Jeremy yeah yeah thanks for having me man tell me a little bit about what you built and who you are my name is Jeremy um also known as van Man online in 2021 we started a natural alternatives business with toothpaste and and balms we try to make natural alternatives to everyday products it's like a simplified van life version of a product we started just like a $5,000 month I think our first month and then we've had like our first million dollar month that we did over 5 million last year so you started the van man while you're working a full-time job can you tell me more about that um so it started just kind of down on my luck like wanted to reset my life sold all my belongings quit my job bought this like $2,000 van on Craigslist only spend time working trying to like really get my energy back that I lost from these startups I had an account called van man on Twitter so I would post about random things like health things sometimes I got big into like anti fluoride so I bought some Florida toothpaste on accident I just wanted to like swear off toothpaste so instead of like making my own I just bought a box of baking soda and like dip my toothbrush in and just brush with baking soda baking sod is like harsh it's super salty so after a while I just started adding stuff to it and like all the while I was documenting this on Twitter people are like well I'll try that I'll try that and then oh I have like a product here so you're living at a van and building an audience how do you come up with the idea to build this I was just scrolling on Twitter and I saw like Arnold Schwarzenegger video where he puts the egg in the protein shake I started tweeting about that like maybe eggshells are uh good for your teeth found eggshell powder started putting that in the tooth powder I really like that I launched it we sold like a couple hundred like the first hour from there was just trying to take each part of like product that I use that I use myself and just replace it with something well thought out that's like made with animal products what would be your like number one and number two biggest products number one is a Talon honey bomb for sure that was like the one that set it off I was just blown away but it just like kept coming kept coming the reviews are going nuts and people just keep sharing it for no money like they're just showing it cuz they love it so much and like that was huge but uh the second product I think mint bone toothpaste that's like our second best seller now but yeah we're trying to get soap out soon I think that will be like a top seller Jeremy has proof that a simple idea can turn into millions of dollars but his success has nothing to do with luck it came from having the right information and knowing what problems were worth solving well imagine there was a place that helped you find this the problems to solve the blueprints to solve them and the strategies that turn simple ideas into a million dooll online businesses at starter story we have a library of over 4,000 case studies and business idea breakdowns all backed by data from real entrepreneurs so if you're serious about building a profitable side project head to the first link in the description and we're going to give you $99 million problems worth solving so you can find an idea and get started on your journey much love and hope you guys enjoy the rest of the interview peace all right tell me about where we are right now this is uh where all the products get made this is a vanman headquarters in San Diego so you actually create all the product and package it and ship it all from here yeah so everything's handmade here the Tallow is like scooped in by hand with a spoon it has been since like day one and then I don't see any change cuz we just got to do it by hand I think we'll just keep doing it by hand for forever but yeah every everything's made here and ships out of the same building on a given average day how much product are you creating and shipping out of here we ship about 500 600 orders a day when it's going good could be there's spikes and then downturns too but yeah it's 5600 yeah so you have this tooth powder you put it together how do you get your first customer it kind of happened accidentally it was like more tweeting along the way building the product as soon as I launched it it was in 20 minutes it was like mostly sold out people were already in a community that I was a part of so it's was like selling to that community that all kind of lived in that same Paradigm like of course eggshells are good for you cuz we already in this animal based Paradigm so it's like the customers taught me this knowledge and then I gave them this product almost do you remember how many sales you did that first day you put it up on Shopify I think it it was less than 100 tooth Powers I just made a big batch I thought I was going to sell like 5 10 15 I think we sold about 100 of them something like that yeah what was your schedule like how hard were you working during those days try to get up as early as I can like sometimes I'll get up at like 7 6 just melting it all down getting it like spinning cuz we have to spin it for a long time to get the honey in before it's too cold some days it be like 12 hours and then the next day would be nothing then another 12-hour day so it was like definitely like halfhazard but my hands were just from holding the spoon and like putting it in there like it's just like yeah excruciating after a while doing the same thing controversial marketing yeah so like it's kind of just viral posts like I found like the most divisive posts on Instagram are the ones that like generate comments and Traction in in Instagram then it gets shared it gets surfaced to everybody Instagram posts and emails like I didn't think email marketing would do much but email seems to be a lot better than I thought and then I try to do like meme marketing like a picture of Mel Gibson talking to Mark Wahlberg and then I just like write what the voice would be that got a lot of traction so like saying what I want to say but with a recognizable face with a meme that makes it relatable and sharable yeah meme marketing yeah it's kind of everything nowaday and you noce a big up taking sales when something does well there yeah like you could see it on Instagram like I'll post something then like yeah the sales just go nuts it's crazy cuz it's just like 5 minutes of work but like sometimes you're browsing for 3 or 4 days to try to find a good thing to put on getting good at like meme marketing isn't just like thinking of a meme for 20 minutes a day it's like being perpetually online that picture of Mel Gibs and Mark Wahlberg was like a big UFC fight getting that the next day when it's fresh in people's mind I think that's big it's like getting current events and turning them into memes and then relating it back to a product probably the three things that I try to do I guess if I was to break it down all right let's talk about product expansion you start with this toothpaste what do you build after that and then what are all the products that you've created so now we're just like in the bathroom Focus kind of on hygiene products so we have deodorant mouthwash hair oil and then we're coming out with soap soon and just kind of like finish out like the hygiene products then go to like I want to release like food sell our own tala get our own Bee Farm sell our own honey sort of like bridge the gap to fixing like restaurants like where you could actually go out to eat and get like a good meal every product we've had has like done pretty well so we haven't like had to discontinue one or anything and it's now like I'm just trying to focus on what's what's next and how we can get there faster and have you noticed that new products have expanded your Revenue like your existing customers want to buy all your products yeah so like that's the thing like the average order goes up like when you get most people are buying like the tooth powder is like under 20 bucks M FL is under 20 bucks but then when you get five or six products that are under 20 bucks then you get the bigger orders and that's where you could start to like make more money in Ecom cuz you get higher average orders your shipping is going down the processing is going down to ship the order getting to that point was when like we actually started to have free cash flow like in the beginning it was just like you're not making much money cuz you're making these things so slowly you're buying ingredients in very small amounts and then it just kind of like grows where you're buying in bulk you have other people making it you get some little tools that help you make it faster what's the vision for Van man where do you see this going in 5 10 20 yeah 40 years so I think we have like a unique position where we striving for like lifetime value but we get like almost 40% of the customers that buy something come back that's like what we've always sted for is like customer service like if you have any problem at all we're going to try to make it go away 100% like immediately and then uh we sell a lot of Bison fat and we sell a lot of cow fat where we can turn that into going backwards to like owning our own cows owning our own bison and starting to like offshoot more products from those animals themselves like starting to sell milk or starting to sell like meat we can make more money per animal we could take way better care of the animals and the final like product of meat we could almost sell for nothing because we've made enough money to not even have to worry about what we get for the meat that's sort of like the goal is delivering premium products allowing for premium care of the animal premium cuts of meat for like Walmart prices is like kind of the goal is extremely affordable high quality meat and eggs and and dairy and everything so what does a day in life look like for you nowadays in the morning you just come in try to make sure there's no like fires that you got to put out just kind of do a roundabout of like the ingredients make sure we're not like running out of anything and then um a lot of time is just being online commenting answering DMS emails trying to come up with different posts that I think resonate as soon as I put the post up then just kind of being there in the comments for the next few hours I think that's a huge por like you you don't want to delegate that like anytime that's when you're getting the pulse of what everyone thinks of everything that you're doing basically yeah if you could sit on Jeremy's shoulder when you were starting out when you're in the van when you were broke what would be your advice I think Etsy is the best place to start you could browse on Etsy for product ideas put your own spin on it and sell it right back on Etsy if you got a couple dollars like test ads I think you should just always be testing ads on different products and then you find that one winning ad that could float your next month and then yeah just never stop cuz I think some people get a couple failures and then they finally give up or they get like a wife and then they just accept their job but like this just for me like just never never accept that life and just try anything to get out and then once you get out you have like your whole life to live I feel like all right man thank you so much that was great yeah that was fun follow this advice and you will have a multi-million dollar company selling T powder T talb bomb yeah

================================================================================

all right Casey what's your story I used to not look at my bank account because I didn't want to know how much was in there that's the position that I was in this is Casey a normal guy who had never started a business in his life but one day that all changed we had emptied our savings account we made the decision to move in with my mom and I quit the restaurant that moment changed my life forever then after a few months of work the idea was ready so we get the inventory we get the website launch hit go and guess what happened nothing nobody came nobody bought but in his darkest moments Casey experienced a miracle the next day we did 3 or 4 x tailes and I remember like dancing in my living room right like this is it this is the moment but what goes up must come down we didn't know what the heck we were doing we had no money for marketing and I said well emailing people's free and from that moment everything changed this is a story of how Casey holiday went from working a restaurant to selling over $100 million worth of silicone wedding rings from his mom's living room welcome to starter [Music] story casy grew up like most normal kids he wasn't building businesses he was playing sports and chasing his dreams one of those dreams was to move to LA and become an actor but those plans all changed when he met his eventual business partner Ted he also managed a restaurant in Beverly Hills at the time and he said why don't you come work at the restaurant so I then started working at this restaurant in Beverly Hills and Ted managed the place and I bartended and and waited tables a few months later both Casey and Ted get married in one day while they're busing tables at the restaurant they realize they're both experiencing the same problem it's like hey man you married you know awesome congratulations like are you wearing a ring and I was like yeah I'm wearing one but it's been a pain you know every time I go work out I go play golf I do whatever I take it off and I'm a super forgetful person I was excited to wear one but I was always losing it and it also didn't make sense you don't wear a Rolex to the gym you don't wear dress shoes to run a triathlon like people have very specific accessories for very specific things that they're doing and both of us said well let's just see if anything else exists like this must be out there and I remember Ted going I'm just going to go buy one and him coming back and going it doesn't exist like it's not out there I couldn't find anything so Ted and I are there and the light bulb goes off for me of like what what have we did this despite having no business experience in trying to make it as actors the boys were excited to start building their own thing some that had more potential than clocking in and out at the restaurant they decide to give this business thing a shot it was this really cool agreement between two dudes of I don't have a kid I don't have as much life overhead as you do I have time and energy and effort but you have savings and can we just handshake deal that we're both going to put what we have into this with what our life can afford at this time yeah let's do that and so my goal was to replace a $2,000 a month income at the restaurant we didn't call it finding product Market fit we didn't call it bootstrapping in our minds it was a couple of broke dudes trying to figure out ways to get people to wear and buy our product and I think there's something really interesting where when you are starting anything you have an idea for a business you don't really know what you don't know you know you don't know things but you actually don't know what it is and the best way to learn what you don't know is to talk to people that know what you don't and so when I think about starter story why I fell in love with it it is a library of inspiration practical advice stories that you can learn from and apply to your own situation so whether you're looking for a product that you want to be inspired to try and launch yourself or you just want to find about rat entrepreneurs that started where you are so you can see yourselves in them I think starter story solves all of those problems so if you want to check out starter story and learn from people just a couple steps ahead of you head to the first link in the description but let's get back to the story Casey and Ted are excited and they even come up with a name for their brand Kao I'm one of the co-founders of Kao so I'm the president of Kao currently but there's a small problem they still have no idea where to even start and Ted had this idea of well he was like I have a friend who has a manufacture in town what if we crashed the meeting at this fancy hotel in La I was like sure man let's go for it we got nothing to lose so we sure enough we did we showed up we had bought a couple of rings from I think the local Marshals as just an example of you know metal rings sat down with the manufacturer and said can you just make these out of silicone and he said yeah sure why not Ted had very little in the savings and I had even less we combined them and said let's just put everything we have toward buying this first batch of inventory I used to not look at my bank how much was in there I just wanted to trust the fact that my rent check wasn't going to bounce that's the position that I was in and Ted Ted had a kid at the time he was a bit older than I was he was risking more than I was initially to get started but we had emptied our savings account Casey is 3 months into his marriage and realizes he's dead broke he's not sure if he'll even be able to make his own rent so my wife and I we made the decision to move in with my mom to focus on being able to build the company I would still commute 5 days a week to work in the restaurant I would take the 7:00 a.m. shift and my wife worked there too she would have the 11:00 a.m. shift she would sleep in our little red Fiat in the back lot of the restaurant in the morning until her shift started bless her so our homes became our offices our dining room tables became where we developed our website and his garage became our inventory management location despite all the personal and finan cial troubles Casey and Ted were going through there still was a light at the end of the tunnel these Rings were the ticket to their freedom and after months of working and waiting the first batch of inventory finally arrived the Rings were sitting in the garage and and the boxes were stacked to the ceiling lined along Ted's Garage when I opened up one of these boxes so excited to see the first Kalo ring that had been manufactured to realize the product quality was awful each ring was unsellable so you had just emptied all of your savings accounts put all of this time energy effort into getting these Rings the first batch of Rings shows up and they're unsellable but we need to make them sellable because we don't have any money left to buy more Casey and Ted realized they just made the biggest Financial mistake of their lives they just thrown tens of thousands of dollars down the toilet and emptied their bank accounts now they had two options shut down the company or find a way to fix the prod what happened is a ring would show up it would be uneven edges it it just was nobody wanted to wear that and I remember stumbling like going through my mom's bathroom and finding this tiny little pair of scissors that I didn't even know existed in the world turns out it was a pair of eyebrow scissors and so I remember rushing out to my wife grabbing a tiny little ring and putting my fingers in these little scissors and just twisting this ring around while I just sort of trimmed the edges of it and sure enough there was a ring that was sellable they found a solution and the goal was now clear hand trim 50,000 half in silicone rings with eyebrow scissors but the days ahead were anything but exciting my wife and I watched all six seasons of loss while laying in bed trimming Rings it was completely immersed in our life and I remember I'd wake up in the middle of the night and grab a drink of water and I would step over piles of rings because we had no place to put them and they were just laid out and we would have ring shavings all over our house stuck to our cat on our tables in our cushions in our bed like you'd get out of bed in the morning and like you'd have like shave like stuck to your back cuz you were just trimming rings in bed that was our life and then up in La it was the same for Ted the mission was finished and after getting a couple thousand Rings ready to go it was time to conquer the next challenge finding customers the thinking was the only thing that's stopping us from selling a ton of these Rings is a website I remember toiling over whether or not we were going to buy a $99 theme I remember stressing out so much about whether or not we could afford this $99 theme or if we should just go with the Baseline model that Shopify gives you out the box so Ted and I had spent months we' finally built this thing we've put the effort in we put the time in and the money and I remember just just hitting publish website is live Ted and I are fired up texting each other and then about noon the next day it was like the text message tone changed from We're launched to any visitors like is anybody coming to this thing have you told anyone bro have you hey bro have you told anyone turns out people won't magically find the site you've built so with close to $0 in their pockets and over 50,000 rings sitting in their garage Casey and Ted needed to figure out a way to put Kao out there without spending a penny on ads I thought who are people of influence this is before influencers who are people of influence that I could send my product to that would maybe supercharge our growth or get more exposure for us and one of them was Andy Dalton and Andy dton was the quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals at the time and I'd gone to TCU and I was good buddies with his wife there I thought well I'm I'm going to send Jordan his wife a Facebook message hey congratulations on getting married we just started this company I thought Andy might like one would he be interesting could I send it to you as a wedding gift sure enough a couple months later she responded said hey Andy would love to give one a shot and I remember like this is it this is the moment so I sent it to him and I got a thanks and that was about it nothing else really happened fast forward to a couple months from then there's a show called hard knocks on HBO the first episode aired 10 minutes of the episode was about Andy wearing a rubber wedding ring and they interviewed him in the interview he was like oh I just think it's really cool I can wear it no matter what it is that I'm doing I can wear it out on the field and it represents the commitment that I've made to my wife which is super important to me but also represents what I do for a living which is we could not have sent him a script that was a better way of articulating exactly what our positioning was as a company the next day I think we did 3 or 4X sales we would line up the envelopes and put the labels on of the customers and this was the first time that it went all the way to the end of the house and we had more orders this was this moment for for us of this is real and watching orders laid out all over my mom's house with trash bags of rings that we were yet to cut with eybrow scissors littered everywhere so it was very much this moment in time where there was validation there wasn't uptick in sales there was engagement and people were talking but 2 Days Later everybody goes back to living their lives and it's what you do with that attention in between your next venture to try and get more attention or have another moment that ultimately matters the most so this moment with Andy felt like affirmation which was really cool but it also was terrifying because you realize oh this thing could become something and now I actually have to build it I started to wear Cayo ring several years ago Kao wedding rings Kao Kao K ring K ring Casey realizes that Kao has outgrown being a side hustle at his mom's house at this point he's got to make a decision if he's ready to go all in and quit his job at the restaurant so that was I think the inflection point of now we're going for this so now we behave differently and I was coming to to Ted going hey I think I should quit working in this restaurant and go full-time into Kao and he's like we can't afford for you to go full-time he's right and I was like but I think we need to like there's something here I think I'm going to do it I'm going to take a risk I'm going to go for it he was like okay all right fine go for it and I quit the restaurant that moment changed my life forever now it was Make It or Break It Casey and Ted went all in and there was no going back from that point on it was a ruthless game of business a big part of our early strategy at Kayla was the recognition that we were the first mover in the category and that if we didn't go fast somebody else with more money better brand recognition better operators were going to come in and crush us over the next 6 to 8 months we ended up with about 13 people in a 200t office when somebody would call our customer service line nobody in the office could talk cuz everybody could hear everyone in the background when they called and we moved to a new office we were hiring on average about two to three people a month and I remember sitting in every interview building out systems trying to figure out how they're all going to talk to each other how are we actually going to grow this thing and operate at this capacity that we need to how are we going to develop culture all of these things that come along with scaling a company Casey was figuring out how to build a real company and the results started to pay off at that point we're doing 30 million we had close to 100 employees operating at a 20% profit margin when you grow a company that size and you grow that fast you realize how big the stakes are pretty quickly you begin to learn that mistakes are costlier at that stage but the success of it I'm incredibly grateful for and it was unexpected it was never in our heads we're going to be this big company it was always focused on being better as a company not bigger and then it was who are customers and how do we know them better than anyone in business building you can't build it without incredible people and looking back on Kayla that's what I appreciate the most for the people that I did it with and even though we didn't do everything perfectly we had a lot of success as a result of the team that we built in growing it you should be able to communicate to anyone as an entrepreneur this is the problem that I'm solving start there then to determine what the product is to solve that problem and just like the Rings even if they're terrible Focus instead of making it perfect on getting it to customers and then talking to as many of those customers as you possibly can about how to make it better we are so concerned with other people's perception of us and our product and what we're doing that it paralyzes us and so if you have this idea for a business and you want to start it and you're so concerned with is it going to be successful what are people going to think of me is it going to be dumb it's really freeing to realize that people actually aren't thinking about you at all all you need to do is go find people out there that have problems cuz everybody's got problems and then help people through giving them your solution you actually are being selfish by not solving the problem that you know people have what's up guys I hope Casey's starter story inspired you what I love about Casey's story is he found a painful problem and created a solution that the market needed that's why he sold over a $100 million worth of silicone Rings if you want to understand more about problems head to the l in the description to download our worksheet of $99 million problems worth solving and if you're really serious about building something come join thousands of Founders inside starter story all right see you in the next one peace

Tell me about yourself and what you built. I'm Charlie. I'm 31 years old and I am an entrepreneur in Southern California. I currently have six plus YouTube channels. On a typical month, we'll do 200 to 250K in revenue. We just had our best month ever. This month we'll do close to 300K. That's for the YouTube channels. And then for the staffing company, we started that last year. It's a low six figure company right now, but I'm putting most of my energy into that one cuz we want to grow it and be able to maybe get acquired someday. All right. If you can break down a little bit more about all the channels and all the businesses that you've built and how you make money. So my main channel is just called Charlie Chang, my name. We have I think 1.1 million subscribers. Have another channel called Sarwise has about 50,000 subscribers. And then we have Charlie Chang show, the penthouse. My first website is one we just started. It has like 600 subscribers as of right now. Most of my money is made through affiliate marketing right now. I'd say about 50 to 55% of the revenue that comes in. We also do brand sponsorships. So that's usually like 20 25% and then AdSense is also going to be 20 25%. That's across all the different channels. Yeah. So you're a subscriber of Starter Story, right? I am. Yeah. For about I think six months Nice. what do you like about it or what do you use it for? So, I think a huge part of how I was able to do pretty well was because I spend a lot of my time brainstorming, learning, like seeing what other people do. So, that's why yeah, I think I get a ton of value from start story just because these are like crazy case studies. It just allows me to stay on trends. It allows me to see how other people do it. I sort of view it as like a mentorship. Yeah, that's awesome. If anyone is looking for ideas for their own business, you can check out starterstory.com. learned from thousands of founders who are just a few steps ahead of you. People that haven't necessarily raised money from VC or, you know, have super rich parents. These are case studies of people that turned a simple side projects or passive income sources into businesses that completely changed their lives. So, check it out in the link in the description. Tell me about what life was like growing up and how you became an entrepreneur. So, I grew up in a non- entrepreneurial household. My parents really wanted me to be a doctor. went to college not knowing what I was going to do. After I graduated, could not find a job for the life of me. So, I basically just started doing work for myself. I'd done like every side hustle in the world. Photography, [music] video, print, modeling, and like a little bit of acting. I started a clothing brand. I've had marketing agency, real estate, mortgages, everything. It was definitely hard though because when I first graduated college, I was basically making zero dollars. Seeing all my friends with their highpaying like accounting jobs, it didn't make me feel good. I sort of felt like not successful. But I think there are a lot of people out there in a similar situation where they don't want to go the traditional route. They don't want to do something that their parents want them to do. And if I could just tell them one thing, it's like with enough persistence, with enough risk-taking, you can just pretty much do anything you want. After a little bit, I sort of started getting [music] some more clients and stuff like that. I was making about like $50,000. And then in 2020, that's basically when the YouTube channel started taking off. I think I made $750 in one single day from AdSense. And that's when I was like, "Dang, this is this could be something big." What did you do after that? I just basically started learning a ton about YouTube, how to monetize, how to make more content. Did a ton of brainstorming on what types of content I could make that were doing well at that time. I just started making videos almost every single day. I was like, if I can make this opportunity work, it's going to be life-changing. The growth was pretty fast, like 500 to a,000 subscribers per day. In terms of AdSense, we were doing maybe 10 to 20K a month. Yeah. So, that was a huge change for me. Wow. And were you just doing all by yourself then? You said we, but was it just you? Yeah, that was completely me. So, I did everything myself. Yeah. How long did it take to actually get good at YouTube? I'd say one or two years. Id started making finance content in 2018 and my first videos were super bad. A big thing that got me to be pretty good at YouTube was just being able to present information in a way that makes people want to stay and that they can actually understand. People watching YouTube aren't going to be super technical. So, you have to really break it down in a way that's easy to understand. Even if you're super introverted like I am, even if you don't have like natural ability on camera, you can get [music] good at it. Yeah. What are little things that you would advise for people to improve as they keep making videos? I'd say it's always important to up your production quality or improve some aspect of your videos, whether it be camera, audio, storytelling, stuff like that. I think everyone needs to go into any business, especially YouTube, [music] thinking I just need to make enough videos until I get one that pops off. I also think it's really important to be brainstorming and thinking about different potential pivots you can make. For example, when crypto was booming, [music] I started making content about crypto. When stocks were booming, I started making content about stocks. When side hustles were booming, I started making content about side hustles. I understand what types of things people are looking for. And I make content that doesn't need to be [music] brand new for it to be relevant. How do you really get views on YouTube? How do you make great videos that get millions of views? I focus on not just making viral videos but making videos that people are searching for. One of my most popular videos is just talking about my different sources of income. So something like that where you have an age that people can relate to big number like 10 sources of income people like wo and then a dollar amount just really makes them curious to click on it. Those types of titles have done really well for me. So a huge part of my channel is evergreen SEO content. For example, how to invest in stocks. I'll make something like that. that's something that people are actively searching for. I don't focus just on the virality. I prefer to go the searchable route in terms of videos that perform extremely well too. For example, I did a video called asking Coachella VIPs what they do for a living. I thought that was the perfect blend of an experience that most people don't get to have. Good thumbnail. It was also trending cuz Coachella was happening at the time. And then in [music] the actual video itself, we had a lot of storytelling. So that's really how you get people to click on it and then actually watch the entire video. Yeah. What kind of tools and software do you use to run your business and to improve your business? So all of our content planning is on ClickUp. We use Frame.io for uploading footage and having our editors put drafts on there. We make revision comments, stuff like that. There's tools like One of 10 and Creator Hooks Pro to come up with thumbnail ideas and title ideas. We have a pretty big team now. For all team communication, we use Slack. So that's been great. In terms of managing a lot of our talent, we use Hub Staff, which is a super good time tracking tool. And then in terms of AI tools, we are using a good amount of them to help with the content production process just to make it more efficient. For example, for short form content, we use Submagic, Dcript, and we use Opus. Those really helped us be able to push out a lot of short form content from our long form content. That's something I always tell people. If you make long form content, you might as well cut that up into short form content. All right, let's break down some of the financials behind the business. How much does it cost to run this business and what does your team look like? For the media business, we currently have 26 people. There's me, there's my COO, which is the other guy that's local. Under him, we basically have two or three different project managers. Each of those project managers works with a ton of video editors, thumbnail people, a graphics person, a website person, a lot of miscellaneous roles like that. In terms of the cost to run that team, it's about 20 $25,000 a month. And that's because we're just so heavily using overseas talent. And how are you able to find a lot of these team members? Combination of Upwork, Fiverr, online jobs, but most of our current team members are actually from Paired, which is the overseas staffing company, right? You're using your own app to Oh, yeah. 100%. Yeah. [music] Yeah. It's the perfect pairing. Hiring overseas is great, but it's super hard to find really talented people. So we basically have our local recruitment teams. They go out there. They'll sort through like three to 500 people, find the best one to two people, and then present those people to you. So that's basically what our service does. And what what kind of cost would people be looking at uh if they wanted to hire someone through your company? Yeah. So we charge a onetime placement fee. We don't take money from the client and then pass it on to the talent. It's a full handoff, which saves people a lot of money. A full-time person for most positions, I'd say, is about $600 to $1,000 per month. you have these successful YouTube channels and now you're starting a little bit of a different business uh with your staffing firm. Why did you decide to start that? I want to be more of a traditional entrepreneur where I have equity in a business and while I have the channels behind me, the marketing, it makes sense to build something that I can use my channels to help grow. All right, so for anyone watching that wants to get into entrepreneurship, what should they do? Surround yourself with content and people that are doing it. It just makes it seem like it's all possible, right? And then I would try and learn some type of high value skill. There's tons of skills you can learn within a few months, I think, that you can start to monetize. They all sort of build on top of each other, and they all allow you to be better at the next thing. Personally for me, I've never built a company that took up a ton of capital to start. I think doing some type of agency or service- based business is the best way for anyone to to get started. For any of the viewers watching, if you want to get started with an agency or service model, you can check out our 100 productized services where you can learn exactly how businesses are using the productized service model, how much money they make, how they grew, how they got customers. That's in the link down below in the description. Another thing that I've learned recently is really not trying to do everything myself. I used to think that I wanted to be a solarreneur for the rest of my life. But after you hire your first person, you realize, okay, this is what an actual business is, right? because it's a business that can run without yourself. You don't need to always be there for it to work. Some people that might be watching this may be feeling a little bit of analysis paralysis on what idea they should start. Uh what's your answer to that? What I would tell them is don't overanalyze it. Pick something. If it's the wrong answer or if it's the wrong thing, then you'll just learn from that and you won't make that mistake. If it's the right thing, then you made a fast decision, right? I think speed for successful people is such a universal trait for anyone that thinks they're in a rut or they want to have a big breakthrough. I'd say one thing they can do is really change their environment or change their routine like completely. And same thing with location. If you're stuck in a city where you feel like you're not growing as much as you should be, move to a different city. All right, tell me what a day in the life is like for you. Every day is quite different, which I think is the best part about entrepreneurship, at least for me. I usually wake up 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. Do a little morning routine. Probably hit the gym, [music] get some work done, and then the rest of the day is just working, going out. How much do you usually work per day? I'd say a typical work week is going to be 30 to 50 hours of actual work, and then who knows how much brainstorming and just thinking about it. Yeah. So, you're always on kind of thing. I think I'm always on. Yeah. It's like a lifestyle business, right? I try and make my life part of the business and I enjoy having that mix. Yeah. What do you like to do for fun or for leisure? I like to work out. I like to watch Netflix with my girlfriend, play pickle ball, play music. And this business has also afforded you some nice cars. You have a a car buying habit. I want to say it's a car buying habit, but yeah, I have three cars now, I guess. What you got? I have a RV Sprinter van that we just got. I have a Range Rover and I have a Ferrari. Why did you buy this Sprinter van? Uh, tax write off. [laughter] If you were to give any advice to your younger self when you were just starting out for with the side hustles, what would that be? I think it'd be to carve out my own identity myself rather than try and do things that are expected or that society says is normal. So, I've been a people pleaser. I think all my life. I always felt sort of out of place because I want to do different projects and things. I can really ever talk with other people that want to do something similar. Moving here, meeting so many entrepreneurs, getting to pursue entrepreneurship myself. It's really allowed me to grow as a person and be surrounded by the energy that I've, I think, always wanted to be surrounded by. Awesome. Thank you so much, Charlie. Thank you for pleasure. Follow this advice and you will be a multi-million dollar and multi-million subscriber YouTube channel. [music] Peace.

================================================================================

all right David what's your story I was working from my parents house in the bedroom day and night I had no money and it was time to really it was time to Make It or Break It this is David Park and for years he tried everything to make money I started my first company when I was 16 I'm 27 now that's a decade of failing then one day he came across an idea that would change his life forever but at the beginning things weren't looking so bright a cold called every single Agency for 8 hours a day for weeks and weeks and weeks they hang up on you reject you literally probably 99% of the time but when everything was at its worst David experienced a miracle suddenly we get a huge wave of users when we're getting to 50 60 880,000 Mr then I got a cancer diagnosis and it felt like my dreams and nightmares were happening at the same time this is the story of how David Park built an AI app to a $25 million valuation in Just 2 years I'm Pat walls and this is starter story David grew up in a family of entrepreneurs and even though they never had a lot of money he still had a dream that he could be one too when I was in seventh grade I thought you know man it'd be so cool if like if I'm a founder and it'd be so cool if I can build stuff and so when I was 16 I actually made my first company was like a clothing brand obviously it failed spectacularly David experienced his first failure early on and like all protective parents they sacrificed everything they had to send him off to a college in hopes for a better life my parents gave me $20,000 and they said you know you go to college you're going to have a better life than us you're going to go be a lawyer doctor the sad thing is I kind of felt like I didn't really fit in anywhere I didn't really feel it fit in in my fraternity I didn't really feel it fit in with like the people in my major I was always surrounded by people but I was like a little bit lonely which is kind of sad David was facing a dilemma he was an entrepreneur at heart but he was trapped in an environment that didn't make him happy so we made a huge decision he decided to drop out and Chase his dreams of starting a startup and luckily along the way he meets someone just as weird and passionate as him his eventual business partner and co-founder Henry he loved AI I loved writing we always try to find some way to make it work the sum total of failed startups that we did together was probably n or 10 which is pretty nuts eventually we stumbled upon gpt2 we asked it to tell us a story gpt2 spit out this line that said nothing is darker than a butthole and and obviously as two people enamored with this Tech we were raving we're like this is the funniest line ever also it's profound that butthole sentence convinced us two but holes to create Jenny all right so this is a quick product uh video for Jenny the boys had found their idea and and now the business was in motion Henry would do the coding and David would do the selling their goal was simple create a product to help agencies write better content with the help of AI and their next goal was to make their first dollar that was like a terrible painful time of uh cold calls obviously nobody wants to talk with you they hang up on you reject you you have to get used to getting rejected so I was working from my parents house just in the bedroom it was pretty sad my mom she would wake up and then she'd hear me just like raving to some poor soul about why they need to invest in us or they need to buy us and then she'd go before she'd go to sleep she'd still hear me kind of speaking to some other poor fellow so I like pretty much just working uh day and night the worst part was like Korean moms will just get together and just talk about their kids like their trading cards like my kid is now a level two Amazon engineer my kid is now doing their masters at Stanford and then it would get to my mom's turn and she would just say oh my son is working on a startup the most humilating thing was I had to ask my mom for her card if I wanted to get Chipotle cuz I just had like no money I was a real loser but my parents were so kind to me like they never made me feel like a loser like they would always um they would always give me food and they never make me feel bad about um uh they never they never [Music] uh so they never make me feel bad about anything they just always like there was always just food on the table on days that I didn't believe in myself I felt like my parents believed in me my co-founder would believe in me my friends obviously believed in me so it was painful but I guess I'm glad that I went through them yeah in 2020 GPT 3 came out David is getting some traction thanks to a wave of businesses wanting to get their hands on AI they're getting users but eventually they hit a plateau they try everything but they can't get past $2,000 a month in Revenue then David learns and implements something that would change his business forever it really came down to the boring stuff of just talk to your users ask the more difficult questions of you know you shouldn't be asking why do you like my product you should be asking why do you dislike my product like what like what do you love about other people's products the focal point of I feel like many Founders they talk to users is like they make it about themselves and their product when it should really be about the users tell me about your current workflow how does Jenny fit into it what exactly do you do with Jenny or like can you share your screen and can we write an article together these insights are really important we realized that people wanted to have a friendly AI assisted writing journey and so when we pulled out everything that was when we really started to grow after months of talking to customers and refining the product they start to find a new audience for Jenny but at this point David basically has 0 left in his bank account he's exhausted all of his options but he decides to try one more thing he agrees to go on a random podcast to talk about his startup Journey it doesn't have that many listeners but luckily one Scout for Jason calanus happened to listen to the podcast the craziest Miracle ever cuz like it was not viewed by many people and so I got a $100,000 check from Jason like I said I was living off Shin Ramen and you know what whatever my parents put out on the dinner table so $100,000 was so crazy the first thing we do is my co-founder and I we book a flight to Malaysia because at the very least it'll cut down our Burn by 1/4th we basically just want to extend our Runway because we kind of didn't trust ourselves with the money it was a crazy moment getting the check but I didn't feel successful at all because now the real job of getting my hands dirty was actually getting started I kind of raved earlier about like how much I love my family but but um I was alone by myself it was very productive but it was very lonely it was tough it was it was character building I would say I had 100K check I was completely by myself it was time to Make It or Break It Now the real dirty work had begun with a bit of funding and a tiny Runway David and his co-founder spent the next several months iterating and building Jenny into a completely new product talking to customers documenting the progress and trying just about anything to increase Revenue then one night something incredible happens suddenly we get a huge wave of users every minute I refreshed the page I think we would get tens of us new users every minute that I refresh the page a guy named Zay Khan posted a Twitter thread that became one of the most viral Twitter threads in history and we were actually included in that thread from there we went from like 2,000 to 10,000 Mr in one month that's when I felt the first semblance of success Jenny AI was growing at a rapid pace and Dave felt like he was on top of the world but there was still a problem virality comes and goes it's not something David could rely on to build a great business so the very next thing I wanted to do was kind of figure that out for ourselves I brought on one of my college buddies actually to help us with Tik Tok and Instagram reals All That Jazz and then we experienced our second wave of virality we understood the power of social media we continued to kind of push on with uh viral marketing when we were getting to 50 60 880,000 Mr you know now it was kind of happening where I think at at that point we were close to like a million a year from where we started that was like so crazy to us and I felt like man we could push this so much further we could go so much farther but then I got a cancer diagnosis and it happening at the same time the the most worrying thing for me though is that it would put me out of commission and there was a chance that my voice would be damaged I remember the surgery because of the fever they had to reschedule me which made my sleep deprivation food deprivation all that even worse it prolonged my pain more but one thing that helped was my mom told me that there's something I I'll tell you before your surgery and don't worry it's going to give you all the strength you need you're not even going to be nervous everything's going to be fine and then so for some reason my mom went to the bathroom or something while I was Tak a nap and like the nurses run in and they're like because of your fever complication we have to do surgery right now I don't even speak Korean to be signing documents like can we wait for my mom and then they're like we just got to run it now and I was honestly thinking about like man I got a crazy startup right now I can just bolt out of here thyroid cancer moves kind of slow like it's it's not like the craziest risk I could take but I remember on the ceiling there was a Bible verse it said like leave everything to God I was like all right well I'll leave it up to the big man upstairs like i' I I have to get the surgery so I'll just stay I don't know what I just signed my mom's not here it's fine I'll just stay the surgery went well I was able to not speak for a little bit but I was able to get my voice back few days after the surgery I was like hey Mom like what was that thing you want to tell me for the surgery she told me oh it's just it's dumb it was just this one Bible verse that I really liked and it happened to be the same Bible verse that was on the ceiling which is pretty crazy to me where I take it as is like Miracle what an awesome little blessing that I got I had to read that somebody had to tell me that and my mom was in the bathroom so I didn't get she didn't get to read it to me but thankfully that painter put it up there for me so I got to read it after the surgery I was obviously very emotional I was very moved by the love that I receiv received from like my family and my girlfriend and I thought the limited time I have left with like my family my grandparents all that stuff but instead I'm I'm spending so much time on my startup like so much time so I actually shopped Jenny to like if people would be open to acquiring Jenny at that point David was facing a wave of problems after his surgery he realized that the business was unstable without him leading the pack after seeing no growth when he was out with cancer David also realized Jenny did not have product Market fit so he had a tough choice to make either Cash Out grab a quick few million bucks and start fresh or double down find ways to fix the business find product Market fit and take things to a whole another level it just didn't feel right to like throw my cards in early you know it wasn't like a triumphant I will not sell this will it's sort of like I don't know if this is the right decision but it just feels right in my gut that one hard decision I made I'm very proud of myself from then I focused on hiring people on the marketing growth side and we went into more scaling mode I would say up to the 1 million we're doing a lot of exploring trying out a bunch of zy ideas a bunch of paths and then from 1 to three we really started heavily deploying capital in the ones that were successful tactically what I would do is I would basically start a Tik Tok account try a bunch of different creative formats and then find one format that works and somehow turn that into a series and then start multiplying your accounts so you could have multiple creators you're basically paying creators like some baseline monthly salary and you're giving them some incentives where like if your videos get X many views or if you get y conversions then you get you know even more money per month you should basically just think about how can you scale the content I think that's like the big question you should ask I started my first company when I was 16 I'm 27 now that's a decade of failing I really only got any semblance sucess in the last 18 months so it's 9 years almost a decade of just gut punches people not taking you seriously you need that discipline I think if you really care about your dream and if you really care about making something that is used by millions of people people then you can't give it like a onewe shot you can't you can't even give it a year shot you have to really put your all into it sacrifice everything for many many years and then you have a shot you have maybe a chance at success but even if you put your all into it there's a chance that you will fail if you still make a startup and if you still try despite knowing that you could have nothing and you could lose everything then that must mean that you really care about what you're building and you really care about making better life for yourself your family your users we talked about quitting earlier had I sold then which was earlier this year it was only like 6 7 months ago you know it would have been such a terrible decision for me to sell at that point because went from selling to 3 million now we're at 3 million AR we're above 3 million the true worth of our startup now is probably like 10 to 30 million you know it's like it's like way more than what I would have sold for then within 6 months we more than doubled our business yeah persistence is quite important I would say hey Pat from starter story here thank you guys so much for watching I really hope David's story inspires and motivates some of you to get started on your own thing as you saw in the video David changed his life by turning a simple idea into a $3 million per year SAS

TITLE: The $1.8M Solopreneur Playbook
VIDEO ID: vedkm3ZmHIE
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vedkm3ZmHIE
================================================================================

this guy is the highest paid solar preneur on the internet meet Brett Williams a dude who went from working a normal job to making over $2 million a year with a side project he has zero employees zero contractors and only works 6 hours a day when I first came across his story I thought he might be lying but then I did some more digging studied his business and even flew out to Arizona to meet him in person what I learned blew my mind Brett's nearly $2 million business is no accident it has nothing to do with luck but rather some very smart decisions he made while building his business and today in less than 12 minutes I'm going to break down the five key steps that took Brett from an average business idea to a $1.8 million Pere solopreneur welcome to the Playbook so Brett starts out like any normal guy working in average 9 to5 for years he's a graphic designer working on landing pages logos brand designs simple work that pays the bills but like any aspiring entrepreneur deep down he's thirsty for something more something he can truly own then one day everything changes when he comes across a peculiar website it's a subscription service offering quote unlimited graphic design for businesses instead of charging by the project or by the hour this agency charges a recurring flat subscription fee for unlimited graphic designs and by the looks of it they're doing really well well they even have a brick-and-mortar location with a few employees and this is the moment that Brett gets his business idea he decides he'll do the same thing he'll start his own agency but instead of getting on sales calls with clients they can just purchase his Services directly on his website but most importantly instead of building a whole team he'll just do it himself as a side project to earn a little extra income 12 hours in $29 later Brett puts up a simple landing page and calls it design joy in within 24 hours he gets his first paying client that's pretty fast right well that's the first key step in Brett's genius Playbook step number one demand-based pricing the hardest thing to do in business is get your first paying customer for most people it takes months to finally get that one person to hand their money over to you and honestly most people quit before they even get their first customer but Brett skips this whole problem by making one key decision he grossly undercharges for his service see when he throws up that landing page he sets his price at $449 a month Yes you heard that right unlimited design requests for $449 bucks this price is too good to be true but guess what it gets him his first customer in less than 24 hours and that's the genius behind it of course this business is not scalable at that price point but Brett understands the power of of speed and momentum when you're starting a business instead of waiting around for months for someone to pay him $5,000 a month he just throws himself into the fire and this is where Brett succeeds where most others fail he's willing to put his ego aside so he can put in thousands of reps even though he's basically working for free and these reps are the ones that eventually turn Brett into a worldclass designer his Niche starts to notice and then his Services become more in demand and when the demand increases he r raes his prices he goes from $449 to $1,000 a month then to $3,000 a month then to $5,000 a month and now he even charges $88,000 a month per client today he only needs 16 clients paying $5,000 a month to make about a million a year and this is all because he was willing to undercharge for his service and willing to do the work and that brings us to step two of The Playbook Bal [Music] boundaries so at this point Brett's put in the Reps he's raising his prices and now he has customers coming out of his ears but this is actually a problem because Brett is a one-man band he finds himself working 16-hour days on the verge of burnout the solution hire more people right but Brett doesn't want to hire people he wants to be a solopreneur so he comes up with a creative solution he decides to break the rules by creating two boundaries number one clients must submit design requests asynchronously via a trell board and number two clients can only have one design request at a time no calls no meetings all client requests must be defined in writing and once the client has submitted an active request they're not allowed to change it or submit another one this gives Brett a few days to deliver the work and once completed then the client can submit another request because of this clients spend more time making sure they requests are fully fleshed out and complete which actually leads them to sending less requests and it saves both of them countless hours of meetings this is what I call boundaries he doesn't do this because he's an he does it because he has to Brett creates these boundaries to protect his precious time so that he can spend his time doing the thing he loves creating designs without these boundaries he wouldn't be able to make over a million dollars with zero employees and he'd probably lose his sanity in completely burn out I imagine some clients don't like these boundaries but that's fine there are many that actually do and those are the ones that he works with and that brings us to the next key move in Brett's Playbook step number three the $500 client there are two types of clients $500 clients and $5,000 clients $500 clients are cheap they'll waste your time with nagging requests ask for refunds and they don't make much money themselves $5,000 clients are rich as long as you deliver they won't bother you much you'll always get paid and they won't churn after 1 month when Brett starts his business yes he attracts $500 clients but once he pays his dues he quickly moves to $5,000 clients and you're probably wondering who are these clients that are paying him $5,000 a month the answer businesses that wouldn't blink twice if they saw a $5,000 per month invoice see the client's design Joy attracts see Brett's Service as a steal here's why when looking for graphic design Talent these companies have a few options option number one is hire a $200,000 per year graphic designer on payroll it'll take months to hire them and they might turn out to be lazy option number two is spend a bunch of money on a fancy agency that will charge a per project fee that might be in the range of $30 to $40,000 and they'll take weeks if not months to implement option number three sort through hundreds or thousands of cheap web designers on platforms like upwork or Fiverr and find a needle in a hay stack or they could hire Brett a proven graphic designer who will turn around work in 48 hours all with the simple click of a button at 5,000 bucks this is a no-brainer plus they can cancel the service whenever they want just like a Netflix subscription hiring a great designer is an annoying problem for companies and Brett provides a simple solution that companies are clearly willing to pay for but it's not just about the client sprad ATT tracks and that brings us to our next step step number four high demand low touch product High services are amazing right you get paid for your output rather than your time because of this everyone in their grandma is starting one but the truth is product High services will not work for every kind of service and this is the reason why Brett makes millions when most other people make nothing and it has to do with one word profit as you know the profit equation is Revenue minus expenses equals profit but let's double click on what these look like for design Joy on the revenue side Brett's doing great and that's because Brett provides a service that is high impact a website is often the first impression that a customer will get of a startup and a really beautiful website might be the difference between success and failure for example a high or a low conversion rate companies must make sure they get this right and that's why they're willing to pay Brett a ton of money for his service on the expenses side Brett is also crushing it Brett has almost zero actual dollar expenses because he's a solopreneur his only real expense is his time but Brett only works 6 hours a day which isn't bad considering he has over 16 clients at any given time and that's because website design and branding is relatively low touch Brett can turn around a worldclass landing page in a couple hours that's mostly thanks to his years of experience but also because website design is one of those things things that you build once and you don't really have to touch it for a while that is the reason design Joy is so profitable Brett picked a service that is both high demand and low touch honestly I don't think this will work as well for other services for example a producti bookkeeping or video editing service would definitely not be as profitable because these services are less in demand and also more costly and timec consuming to fulfill and that brings us to the final piece of the Playbook step number five build once sell forever the only problem with a product highed service is that no matter what you're still essentially trading your hours for dollars and if you want to truly get rich you need to find a way to scale those dollars without scaling your time and this is the final key move of Brett's playbook in 2019 he spends 6 hours putting together a product called scribbles it's a downloadable collection of templates that other designers can use to spice up their projects He prices it at $4 .99 and it gets downloaded over 25,000 times but why is this a genius move well Brett's been spending years building up his bank of knowledge and experience both on how to design amazing websites and how to build a great product High service along the way and Brett finds a way to monetize this he turns his knowledge into a purchasable product that other designers can use to improve their own business then a few years later he takes it to the next level he creates a course called productize yourself that helps other designers start their own productize services and he charges a lot more than five bucks for this one today these info products make up 29% of his income and he doesn't have to trade his hours for these dollars because he's already put in the work this has not only Diversified his income but it's allowed him to work less and probably sleep better at night but what I love about Brett is that he doesn't just sell courses he continues to build his business serve clients and put in the Reps on design Joy it's not luck or coincidence that Brett is one of the highest paid solopreneurs in the world whether he realizes it or not this is a genius Playbook that I think anyone doing any kind of business should study I spent hours researching Brett's business I flew out to Arizona to meet him and I just really love his business and really wanted to share it with you guys I hope you learn something from this that you can apply to your own business or helps you pick the right business idea that you want to work on thanks for watching The Playbook I'll see you in the next one

TITLE: How I Built A $1M Business From This Starbucks
VIDEO ID: T_wEmB5MapE
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_wEmB5MapE
================================================================================

all right what's your story 6 years ago I started a business today that business makes over a million dollar a year but what nobody knows is that I built it inside of a Starbucks at the time I was working a full-time job I'm still working my 9 to-5 job right here and that left me with only 2 hours a day to build the business of my dreams but there was still one problem I was suffocated by self-doubt I didn't believe I could do it then I found something that would change my life forever today I'm going to tell you that story I'm Pat walls and this is my starter [Music] story all right this is me in the summer of 2017 I'm 26 years old I've got a great job I'm making six figures in New York City and by all accounts living the life of my dreams but deep down I know that something isn't right every day I go to work and do the same same clock in a few Zoom meetings eat lunch write a few lines of code and clock out this work leaves me feeling empty every day I know this isn't what I meant to do I know there's something missing see here's the truth and it might be something you felt at some point too secretly in the back of my head I dream about the idea of quitting my job and starting my own business in my free time I'm reading business books and romanticizing about being able to wake up and work on whatever I want but I keep running into the same problem I have no idea where to start how do I find a good idea how do I know it can make money how do I take the first step I couldn't find this information anywhere online and that's when I had my light bulb moment I can turn these questions into a product I'll just research successful businesses write about my findings on a Blog and share them with others who also want to learn and I didn't think this was going to be a big thing I was just genuinely interested in this stuff so this is is the beginning of the idea but it's not all peaches and cream from there this idea it nags at me for months every single day I tell myself I'll get started on it but I never do and this is where Starbucks comes into play so let me pull up a map and show you this is New York City this is where I live this is where I work and this is the Starbucks every day I walk home from work and I walk by the Starbucks and every day I tell myself I'll stop in there order a drink sit down and get started on this idea but every single day I walk by that Starbucks take one hard look at it proceed to not go inside walk home and watch 6 hours of Netflix and then go to bed and I do this every day for months this Starbucks it represents the unknown and it's too scary for me to confront it but everything changes when I come across this book it's called deep work by Cal Newport and deep work is a state of focus that you must learn if you want to do hard things after reading this book I realize that I'm completely lacking Focus so I put together a contract with myself in this contract I write down and I visualize tomorrow I'm going to walk in that Starbucks I'm going to order a coffee I'm going to sit down I'm going to set a timer for 2 hours and I'm going to just focus that's the contract the next day day one I walk in that Starbucks I sit down I set my timer and I get started all of a sudden the timer goes off I look up and think holy that was 2 hours that flew by I was in Flow State I was actually doing deep work day two I walk into Starbucks and do it again and day three I do it again and I don't stop every single day I get off work walk into that Starbucks and do my 2 hours of deep work I even start waking up at 6:00 in the morning and getting my deepor in before my full-time job even starts I'm doing it every day and it feels effortless in the progress it starts to happen after 1 month I've come up with a name and concept for my idea I'm going to call it starter story and I land the domain starterstory.com for $12 a year I launch it with a few stories and a few hundred people visit the website after 2 months I've published dozens of stories and I'm starting to find a routine the business isn't making any money but I'm starting to build a tiny audience I then start a newsletter and get my first 100 subscribers after 4 months I start working on marketing and I get my first big break one of my stories goes viral on Reddit and thousands of people crash my site and join the newsletter now I'm starting to feel like my idea is validated after 6 months I start thinking about monetization and how I can make my first dollar I monetize the newsletter with a sponsorship and I start making some money from affiliate Revenue now I'm starting to feel more confident like I actually kind of get how this stuff works and and I'm having fun in the process so this whole thing starts out as a project that I didn't really expect would go anywhere but then it gets traction and now I'm left with a new problem I need to figure out how this thing can make money but everything on the internet is about how VC backed Tech Giants raised $100 million when I just want to figure out how I can go from $0 a month to5 or $10,000 a month how do I figure this out by reading case studies about businesses that that are just a few steps ahead of me and that's what starter story is we have over 4,000 case studies and business breakdowns on successful online businesses that were started by people like you and me in these case studies you can see exactly how much these businesses make and exactly how they got started so if you're curious on what it takes to build a business to5 or $10,000 a month or even a million doll online business check out starterstory.com or click the first link in the description we're running a special right now for the YouTube family so how does this turn into a business well I'm reading case studies about businesses similar to mine and I realize that most of them make their money through sponsorships then something amazing happens I get an email it's from the CEO of a company called clavio they're a huge company now but at the time they were smaller the email says hi Pat I love starter story and what you're doing both the stories and sharing your progress keep crushing it AB it's a nice email to get but I don't really think too much of it but as the conversation goes on we start to talk about the potential of clavio sponsoring the newsletter and then he comes to me with a number $112,000 when I see this I don't believe it at the time I was basically living paycheck to paycheck so $122,000 was more money than I'd ever seen in my life I send in my bank details and sure enough a few days later the money hits my account I get the notification while I'm at Starbucks and my heart starts beating out of my chest I get up leave the Starbucks and just take a walk around the block my head is swirling with emotions this is crazy I got $112,000 deposited into my bank account because of something that I built I felt like I had just become a millionaire all those days of waking up at 6:00 in the morning going to Starbucks and putting in those 2 hours of deep work this money was the direct result of that I felt like I was on top of the world but these emotions of excitement of bliss it quickly turned to fear I thought was this email some sort of accident did I just get lucky this $122,000 it represented a decision that I had to make in my life should I keep playing it safe and keep my full-time job or was this $112,000 validation that I should go all in on one side the devil on my shoulder was saying go all in and the angel was saying no keep playing it safe and I sat on the fence for months but then I remembered why I started this thing in the first place I wanted to build something for myself and not someone else's dream I realized that if I don't make this decision right now I might never do it I might get old look back and wonder what if and that was the moment that I walked into work and I handed in my resignation I quit my job decided to go all in on starter story and the rest is history all right fast forward 5 years and that was the last time I had a regular job the last time I ever got a paycheck after that I never looked back I never stopped building and I ended up building starter story into a million-dollar business I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that it was all easy or predictable from there I failed a ton but when I look back the most important thing that I did was just going inside that Starbucks getting to work and taking action every single day I was giving myself a chance to become lucky and it took me a few months to get there but when it did when that email came through when that $12,000 came through I decided to go all in after that and that is really what made the difference that's the story of how I built a million our business from inside of Starbucks and I would like to thank Starbucks for sponsoring this video just kidding good we're making money through a couple affiliate deals and a few we're making I'm making money through some affiliate marketing ah bro what the man get the hell out of here I'm taking a DB

TITLE: I Quit My $250K Job To Become an Author
VIDEO ID: lWwZ-fsD8gM
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWwZ-fsD8gM
================================================================================

this guy quit his $250,000 consulting job with one goal to break free from what he calls the default path aka the rat race I sort of just like quit it was the first time in my life that I just let life emerge at 32 years old Paul quit Corporate America to build a new life but he had no plan so he did the only thing he knew how to do he started writing every day then he discovered something that would change his life forever he writes a book The pathless Path is really my way of making sense of my life after leaving the default path I flew out to Austin Texas to meet Paul and learn more about the pathless path in this video we talk about how he found his passion for writing why he chose to self-publish his book and exactly how much money he's made as a self-published author last year I went from Grand in revenue th000 and so far in the first 6 months of this year I'm on track to sort beat that but more importantly we talk about why everyone should consider exploring the pathless path you can't actually Escape work you ultimately need to find work that can sustain your soul and the pathless path is basically committing to that I'm Pat walls and this is starter story Paul I've been reading all about your story and it's amazing you went from a job that you absolutely hated or wasn't for you and now you've turned that into a very successful self-published author tell me more about you yeah so if you look at my income it really flows up and down but really this year is the first year that book income has been half if not more of my income in the first year I made about $50,000 for my book I sold about 10,000 copies about $5 a book second year so far the first five months I've sold about 15,000 copies of my book and that's been about $75,000 in royalty which is pretty wild last year I went from 100 Grand in Revenue that's Topline that doesn't include costs or taxes to$ 249,000 and so far in the first 6 months of this year I'm on track to sort of beat that though I probably won't because I'm mostly choosing to just spend more time with my daughter than work or try to make money yeah but I started writing while I was still employed one morning I don't know why about a year before I quit my job I just decided to come into work and I said I'm going to write on Kora every day before I start doing my work and I did that for like 100 days and something in that clicked I think I was a writer from that moment on but I was dealing with some health issues I was dealing with Lyme disease and a bunch of other stuff and I just started a Blog called lime sucks and I just started sending it to people as I quit my job I started writing about my path and it went from publishing every 3 months to every two months to every month to every week and now I'm just writing all the time when you quit your job when was that that was 2017 okay so tell me about that time you were working a high salary job in New York City tell me about that yeah so I desperately want wanted to break into fancy and prestigious companies early in my career I wanted to feel special but that never quite fulfills and so before I quit my job I was still applying for other jobs one company offered me much less than my current salary and the other ones rejected me and I sort of just like quit it was like the first time in my life that I just let life emerge but the next few months were just really hard I started taking action and setting up my freelance firm and my company in informed me that I had not stayed 3 years and would have to pay them back the $24,000 signing bonus and relocation expenses it was like I had to buy my freedom yeah but I had about I think 50 60 Grand in savings and for me that was like permission to just wander and do nothing and even if I go to broke I'll figure something out what I love about your story is that you turn down a very big deal with penguin random house if you don't know they are one of the biggest book publishers in the world so you could go and self-publish tell me why you did that yeah they reached out and it was interesting because they do have relationships that can help scale a book to a wider audience but I think for me it's too high of a price to pay one creative control I'm not willing to pay that price I don't want to give up any creative control even if it means less book sales for me and two they give you 10% of list price for hard covers which would be about $2 for me paperbacks I make about $7 $ a book hard covers I make about $8 a book so it's highly profitable when you got the idea for the book tell me about the process of writing it from a high level and then also getting it into print and publication early on I realized the personal story felt like a powerful Edge to explore so I just did that for a few months and it felt so good to really just say here's what I believe here's what it matters and here's what it's all about and here's my way of seeing the world and then the whole process was basically right intensely for a month or two take a step back try to get the structure and just go back and forth in between those two modes then you just output a PDF upload to Amazon and you can start printing and sending out books in like 3 days quick break this is me 5 years ago desperate to start my own business but plagued with shiny object syndrome I tried building SAS tools freelancing affiliate marketing but none of these business ideas ever panned out to anything but everything changed one day when I looked inside and wondered what if instead I built a business around what I'm good at and what I'm passionate about well that decision led me to building a business that now makes over a million dollar a year and that's what starter story is All About it's a community of thousands of Founders who changed their life by building an online business around their skills and their passions our 4,000 plus case studies and business idea breakdowns will show you how regular people just like you found the right idea and turned it into millions for example Luke join starter story and do Andor case study about a newsletter business that makes over for $25 million a year just 1 month later he launched his own newsletter business that did $5,800 in Revenue in 30 days so if you're serious about finding that right idea click the first link in the description we're running a special for the YouTube family all right enjoy the video I'll see you around peace tell me about why you decided to write a book about this and what's the what's the theme behind the book The pathless Path is really my way of making sense of my life after leaving the default path the thing about leaving the default path is you realize how powerful of a story it is for everyone people still ask what's your plan how are you going to make money after I left my job it felt weird I didn't have a plan and I realized you can't actually Escape work you ultimately need to find work that can sustain your soul I call this in my book the real work of your life and the pathless path is basically committing to that without knowing when that will arrive if you can monetize it and if you can explain it to to your parents or others how do you search for the work and find the work that can be your life's work if you're searching for the work that matters you should remove money from it as long as possible like fight for that the key though is mostly just quitting things if it's not the thing lighting you up you need to get that out of your life you need to minimize it you need to automate it you need to delegate it you need to quit what I recommend to most people is to try to find a 1 to three month Block in adulthood to take a sabatical disconnect from worker mode reconnect with forgotten Hobbies because the only thing that will let deeper things you can commit to emerge is creating space in your life I think too many people are uninspired doing work that doesn't matter them and they've made a deal to keep doing it because well for the paycheck for the health care benefits I'm willing to light it all on fire go broke decrease my earnings pay a status tax to keep doing work that matters to me once you find that work you're willing to pay so much to have it Central in your life all right let's talk about self-publishing if I wanted to self-publish my own book what do I need to do if you really want to basically do what I did which is I want to create something that feels good feels like a book matches what somebody might expect from a traditional publisher you want to invest in a good editor somebody that can help you bring the pieces together stick the landing and how everything flows together and that's typically called a developmental editor that's probably going to be one of your biggest Spence designing a book cover I use 99 designs I picked a designer I really liked his other designs formatting you can either use Amazon's tools to format the ebook or you can use another tool called rezy that's what I used I used the default options and then at the end you might want to hire somebody to proofread here's the craziest thing though it asks who's your publisher turns out you can just write your name that's what I did and tell me a little bit more about the process of marketing a self-published book my Approach is like what do I actually like doing and I'll lean into that I like talking on podcasts I like talking about the ideas in the book gifting book has been my other fun Channel as well and it's super easy with self-publishing too I can in the US send them anywhere for 450 including shipping what did the royalties look like what are some of the numbers when I was looking at my royalty numbers I was looking at 8.24 for hard cover through Amazon $745 for paperback through Amazon $ 3.98 per audiobook $428 per Kindle and then if I look at my breakdown of sales it's about 50% ebook 29% print and 21% audio can you break down the cost to create this book so editing and coaching is about $3,900 book cover cost me $742 publishing was $250 a fee to Ingram spark I now think that's free the Audi book was $1,280 to produce and as of today my royalties it's basically profit is anywhere from between 125,000 to 130,00 ,000 so far all right Paul so as a writer and a self-published author what are some other ways to monetize other than just book sales for me it was always make enough money to have the space and time to continue to write early on it was freelancing then it was taking some of the experiences from freelancing and turning that into a course I have a whole another sort of side thing I run called strategy U but on top of that I slowly and deliberately built a workshop business which was like I'll do EX exactly this training for this price teaching these things I've always had this weird balance of like strategy you and doing some coaching and freelancing as needed but I keep that minimal and writing and creating and doing my podcast until recently the writing and podcast and all those things were not making any money it started to even out do I have goals of becoming a full-time Creator I don't know I kind of like the weird mix all right Paul let's talk about writing how to become a great writer how to become a confident writer like you basically just is Brute Force you need to get in the Reps such that you can deal with the fear the fear of what will people say and then you'll quickly realize especially when you're starting is nobody says anything cuz you don't have any readers and then I think over the long term you really just need to develop an individual relationship with writing some people wake up and write 4 hours every day that's never been my style for me it's I need to create space in my life and a big thing I do is like I spend a lot of days wandering because it's that wandering mental time where I'm not really doing anything I let ideas percolate I'm usually reading a lot to I'm listening to podcasts that's when the creativity happens and the writing is only when I'm channeling that later you've chosen this pathless path tell me about what the typical day in the life is for you nowadays typical day in the life for me is waking up and spending time with my daughter she's a newborn now so she requires a lot of attention and I'm really just leaning into that the whole point of my path has been to essentially take time off whenever I want it does that mean I'm not working most days no I've typically worked a few hours most days for the past several years but I've always had the ability to just stop and clear my calendar that's what I've done for the past few months there's no morning routine I typically never schedule any sort of meeting before 11:00 a.m. I really just let whatever flows flow if you could go back in time when you're just starting out on your pathless path and sit on Paul's shoulder and tell him thing what would it be I don't know if I'd mess with the timeline but I might say something like just trust trust yourself I might say something about writing too I might just say like writing is important something silly like that cuz you don't want to give away the the fun of the journey the journey has been so fun for me because it's been so uncertain and that is Adventure for me I don't know what's going to come next even now I have no idea what comes next I'm excited to see what emerges that's the whole point of this journey in this book and this path all right you heard it here folks follow the pathless path and you will be one of the most successful authors in the world like Paul

TITLE: I Became A Venture Capitalist With Only $1,000
VIDEO ID: p3xa6mpxvOY
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3xa6mpxvOY
================================================================================

this guy turned $1,000 into a $60 million investment fund through a loophole that nobody's talking about The Syndicate he invited us out to New York to show us exactly how it works and how anyone can be a venture capitalist without being a member of the ultra Rich Alex has invested in over 270 private startups and the crazy part is he still hasn't quit his full-time job it's probably a 70 30% split of 70 job 30% kind of the side hustle VC World a Syndicate is like a special club for investing and now it's popping up everywhere why because it allows regular people like Alex to invest in unicorn startups with as little as $1,000 but how does someone raise over $60 million from a bunch of random investors by using a strategy called deal scouting most PES that I meet aren't going to give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about me right my check is small I'm insignificant to that but if you're able to share high quality deals or you actually Source a deal that they end up doing you'll see the relationship change quite a bit in this video Alex breaks down everything how he'd start over from scratch how he found his first deal and how to evaluate startups that could return over 20x when I say big winner I mean 50 100 250X are in your investment I'm Pat walls and this is starter story all right man thanks for having me appreciate it tell me about who you are and what you're doing my name is Alex ptis and I run what's called a Syndicate a Syndicate is an alternative approach to venture capital where you would invest in the fund and then the manager would Deploy on your behalf what we do is we provide direct access to a specific deal and allow our limited partners to participate in as little as $1,000 so I was able to invest in $27 75 companies deploy about 60 million in in total Capital all as a side hustle while I was kind of operating as an early stage employee at a startup and as I understand it you can technically invest in a startup that you wouldn't be able to invest in previously because you're putting just a little bit of money in and then you are working with a network of people to put the rest of the money in yeah so I'm not high net worth I don't have a ton of money to deploy right for me this is an Avenue to meet a typical minimum threshold to get directly on that cap table so if we are to invest 100K in a company and you invest $11,000 into my SPV you're going to own 1% of this entity that goes on the cap table and then at some point in the future when the company might IPO or exit you will then make a return if we have a positive outcome something changed in the last few years where now this opportunity is possible can you tell me a little bit more about that yeah you've now seen a number of companies that help individuals set up these spvs so you've got players like like angelist like sidecar like ca enabling individuals like me who have zero AUM nobody's invested in my fund to go out there and identify a great founder or great company to invest in I can set up this SPV I can reach out to friends friends of friends those who are accredited investors to participate in that deal and invest through my vehicle backing syndicates is kind of a unique way for these everyday investors to access this Venture Capital asset class where you need to actually have a relationship with the founder the CEO the company and at the right time of when they're actually raising around so most of these folks while interested in Venture Capital they don't know the founders they don't know the timing to be talking to the founders we take care of all of that by securing these allocations knowing the timing knowing the right companies and provide them an Avenue to participate in these deals unlike the public markets where you can simply research buy and trade as you see fit so it's a really nice way to bundle these checks democratize access to a lot of these startups and I think yeah over the past 5 years we've seen significant growth there and and aot lot of these platforms have played a kind of meaningful role in that as well tell me about your backstory uh how do you get here out of college I got a sales job at J&amp;J selling medical devices that job took me to Sacramento California decided I need to make the move to New York so uh did that and that was my kind of intro point to the world of operating and early stage startups so I ended up joining the company called Market access transformation joined as the first employee pre-launch kind of the stage of it's myself and the founder and kind of a concept that we were looking to bring to life the company went on to have a really great outcome and exit but before we got there and I was on the journey I kind of felt that my net worth was heavily tied up in one single company so in the process of trying to diversify some of my future net worth I identified kind of syndicates and special purpose vehicles I started out by backing Jason cis's Syndicate and that was like a great opportunity for me to see some of the deals he was doing and get the opportunity to participate over you know a one-year period I invested in a handful of startups I started to ramp up deal flow I started to meet other Founders that was kind of the the point and inspiration to launch my own Syndicate at this time I really invested a lot of time networking with other Venture capitalists right and I branded myself as kind of this deal flow hustle guy who would essentially get the opportunity to learn from them right what deals do they want to see what deals do they want to participate in how do they think about investing so after like grinding this out for a couple years I ended up co- syndicating deals meaning I would team up with another Syndicate lead to kind of put both our deal flow together and our LP or our investor base together to get more deals done and that was when things really started to take off so this was probably end of 2020 so the past 3 and a half years is really where we've been able to lean in now back 275 different companies deploy about 60 million in in total capital and uh pick up a lot of key learnings back a lot of awesome Founders and companies along the way so what's crazy about all this you've invested in over 270 companies while part-time how the hell did you do this it's navigating what are the times that I can spend talking to the right Founders scheduling the right intro calls with them for me I'm a morning person I get up very early and that's kind of my opportunity to get in a couple hours of work before kind of the day job hits so a lot of times it's the early morning meetings it's the late evening meetings I meet Founders for coffee all the time on the weekend it's probably a 70 30% split of 7 full-time job 30% kind of the side hustle VC world I also believe in kind of the long-term Vision here I think there's a bigger opportunity this is a growing category I want to be known as you know The Syndicate lead there a lot of that thinking and attitude I think has enabled me to go the extra mile whether it's taking an hour out of the the evening or the weekend or whatever to meet the founders build a relationship make sure that if they are indeed the right company in the right time for us to invest I'm going to be there to get that allocation quick break this is me 5 years ago desperate to start my own business but plagued with shiny object syndrome I tried building SAS tools freelancing affiliate marketing but none of these business ideas ever panned out to anything but everything changed one day when I looked inside and wondered what if instead I built a business around what I'm good at and what I'm passionate about well that decision led me to building a business that now makes over a million dollar a year and that's what starter story is All About it's a community of thousands of Founders who changed their life by building an online business around their skills and their passions our 4,000 plus case studies and business idea breakdowns will show you how regular people just like you found the right idea and turned it into millions for example Luke joined starter story and Dove Andor case study about a newsletter business that makes over $25 million a year just one month later he launched his own newsletter business that did $5,800 in Revenue in 30 days so if you're serious about finding that right idea click the first link in the description we're running a special for the YouTube family all right enjoy the video I'll see you around peace let's talk about your first deal uh you invested as I understand only $1,000 into your first deal can you tell me about how that manifested and how it worked I ended up finding this particular deal through another very early stage Venture Capital fund that I had build a relationship with in this particular company they were raising $2 million at a $6 million valuation we had the opportunity to invest 150,000 as the final trunch and that company today has recently raised at a $500 million valuation wow so that's like a 2,000 3,000% return it's a bigger return than you're going to see in the public markets it looks extremely well for all those folks who got involved at that $6 million valuation you've done a ton of deals what exactly is the selling point and how are you able to round up so much Capital so easily as a part-time job I think for each deal there's a bunch of selling points but there's really two that stick out one is who is this tier one institutional fund that's leading the round has done the diligence most of these investors will leave the round and set the terms and folks would not typically have access so part of my role is gaining that access getting the allocation to participate in that round alongside these tier one these institutional Venture Capital funds for as little as $1,000 um per deal and the second piece is the founders right for early stage investors we don't really know if this product is right or if they're going to Pivot later on we're betting on people to navigate the probably soon to be choppy Waters and figure out a great solution to the to the problem that they're trying to solve identifying Founders who have a really good background or Market fit or have shown success in a previous company as a founder or CEO those are the people that we're really looking to identify so yeah if I had to sum it up I'd say we really focus on backing the right people and investing alongside the right investors 270 companies invested in how do you find all these deals really there's five different ways that we typically Source deals and and access Founders the first is co- syndicating with other Syndicate leads like myself right A lot of times there will be other syndicates that maybe have a larger allocation than they can fill and they'll reach out to us um to kind of co- Syndicate the deal team up and put the deal together a second way is relationships with other Venture Capital funds early on in my day I spent a lot of time building this steel flow hustle guy brand for myself and I shared a bunch of deals with a lot of different VCS today I've been able to access some deals alongside them when they might be leading the round or they might be setting the terms another way that we access deals is through our portfolio Founders so as we've built relationships with the founders that we've invested in and been helpful or been easy to work with and become friendly or whatever it may be they're now referring a lot of their founder friends to us which has been a great way to access Founders early on and really in a positive light from an existing uh portfolio founder another way that we access deals is through other Angel Investors invest very early stage and you know they're not going to be competitive with us or bigger Venture Capital fund they always take a small sliver of the round itself and so when I can build good relationships with these angels and Source deals their way they also will share a lot of the deals that they are participating in or have participated in and then the last piece is leveraging our investor base the folks that invest in our deals a lot of those times they are founders CEOs heads of product engineering a head of sales or run a small business that might sell into these startups so those are kind of the five different ways that have built a flywheel I'd say over the past four or five years and see a lot of the uh most competitive deals and when you get a deal how do you evaluate how do you know it's something that you should or should not invest in so the founder CEO and their relevance to the business is always going to be the most important are they in this for the long run do they understand this Market based on their previous role and problems they may have solved companies they may have worked at are they a multi-time Founder have they shown success in a previous co-founder CEO role then we're also looking at things like how big is this market right and is it a growing Market is there an opportunity for this to be a really big company or even have multiple big companies in that market are there early signs of product Market fit a lot of times we invest when there's very limited traction and you know the business is just getting off the ground we want to see those early signs that they are building a product that customers want and will pay for and have the opportunity to scale and then some of the other things we'll look at is who is co-investing in the route I am not built like an Institutional fund with management fees to work 9 to5 on this and do the diligence that a traditional institutional fund would do so piggybacking or leaning on these funds that are set up to lead round set terms and sign off or underwrite the deal is also quite important when we think about what's the right fit for us or not for someone watching who wants to start their own Syndicate how do you get started and how do you start sourcing deals I I think it's really about leaning into building a network of individuals or funds that have access to Deals and figuring out how they can share them with you and I think in order to build that you really have to have a Pay It Forward mentality with some of these relationships most VCS that I meet right they like my check is small I'm insignificant to them but if you're able quite a bit where they actually want to lean into keeping you happy keeping you top of mind you know I've got examples of VCS that I probably sent 10 20 deals to and it wasn't until the 20th or so that they actually ended up participating in that round and now like some of these folks who I spent you know couple years sharing deals with I'm just now getting the Unique Look of deals that they are leading and now sharing with me so once you find the deal what are all the steps that happen until this deal is finalized and all the investors have put their money in the the first part is securing our allocation so typically we'll be talking to the founder they may have already had a lead VC lead the round and set terms in that case we're ready to secure our allocation and start sharing with our investors what I would do from there is put together both my deal memo on why we're excited about the opportunity and want to invest and set up the SPV in parallel this is typically about a two-day process of putting the materials together getting the SPV set up once that's complete I will then send the deal materials to our investor base typically give them about 1 to 2 weeks to make their decisions in terms of capital um to the particular deal in between that one to two weeks will allow for you know any follow-up questions investors might want to know more about the founders background or their business model you know 5 years out from now and then from there once we've got the capital committed which again may be a 1 to 2 week period we would then close out the PV and wire Capital to the company just explain to me how the business model works here how does this make money for you we make money off of what's called carried interest that we refer to as carry what this means is if you and an investor invest in an SPV that we run after an outcome an IPO uh an exit years later everything that gets returned on top of the principle that you originally invested we're going to take a 20% carry of those returns so you would get 80% of the profits so in short I only make money if I return Capital to my limited partners the investment world has some big numbers for what you're investing in what's the typical Roi for these Investments The Venture Capital asset class is highrisk high reward right this is quite different from public markets when you're investing in early stage startups you're really trying to identify one or maybe a couple big Winners and when I say big winner I mean you know 50 100 250X Roi in your investment and that company is going to make up for the other other 10 20 30 5050 losers that you may have invested in in order to be a good early stage investor you have to do a lot of deals you have to diversify it is really about finding that that big winner that U story that Airbnb story so last question we ask to all of our Founders or investors what would be your advice if you go sit on Alex's shoulder 5 years ago and what would you say first and foremost start building a network of folks who have unique access to deal right an awesome startup in a competitive round alongside these Tier 1 VCS if you're able to access that there will be investors out there that want to participate in that deal right there's multiple ways to find them being able to continue that going forward enables you to build a portfolio which is kind of a track record and a growing resume which will enable you for multiple different directions right it could be continuing The Syndicate investing in more of the best companies it could be raising your own Venture Capital fund it could be joining a venture Capital fund there's a lot of different routes that you can take and the the earlier and the faster you can do that and build a network the the quicker you'll show success and this Venture Capital ecosystem all right thank you so much Alex appreciate it this was a blast thank you follow these steps and you will invest in 270 companies in two weeks

TITLE: The Multipreneur: He’s Building A $10M Portfolio of Income Streams
VIDEO ID: nzVcbrLl9VU

================================================================================

this is Alex a guy who started a newsletter in his dorm room and then sold it for Millions but after selling that business he felt lost and spent months trying to figure out what idea he would pursue next it basically took me 12 months of doing every cliche thing that an entrepreneur does when they're looking for meaning this year he found a new opportunity a new identity to become a multipreneur the goal to launch a bunch of different tiny businesses and then CEOs to run them over the next 5 to 10 years I want to have a dozen plus companies that sit under me that I am the CEO of none of but I am the co-founder and chairman of all of them I flew out to New York to ask him about this personal holding company and how it all works turns out he's already launched a few ideas and one of them is already a million-dollar business so we have uh 12 clients that are paying $7,000 a month it's roughly a million a year in annualized Revenue we're going to dive more into that business business and go over his framework for how he finds new business ideas worth pursuing the best way to think of business ideas is to plus we'll cover the insanely Scrappy method he used to launch that million-- dooll business how he defines product Market fit and how to hire top tier CEOs to run these businesses I'm Pat walls and this is starter [Music] story what's up man what's up yeah thanks for having me okay tell me who you are and what are you building uh I'm Al liberman I started a company in college called morning Brew uh which makes Business Media fun and engaging for modern professionals morning Brew is a 200 person company that does more than $75 million a year in revenue and today I'm building story ARB a uh modern Executives personal Media company and my goal ultimately is to have a portfolio of bootstrap businesses under me so what does that mean a portfolio of bootstrap businesses there's this idea of personal holding companies that's been talked a lot about recently some people call them personal Venture Studios or my buddy Greg Eisenberg uh coined the term multipreneur a personal holding company very simply is a company that is comprised of companies under it uh and so the idea would be let's just say Alex lieberman's company is Alex liberman LLC there would be hypothetically 10 businesses that sit under Alex liberman LLC and I'm the CEO of the holding company my vision for my own personal holding company is over the next 5 to 10 years want to have a dozen plus co-founder and chairman of all of them and for me I get excited by that because it allows me to spend my time on the things within entrepreneurship that I most excited by that morning Brew taught me over the last 8 to 10 years today uh we have you know one company within my personal hold code which is story ARB and story ARB is a ghost rating Agency for B2B Executives um and very simply we help the top 1% of Founders or Executives build their brands on Twitter and Linkedin I put0 into it and our goal is to get to product Market fit as quickly as possible with the ultimate goal of having story RB a $10 million business on its own and profiting at least 3.5 million every year can you give us a timeline of how you get here I dreamed of only one thing when I was growing up and that was working on Wall Street I went to college at the University of Michigan from 2011 to 2015 studied business they are still on this path to have the world's greatest Trader job ever while I was at Michigan week before my junior year my dad passed away suddenly he was 46 years old died of a stroke was in perfect health like me and so that feeling of obligation basically guided the next 8 years of my life it forced this perspective on me that every day could be our last and we really should spend our time in a way that aligns with our values and fills us up and so I graduate from Michigan I got the world's greatest trading job I'm working on Wall Street and I realize I'm not fulfilled in the slightest while I was doing that we had already started morning brew and I was working on it on the side and I realized I was so Fired Up by what I was doing from 9:00 to midnight far more fired up than what I was doing from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 I quit my job when we had 30,000 subscribers we had not made a dollar on the business but I just had this sense of um faith and so did Austin that we'd be able to figure out a way to make money as a business so we sold the company in October of 2020 to Axel Springer almost 6 months later I stepped down as CEO of the business and that is probably the hardest professional moment that I've ever had 12 months of doing every cliche thing that an entrepreneur does when they're looking for meaning reading about stoicism taking long walks with their dog like I was trying to do everything to figure out my purpose and what I landed on was that there were a few things that I love in business I love spending time with other Founders I love coaching them I love storytelling and selling I love creating content and I love spending my time on the early days of the business you know what uh Reed Hoffman calls the town and Village stages versus like the city and state stages I love that part of the business and I just asked myself how can I spend the rest of my career just in the town and Village and not in the city and state all right let's talk about why personal holding companies are becoming a thing what do you think is the opportunity here why is it taking off yeah so I think there's just a number of different trends that we're seeing some are like macro cultural and Global Trends others our Trend specific to entrepreneurship and the business landscape the first which is like a global trend is there's just increased emphasis on the importance of like lifestyle Balance and Health in a professional's life and so I think it's very much in Vogue now to be thinking about how you're taking care of yourself we're in a golden age of Entrepreneurship right now because the cost of failure of Entrepreneurship has never been lower it is easier than ever before to ideate or test ideas with platforms like product hon or Kickstarter it is easier or cheaper than ever before to actually run your business you have an e-commerce business you Shopify you have a newsletter business you you have beehive and so I think it's inviting more people to start businesses with this different image of what a great business is and for a lot of people that's a cash flowing asset that maybe does six to seven figures a year gives you a great lifestyle and maybe you do that over and over and over rather than trying to swing for the fences with a$1 billion company that you have .1% chance of actually succeeding all right quick break this is me 5 years ago desperate to start my own business but plagued with shiny object syndrome I tried building SAS tools freelancing affiliate marketing but none of these business ideas ever panned out to anything but everything changed one day when I looked inside and wondered what if instead I built a business around what I'm good at at and what I'm passionate about well that decision led me to building a business that now makes over a million dollar a year and that's what starter story is All About it's a community of thousands of Founders who changed their life by building an online business around their skills and their passions our 4,000 plus case studies and business idea breakdowns will show you how regular people just like you found the right idea and turned it into millions for example Luke join starter story and do Andor case study about a newsletter business that makes over $25 million a year just one month later he launched his own newsletter business that did $5,800 in Revenue in 30 days so if you're serious about finding that right idea click the first link in the description we're running a special for the YouTube family all right enjoy the video I'll see you around peace with the holding company your first big success is a ghost writing agency can you tell me how you started that yeah so you know one day I was literally just on Twitter I was thinking to myself how there's all these short form video ages gencies that I've seen like a dozen pop up in the last 12 months I feel like text based platforms like Twitter or X and Linkedin haven't been given nearly enough love and so I put out a tweet that basically says if you're an executive who believes in the power of building audience but you don't have enough time or you don't have the skill to do it yourself and you're willing to spend $5 to $10,000 a year to have someone else help you build it DM me so I got 25 DMs like that's my favorite way to build a business is like product doesn't exist yet you get a sense of demand then you build the product after you truly build the plane as you're flying it so I was like okay there's demand now my next issue I need to solve for is Supply I need ghost riters CU I'm not going to write all these things so I literally connected clients with two of the ghost writers set up a slack channel for them two or 3 months in I was like okay there's enough legitimacy here where now I think I can advertise where the business is to hire a great CEO cuz again with the person personal holding company model I did not want to be the CEO of this business business and the idea is hopefully we get to product Market fit with the company by end of year where ultimately I only spend 5 to 10 hours a week on the business and that is kind of the time or investment trajectory that I hope to have with any business that I spin up can you break down story ARB how's it set up and how's it doing yep so we have uh 12 clients uh that are paying $7,000 um a month so $84,000 Top Line a month it's roughly a million a year in annualized Revenue we think this business can be a $10 million a year business that's basically 110 clients we have two full-time employees uh our CEO as well as content strategist who's a hybrid of account manager and kind of content mind and then we have three Freelancers who are ghost riders the profit margin on this type of business is roughly 30 to 35% so you know the goal ultimately is a $10 million business that does $3 to $3.5 million a year in cash flow and basically basically for our clients uh we interview them once a month we get all the thoughts out of their head and we have our ghost writer and content strategist create 12 pieces of content per week per client you mentioned product Market fit how do you determine that and how do you know when you've reached product Market fit it depends on the business that you're in for story ARB I think of product Market fit in two ways one as a percentage of of our current clients what percentage of our clients would recommend story ARB to the people in their Network where their reputation is on the line and I want that number to be at least 50% okay the other number that I'm focused on is retention because again I think the easiest part of this business is getting customers I think the hardest part of this business is keeping customers and I've heard historically for ghost riding agencies that when I talk to people who own ghost riding agencies they retain their average customer for like 3 to 5 months that is like a scary short period of time and so our goal is when we hit true product Market fit our average customer will have worked with us for on average 10 months and so those are the metrics we're focused on to hit that point where we feel like we can now scale our customer base now because clearly we're providing something that's super valuable to people a CEO runs each of the companies within your personal holding company how do you find great CEOs basically I look for a few qualities that I consider to be the unteachables I look for someone who has an obsessive brain I want someone who goes to sleep than you about the business and I want someone waking up thinking about the business cuz it means they enjoy what they're doing so much I want someone who's a great critical thinker I want them to think about how are they informed by their previous experiences but also how is this situation different and how do they need to behave differently I want someone whose value align with me like I want someone who's high integrity strong Communicator like the things that really matter no matter what business you're working in and the final piece is a great work ethic every day of the week i' bet on someone who is less talented but has more humility and self-awareness because I believe if they also have good work ethic like they will just grit their way to a higher ceiling and they will also always be willing and have the humility to call out their blind spots but I really think it's almost impossible to teach good work ethic and so I need that in CEO that I bring on how do you pay CEOs and how the distributions look like basically the range is a CEO a salary between $100 to $200,000 a year and then there equity in the business will be somewhere between 10 and 50% whenever one of my businesses hits product Market fit every quarter thereafter all of the profits of the business are distributed to equity holders and the CEO will get their percentage of equity in profit distribution and the whole idea is by having this distribution strategy it keeps the CEO super incentivized to continue to grow the business all right so you got this one successful business now you're thinking of new ideas can you tell me how you approach new ideas and how do you validate them first of all the the best way to think of business ideas is to never just sit on a couch thinking of business ideas that is the worst way to do it right be a magnet for problems so be incredible at finding and hoarding people's problems and then thinking about what are novel solutions for solving those problems if I wanted to launch another business today I would but I want to focus with story AR first so if anyone wants to steal one of these ideas they can the first idea is what I call workflow automation agency I think the next big one will be basically like notion or air table or different forms of automation agencies using these no code tools like zapier and make as well as using Ai and offshore talent and I think every business you will end up finding people working on manual tasks that can be automated or outsourced so if I was to build my next business in the holdco it would be that I think there's so much opportunity to build it so your audience should feel free to steal the idea and take it and build it themselves let's talk about the risks of a personal holding company they're pretty sexy right now blowing up but what do you think could be the downfall of that personal holding companies work well for people who understand what a personal holding company offers you and it aligns with what you want to spend your time on that's why I'm doing it but the first big risk is dilution it's lack of focus like I want to get one business right before thinking about my next business so for story ARB right now we don't have product Market fit in my mind until we have product Market fit I'm not going to launch another business once we have product Market fit I will launch a business and so my whole thesis on this is go slow to be able to go fast so launch a business figure out how to hit product Market fit hopefully that makes me better out launching a business and hitting product Market fit faster the next time and so each kind of iteration of launching and finding success with a business can happen faster and faster but like I don't also have a number in my head of like oh I need to be at 12 companies within the next 3 years I would rather four successful businesses than 12 non-successful businesses the second when you have a personal holding company and you're the entrepreneur sitting at the top of it you have to think of yourself as a product meaning you are in service of the companies you launch and the CEOs that you bring on and so if your a products like any products you have like value you have value proposition you offer to your companies and to your CEOs and if you don't offer enough value two things happen one you can't command nearly enough equity to be excited about these businesses that you've launched and two Talent like employees aren't going to be excited to work for your businesses because they don't see the value that you're bringing to the table yeah and so those are the two huge risks and I spend a ton of time thinking about them to hopefully mitigate them so for anyone watching this video uh and wants to start a personal holding company what would be a great business to start with yeah I mean at the end of the day I think it comes down to First understanding your strengths and your weaknesses you just need to be brutally honest about what are the one or two things you're exceptional at based on your interest and your past called 5 to 10 years of work experience and build around that first so one examp example I would just use is like Greg Eisenberg like Greg Eisenberg is the king of community like he is known on Twitter and on the internet as the guy who understands how to build Vibrant Community on the internet so what did he do he went and launched a paid Community for people building communities and anyone who has interest in understanding how to build a membership community on the Internet is of course going to follow Greg and join his community because they know like he is the guy for that plus not only is he just like great from a marketing perspective because people trust him for it he also knows how to build great community so he can constantly add value to his customers within that membership all right so last question we asked to all founders is if you could stand on Alex's shoulder uh in the early days and give him advice what would you say a few things come to mind first I like to say find the suck find great problems to solve don't just sit with friends on a weekend and brainstorm business ideas like immerse yourself in Industries you're interested in finding problems in identify those problems figure out what problems are especially painful there isn't a good solution for it and then start thinking about how can you provide a better solution and the second is everyone talks about taking the leap of faith in entrepreneurship and I just think it's completely a misnomer it's more about like stepping Pebble to Pebble carefully across the river versus jumping over the river like there are so many ways that you can test ideas low cost on the internet today you can put out ideas onto social you can launch ideas on product hunt you can launch a product on Kickstarter you can create a Shopify store or you can create a newsletter like my best idea for launch or for testing anything is like I always start with a tweet if there's interest in a tweet I turn into a tweet thread if there's interest in that I turn into a newsletter if there's interest in that and I turn into a video the same exact concept exists for business so don't think that business is too risky for you because you have to take a leap because business actually can be very lowrisk if you step intentionally step by step all right man thank you thanks so much for having it was awesome great to meet you yeah follow this advice and you'll have a seven figureure ghost writing agency within two [Laughter] weeks

these two roommates built a $1.8 million year business in 2 years they've worked with some of the biggest names on the internet and have done over 1 billion views on YouTube with a simple formula for going viral but they have a confession their business is not profitable we had like $40,000 of just debt for like months and months and months they choose not to be profitable for a reason because their goal is to build a business that optimizes for having fun rather than profits and like Mr Beast in invest every dollar back into creating their own content and chasing their dreams make as much cash here and then dump that all into building the next Disney they invited me into their wacky studio in Chicago broke down all the ways they make money and showed me just how fun it is to build a business with your best friend they also broke down their dead simple formula on how they can guarantee millions of views just humans are wired in this video Henry and Dylan put on a master class on how to chase your dreams while having a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of fun along the way I'm Pat walls and this is starter story welcome thanks for having me tell me about who you guys are and what you built I'm Henry this is oh my best bud Dylan and uh we built clip. Co which is an animation studio that does 2 million bucks a year in Topline and then we take basically all the profits from that and we make these crazy animated shorts of our own to tell you know really complicated ideas in a simple funny way can you guys explain to me how your business works works and what your goal is by creating this business to fund your creative Pursuits so basically we've got pool of the best animators in the world best animators and video editors and then we work with a lot of companies that have a lot of media that they want to make but they don't have anyone to execute on it so we just match up awesome animator with company that doesn't have any editors and we basically let them work together so that business clip. Co is this cash flowing machine that allows us to hire you know we have like 10 of our own animators that just work on our content and pay us so it cash flows into the content that we want to make and how much content are you guys making our goal with content is like can we just get out one short per day now I say that but they're like one of the most highly animated 60c shorts in the world we say it's like South Park for nerds so we want to explain something in 60 seconds that may be really complex but tell it in a funny and simple way and we're also taking those shorts and turning them into an illustrated email so basically double the content and what kind of numbers are this this content that doing in the last year of putting out daily shorts we've done a billion views combined and then we just launched this smart nonsense newsletter which did like 10,000 Subs in the first month and now we're 3 weeks later and we're at like 20,000 Subs take me through the timeline of when you guys first met and everything you've built since I met Henry at this accepted student day in college in 2015 we're basically good friends through all of college the only like entrepreneurial friends we kept talking and by 2020 we're like hey let's take these conversations and turn them into a podcast and hopefully the whole world will listen he's like dude like I think if we start a podcast and it'll be about this we'll call it smart nonsense and dude based on my numbers in 6 months we could have a million people listening to this thing and I'm like sign me up 3 months later we're running out of like unemployment money from the government and the podcast has 14 views um and so that's when we were like okay we need to figure out how to make money service business was the best way to do that we didn't really have anything it was just us we had some ideas we turned that into an agency which prints a lot of money and then we have all these animators and all this money and we're like 2022 is the year of making content so for the last year we've been making YouTube shorts and that's what's taken us from zero to a million Subs on YouTube and a billion views where did the idea for clip the agency come from it was basically like we made a podcast and hired editors abroad in the Philippines to help us produce it we like did this whole system so I'm like let's try this little podcast system with our favorite podcast which the first one was my first million they're looking to crack into video Sam par and Sean Puri have no idea how to do a video podcast so they're hitting up Twitter like yo who's going to help us with video should we do video vote in this poll or whatever and we're like dude we'll do it for free and we're there tomorrow yeah and basically like forged plane tickets we're like dude we're we're literally there tomorrow I hope you're at your house and then Sam and like are you you guys serious like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what is this so we had this strategy like we're crazy we're going to show you exactly what we're going to do for you and then just beat you over the head with it until you pay us money we tried this with the all-in podcast we want to work with them so like let's make one video for them that'll like wake them up second video is like oh this is really interesting like what's Henry doing what's Dylan doing and the third video they're like how do we work with you and it was cool like in allin's case I remember the first Blitz video went out and Jason kakanis was like I don't know what you want but like you're hired so that it woke him up pissed him off one so you guys were basically just doing free work how did you guys fund this the first agency we worked with basically gave us a little bit of buffer we have maybe a month of free work we can do but they better pay us like the day that month ends Unfortunately they didn't pay us the day ended so Henry's credit card basically came into our lives and we had like $40,000 of just months and we were always of the mindset we were like okay if we can't pay this credit card what's the worst it's a 20% premium we got to like we just have to make 20% more money that was kind of our mindset just have to sell one more client we can do that luckily we tend to grow the business to like pay it off but it is this risky like scary in the moment oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we do have a lot of debt like a lot writing on this you guys have worked with some huge names Will Smith Ali abdal nval how did you land huge clients like that we called it squatter marketing we're just going to pretend like they hired us and be the crazy person that like makes videos for them for a year straight just not getting paid but because they share all our stuff everyone thinks we work with them they're like oh if Allen wants to work with them why wouldn't we cuz that's the PIN so now we get all the clients from their Network quick break this is me 5 years ago desperate to start my own business but plagued with shiny object syndrome I tried building SAS tools freelancing affiliate marketing but none of these business ideas ever panned out to anything but everything changed one day when I looked inside and wondered what if instead I built a business around what I'm good at and what I'm passionate about well that decision led me to building a business that now makes over a million dollar a year and that's what starter stories all about it's a community of thousands of Founders who changed their life by building an online business around their skills and their passions our 4,000 plus case studies and business idea breakdowns will show you how regular people just like you found the right idea and turned it into millions for example Luke join starter story and Dove or a case study about a newsletter business that makes over $25 million a year just one month later he launched his own newsletter business that did $5,800 in Revenue in 30 days so so if you're serious about finding that right idea click the first link in the description we're running a special for the YouTube family all right enjoy the video I'll see you around peace you guys have done over a billion views on YouTube You've created viral content to a science so what's the secret of creating viral content how do you do it when we were trying to engineer viral content Dylan comes to me and he's like what have people been watching forever for the last tens of thousands of years and what will they keep watching and we came to the conclusion it was like story people were telling stories in cave paintings so they will be around another 50,000 years right we were doing all this content before that was like abstract and I was talking about book quotes and like who knows what and Dylan was like Henry just tell a really good story humans are wired to listen to stories so if your story is good on a 60-second clip you can get people to watch for 55 seconds the human brain literally can't not finish watching a story like we want to close those Loops so that was the big breakthrough with story and then our advantage was we had this team of amazing animators so we could can now animate these stories and bring them to life with basically our version of South Park so now you're hooked on the story itself and then you're just following the journey on screen you guys have a team of 50 animators and editors tell me about how to hire great people and keep them on our principle has always been hire better so our current team we're not going to accept them unless they wow you meaning like wow this person is better than me I would learn from them and then you look back and you have 50 people who are all just learning from each other and it's so Talent dense when we're looking at people's portfolios we should just trust our gut if they're really good our gut is always like whoo like did our did our jaw Hit the Floor were we like wow if we see someone work and our guts like on the fence never going to work out and where do you find this kind of talent we started hiring when we were getting money from the government to survive and we're like okay Henry will sleep on the floor so he doesn't need as much money and I just wear the same t-shirts every day so we'll take the extra money and hire editors but we we couldn't afford like A5 $6,000 editor in the us but we knew we also couldn't afford to be editing content daily if we wanted to make content daily we need to Outsource the editing immediately yeah or otherwise we'll burn out we can't edit and make all the content if we want to focus on the content we need an editor immediately so we hired in the Philippines the Philippines is the best place in the world for Creative Talent what is the cost of something like that look like a lot the cost is a lot so our personal teams like maybe 25 or 30 grand a month which is funny because that's a lot of money to be paying for shorts that make 5 grand a month so operating at a total loss but for us it's like that never felt like much money because it was just cash flowing from the agency we never saw it it was never in our pockets like might as well be I don't know lit on fire maybe this is the benefit of doing the Mr B strategy of just throwing profits back into everything so it doesn't feel like we're spending anything for anyone watching this video I want to know what it's like to start a business with your best friend I don't know how you could start a business without your best friend at this point the highs are so incredibly High and the lows are so Grim I guess one thing we do is just like use humor to get out of it every time it's like lucky we going to make 50 Grand by tomorrow how do we do that and he's like dude I don't know but we do it every time for any solo founder uh kudos to you but we could never do it this is like the best thing in the world I'll also add like so Dylan's a perfectionist through and through sweats the details every single one of um and my skill set is very much like let me just ship things that are 80% good enough so me without a Dylan over time just like starts sprinting in the wrong direction Dylan without me doesn't get enough stuff shipped out the door to have iterations so I think are that kind of co-founder of maybe the executor and maybe the perfectionist or the Visionary um or the Builder and the seller I do think like that's probably the maybe the best archetype but maybe it's all I know so you guys have this business that makes $2 million but your whole focus is on creating content why content over money well we saw the The Pinnacles of success luckily like doing all this blitzing we got into the room into literal parties with some of the richest most powerful people and the funny thing was a lot of them were jealous of us and what we could do so they would ask us about like Hey how do you how do you build a personal brand like how do you grow and uh we're just like let's just make enough money we don't need a billion dollars like they do and just funnel all our money into content and just kind like shortcut what they did walk me through a day in the life for you guys you got two really sides of the business that you're working on what does a typical day look like for you with these businesses at this point because we've outsourced the entire running of the agency it's just like explore ask the question why find that thread go down the rabbit hole and then our job is just like tell it in a 60-second book report which is super fun so we just get to learn and be curious and then I spend maybe an hour a day just like floating around the agency making sure there's no major fires and then we usually talk in the afternoon and he's got some crazy ideas something he's been uh thinking about that we explore what is the long-term Vision what does the future look like for what you guys are doing we're definitely lifestyle first so we're just like always optimizing for fun what's the path of least resistance how can we have the fewest headaches like how can we just be happiest in the short run so it was always like how can we put the right people in place to make sure we're working on the content on the stuff one thing we like is this idea of being above the clouds it came from Colin and smeir but it's like you need to stay above the clouds have everyone doing what whatever they need to be doing below the clouds but the second you the the leaders or the Explorers The Visionaries the second you come below the clouds and you're like doing day-to-day stuff and like answering this and doing that fire you're in a lot of trouble beyond that we don't we don't plan too far out I have this tendency of planning and planning and planning and getting the logo design and doing the artwork and like not actually doing anything so Dylan having us just like default to action our plan is in the short run optimize for happiness and then like as a byproduct just teach as many people as possible seems to be working where can people watching this YouTube video get ideas on how to make money now we started with our own itch we needed a podcast to get edited so we hired editors and then oh turns out other people have podcasts that they need edited so they just used our editors turns out they could pay us for that so we have always just subscribed to do what you want create the product you want and there are probably other people like you so sell them that product yeah if we create something we truly need right now there's probably 10 other people that need it and we can charge them a couple thousand bucks that's enough money to live so scratching your own itch last question we asked the founders if you could go on your guys' shoulders and give each other advice what would you do differently or what advice would you have for Founders the tendency because it was my tendency is to just over complicate almost everything in business I'm like thinking about oh what's our subscription price and ah turn's too high and like we need account managers and we need project managers and we need quality assurance and dyan's like no if we can match an animator with a client for 2 years everything else goes to zero nothing else matter matters I think a big misconception is how you approach business business shouldn't be this you make money 10 years in the future which is kind of where Henry was going originally versus I'm like how do I make money 10 hours in the future how do I do something now make money today I think people just get scared about business and end up not doing anything when you could just go and Pitch your idea and try and make 10 bucks off it that's the advice I would give to anyone thinking about becoming an entrepreneur thanks for having me guys thanks for coming through follow this advice and you'll get 1 billion views and one here nice

TITLE: He Built A $2.5M/Year Business In 2 Years
VIDEO ID: i6kCkGmJc9M
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6kCkGmJc9M
================================================================================

Carl Hughes built a $2.5 million year business in just two years with one strategy putting ourselves in people's minds as the premium provider he invited us into his home in Chicago to show us exactly how he did it and how he found a niche where he could charge tens of thousands of dollars per month to just a handful of clients but before he started the business Carl was plagued by self-doubt I just didn't have the confidence to think I could do it I didn't believe I was the kind of person who could start their own company now he's running multiple million dollar businesses with a 10year goal to hit a $100 million in total revenue and his plan to reach that goal has nothing to do with starting new businesses I got to meet a couple people who had done this thing called entrepreneurship through acquisition in this video Carl shares what most people get wrong when they go to start a productize service and he gives a step-by-step breakdown of how he would start all over again with nothing I initially started draft dodev not even as a company there was no website there was no landing page I'm Pat walls and this is starter story yeah thanks for having me dude good to see you Pat tell me about who you are and what you built my name is Carl Hughes I run draft. deev primarily and then actually just recently bought a second business I'll start with draft. Dev what we do there is we create technical content aimed at software Engineers for marketing purposes so this is for companies that want to reach software developers we've grown in 3 years to over $2.5 million in Revenue we've got a full-time team of six or seven and then hundreds of contractors literally hundreds around the world in 54 countries so that's where I'm at today wow and so how does that work how does the service work draft. essentially what clients will do is they'll come to us and buy a package of 12 24 48 pieces of content that they're going to publish on their site typically blog posts tutorials things like that and then what we'll do is go through the process of finding or using our writer pool who are all software Engineers that are practicing day-to-day to write this content for them pair them up with good editors they'll clean up their work we have Tech reviewers and staff so full-time Engineers that also check their work and then we get stuff back to clients on a weekly or twice a week basis yeah and what's the type of client or company that pays or something like this yeah so when we started out is a lot of early stage startups that were just kind of trying to get their first marketing efforts underway now what we tend to do is work with bigger more established companies so some of our headline clients might be places like red panda Cloud flare Dropbox we've worked with a lot of big Brands who are trying to reach Developers for one reason or another and so any company that wants to sell things to developers usually it's like software tools like idees or um testing tools or could be security tools all that kind of stuff you want to sell to a really technical audience and so you have to build Authority with them you have to build trust and one of the best ways to do that is through content whether it's written or video or you know some mix of both tell me about your backstory how did you get into this business back in college I studied mechanical engineering and minor in business I initially thought I'd go work for a really big company I did internships with GE and seens like huge companies multinational um and it was the most boring I've ever done in my life so like I was like I got to get out of here my dad was an entrepreneur I had an uncle who was an entrepreneur they were smalltime local business owners but like you know they had that freedom they had the lifestyle that I was looking for more I started to look into that I started look into internet entrepreneurship I learned how to code on my you know my free time I started picking up some freelance gigs making WordPress sites just for on the side so I came out of school I moved to Chicago I worked with this small company called uloop I was there for a couple years and then I got a job as the first engineer at a company called packback I left about four years into that to go join an early stage startup called the grade Network and then about 3 years into that Co hit and that was just the game changer that's kind of forced me into entrepreneurship so I was looking for something to do like I got to fill my time a but I also want to make some money and contribute to the family I initially started draft. deev not even was no landing page there was nothing it was a single page on my personal website called Carl's writing and I would send that around to people and say Here's a bunch of things I've written recently would you pay me to write for you I sent that around to all these people in my network I I reached out to people randomly I started to have phone calls with people who worked in these fields uh called developer relations which I never even knew about before that and I started to figure out that oh maybe there is more demand for this and there is there is something here so you know that kind of started in 2020 with me freelancing writing a few articles here and there within 3 months I had way more work than I could handle and I started to hire people and I you know sort of phased out of my old job so your Niche developer relations content is super unique how did you find this Niche and what's your advice to others that are watching that are looking for the right Niche yeah when it comes to finding a niche it wasn't super intentional on my part I didn't have this like formula where I was going out there and figuring out exactly what I'm looking for but it was more like is this something I like doing in interested in and as I talk to customers are they willing to actually pay for it it's really easy to miss that because a lot of people just pursue the things they're interested in that have no potential monation or they pursue only what customers want to pay for but they don't care about it at all they have no interest or knowledge in that space and that's super hard to stand out into let's talk about getting your first customer how did you get your first customer your first few customers and what would be your advice for others looking to get their first customer I don't even remember who the very first customer was but at least the first 5 to 10 were all people I had met at some point in my profession professional Journey before and who I had stayed in touch with I have this strategy I came up with just after college where I have a spreadsheet of about 50 people who I just want to keep in touch with who's on that list has changed over time is my interest have changed what I'm doing but I've always had like a weekly reminder just go reach out to a couple of those people and either have lunch or at least send them an email to see how they're doing do a quick call and that network list has been one of the most powerful things in my career it literally got me my last two startup jobs it got me started with draft dodev and so that small amount of effort as much as it doesn't pay off quickly was super helpful in the long run as starting a business talk about the fundamentals of a product High service how is your team set up in terms of employees contractors and partners again it's kind of grown over time it started off where we have a writer uh and an editor and then I would kind of sit in and do all the tech reviews is what we call them where I just see like is this technically a very strong article does it make sense is an engineer that's actually like pretty experienced going to buy it and eventually I hired out a full-time engineer to do those tech reviews and then a few Engineers that were kind kind of helping in out on that the team today at draft. Dev is a little smaller than we were at our Peak last year just because Tech has kind of been in a downturn uh VC funding is about a third of what it was last year so naturally we follow some of that curve um but we've still got six full-time team members and then uh hundreds of contractors that help us out with things like editing tech reviews writing uh and then a lot of administrative stuff too let's talk about marketing as a business scale you got it to 100K per year and then you took it way bigger to 2.5 million a year what are your main way that you marketed and scaled a business to the point it is today so it divides roughly evenly into thirds we've got about a third of our business comes in from referrals and word of mouth so that's existing clients telling their friends their colleagues that are in similar businesses or it could be an existing client has a marketing person that leaves and goes to a new company and they kind of bring us along for the ride and then the other third is going to be organic search and social media I kind of lump those together because they sort of feed on each other but that could be things like we write a blog post that ranks for a certain term like developer advocate what do a developer Advocate or something and then we also write a lot of social media posts that help kind of push people towards that same thing and then that last third is cold Outreach and just unknown random things that come up we've always positioned ourselves as the premium service in this Niche therefore we don't do a lot of discounting we don't do a lot of one-off Trials we make people sign quarterly commitments and that's all by Design like the best agencies when you look at the way they do it they don't do little one-off work for people and part of it's just a nature of our cost like our costs are pretty high per article because were paying Engineers for their time um but at the same time it's also just about putting ourselves in people's minds as the premium provider that kind of carries through to all of our marketing and so when people come to us most of the time they've heard of us through several different channels but you know we can kind of attribute it to one primary Channel you built this business to 2.5 million a year in basically 2 years how did you learn all the skills needed to do that one is I was the first employee at two early stage startups so I got to go with the founders on the journey from like hiring me their first employee to growing and raising money and doing all the things that Founders do in those early days and so that was super eye opening gave me a ton of insight into what it takes to actually start a business it also gave me a lot of confidence I think this is something that most people when and myself included when I was thinking about starting a business and trying little businesses for years before I got draft. Dev to actually work I just didn't have the confidence to think I could do it I who could start their own company and seeing Founders do that firsthand who were no different than me they weren't smarter they weren't more educ ated they were able to do it it made me realize like oh this is very possible it's not as unachievable as you might think and that's where like surrounding yourself with other entrepreneurs people who are maybe one step ahead of you is super powerful I spent 7 years trying to build 24 different businesses the only one of them was successful now that business makes over a million dollar a year but I could have done it a lot faster if I studied already successful businesses imagine you could read the exact steps to how someone built a million-dollar business and the mistakes they made so you can avoid them when you launch well it starts story we have a library of over 4,000 case studies and business idea breakdowns where you can do this All Back by real data for example Luke joined starter story in Doven to our case study about a newsletter that makes $25 million a year just one month later he launched his own newsletter and did $5,800 in Revenue in 30 days it's simple he studied what works implemented it and avoided the mistakes of people that were just a few steps ahead of him so if you're serious about finding a business idea that works and making your first dollar 10 times faster check out the first link in the description we're running a special right now for anyone coming from the channel anyways enjoy the rest of the video peace I also got a lot of experiential practice by starting little side projects that never really took off so I had a ton of these like at least 10 of them that I I actually have some documentation around of like what I tried to do in the business uh how it didn't work what I did learn from it all these little experiences add up and they stack up on top of each other so I think it's important as an entrepreneur even if you're struggling and going through a million different little iterations of projects and you're not hitting your stride like that's okay that's part of the journey and you have to accept that and just keep trying anyway if I hadn't kept trying then we wouldn't be here right so draft. Dev massive success in 2 years what do you think made it so successful I was able to do it part-time and kind of get myself like make sure it was viable before I went full on into it I think that would have been really tough to put the pressure on myself to like go 100% fulltime Market timing was a big factor Co had just happened all the tech companies that were doing marketing had to redirect their conference inperson budgets into something cuz they were all getting funding still they still had a lot of money to play with as we started draft. Dev all of a sudden there's just you know hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars being dumped into Marketing in a in content in the developer space and we were so Niche and so specific that we built trust much faster than a company that was just a general purpose content agency would have done so with draft. Dev you prove that the model works and now you bought another product High service can you tell me more about that yeah for sure Pat last year when draft. Dev was growing I was able take a whole month off when my second son was born and I I kind of had this like existential crisis like what am I doing and what do I what am I building this for like what's the point because I had kind of achieved the goal that I set out to at the beginning which was take a month off and the company runs without me I got to meet a couple people who had done this this thing called entrepreneurship through acquisition which is basically going out and buying a small business and taking it over and running it and so I got together with a friend of mine I kind of sold him on this Vision we had been talking about doing a project together for a couple years he's like yeah I'll come along let's do it so we got the money together to put uh to kind of go in and start looking for a company we went through and talked to at least 50 to 100 Founders about their business how big it was what might make sense for them to if they wanted to exit uh and then we found three or four that looked really good we finally settled on one that that we really liked and the founder was ready to go what it showed me was a it's possible to buy another business uh B now that we've run it for a few months it's possible to run someone else's business uh and it lets you skip years of work and I I mean I don't want to say that's free because we obviously we paid for for it right and there's a lot of debt that's on the table but at the same time like we've now jumpstarted our second company our goal was to you know learn how this process works we're buying a company prove that we can do it and we can run it we can make it better hopefully over time and then hopefully do it again in a couple years let's talk about the opportunity of productized services they're kind of blowing up right now why do you think this is and why are you so bullish on them productize services are super appealing they were for me because they'll allow you to start a business that is theoretically scalable but at the same same time takes very little cost to get started with so I think they're a great place to start for a lot of entrepreneurs they're kind of a little bit of The Best of Both Worlds of like a traditional agency or Consulting model mixed with SAS and that you know reoccurring Revenue if someone's starting a productize service today what do you think are some of the best niches or Industries or verticals to go after I would kind of look at the way I started draft. deev what's something you're interested in and have the skills to maybe do on your own at the beginning especially if you're a first-time entrepreneur because I'll admit that you shouldn't be doing all the work forever but hiring other people is a a whole skill that you have to learn over time and you should kind of grow into it baby steps so if you're starting your first product di service find something that you could do most of the work with yourself if you had to and then that there is actual market demand and this again goes back to my number one advice for new entrepreneurs is talk to more potential customers and learn what are they paying for today that they're unsatisfied with and if you can get that answer out of your target audience an audience you want to work with that's how you build a producti service I think the wrong approach is go I want to do a producti design agency cuz I've seen other ones be successful but I don't know anybody who would buy from me and I don't know anybody who needs it and I don't know why those other ones are successful I just know they are on the other hand if you're able to go talk to 10 or 12 customers that have tried these other agencies have been unsatisfied why are they unsatisfied what did what could you do better if you redesign the service from the ground up and that's going to give you a way to differentiate and that's the name of the game when it comes to like carving your own little niche in any product service all right man thank you for having me this been amazing congrats on all your success man thank you follow this advice and you'll build a $2.5 million Dev writing agency just follow the steps

================================================================================

what's your story [Music] I mean we bootstrapped this thing from day one and we need it to be profitable we didn't have any money to put in we couldn't afford to lose this is Aaron Spivak and he nearly lost everything launching a business at first he thought he was a Founder genius we were doing 30k a month 60k a month 90k a month but then realized it was just beginner's luck you know our first summer we went to zero it was a moment of like are you guys actually going to do this or not so what happens when you're staring in the face of failure and your bank account is losing money every day my co-founder leor called me and he's like hey we gotta we gotta shut this business down do you give up we need to prove that there was something here or do you jump even further into the abyss and go to the ends of the Earth just to find a way to make it work we broke the internet we went viral on Netflix for doing that for the first time ever in that moment I was like that's why we storytelling this is the story of how two guys from Toronto turned four thousand dollars into 48 million dollars in four years I'm Pat walls and this is starter story growing up Aaron was your typical young entrepreneur hustling and starting just about everything lemonade stands party buses and even starting his own Juice Shop in Toronto but everything changed when he met leor his eventual business partner he realized there was a bigger opportunity starting an online business I always wanted to really start a business with lior I thought he was just super smart he was like in that online world I was opening up two shops and making smoothie recipes and I actually wanted to sell Cricket protein that grinded up crickets and I brought it to leor and he's like that's disgusting but have you seen this rise in weighted blankets and then we went on Google and we saw that there was 300 000 people searching for weighted blankets in the coming months with enough proof of concept and validation Aaron and lior started developing a sample of what they thought to be the perfect weighted blanket and the wild thing is that they were doing all of this while they were working their current full-time jobs like I was opening my juice shop at 6am until like 2 3 clock and then I'd probably work out or eat dinner lior was running a software company the same time frame we'd meet up every day at like seven o'clock at his apartment and then we'd work till like one two a.m after grinding it out for months the plan started to fall in place Aaron and lior found a new audience to Market these weighted blankets to and started running ads on Google so we literally with basic images in one sample put up a pre-order site and then we bought ads for the most expensive keyword which was weighted blankets first sale came in we made I think like 20 bucks the next day we made three sales I remember Leo and I took those three sales extrapolated over the year I'm like oh my God we're gonna buy Ferraris like we're rich like this is it we were doing 30k a month 60k a month 90k a month with a little bit of beginner's luck they were really successful out of the gate we launched in January we went from one three five sales 20 sales a day but they were not ready for what was about to happen and our first July in Toronto it's 30 degrees outside which is the hottest month month of the year we went from all those sales to literally zero sales most days and some days one our best day of the month we maybe had two sales Aaron and lior had made a huge mistake they didn't forecast their inventory for the summer months and this was threatening their entire business they were running out of cash and sitting on hundreds of unsellable inventory lior even came to Aaron to shut the business down you know our first summer we went to zero my co-founder Leo called me he's like hey we gotta we gotta shut this business down because I'm not interested in a seasonal business we have a seasonal product we're stuck with all this inventory let's get rid of it as fast as possible and you know you've got juice shops he had a software business let's move on in those moments it was like looking yourself in the mirror from being like am I actually the real deal do I wait do I actually know what the hell I'm doing like do people actually like my like was this all an accident the fast success started to collapse for Aaron in lior and the dark thoughts came pouring in as their bank accounts came closer to zero so because we were broke it was one of the most challenging years of our lives and there was doubt and there was uncertainty I mean we bootstrapped this thing from day one and we need it to be profitable we didn't want to we didn't have any money to put in we couldn't afford to lose it was a moment of like are you guys actually going to do this or not if even though things were tough the boys were determined to figure it out but with money running out they had to do something quickly and this is when Aaron had a brilliant idea we needed to prove that there was something here that someone wanted to buy this product and once they got the product that they were happy with it we weren't just good marketers with shitty product it got to the point where I was like hey why don't we just call everyone because clearly they were buying it they're not buying it now why are they not buying well just ask and that's exactly what they do in August of 2018 they sent out an email to all of their customers with a calendly link their goal to talk to every single one of their customers and ask them why they stopped buying the blankets every single person said the exact same thing Aaron we love the blanket it's so amazing it's it's incredible but I'm sweating in places I've never sweat before it's disgusting so I'm putting it in my closet and in the winter I'll pull it back out and this is when Aaron and Leora have the biggest breakthrough in their Journey instead of launching a product and hoping for the best they realized the secret to building a business is talking to customers and it was like a light bulb moment where we're like wait a second why don't we just make a cooling weighted blanket because if it was cooling you would use it all year round like of course we would of course we would so we spent all of September flying around talking to suppliers and sourcing the coolest fabric ever we ended up having to create our own fabric which is called the ice fabric which is the coolest Fabric in the world it literally keeps you cold without any water or fans going through your bed but it was so expensive it was a hundred thousand dollars to get the first roll of that fabric and we couldn't afford it Aaron and leor are faced with their biggest challenge yet they need a boatload of cash to make more blankets but they're down to their last four thousand dollars because they wanted to stay bootstrapped and keep 100 of the business investors were off the table so they decide to throw a Hail Mary and try raising a few thousand bucks on Kickstarter they set a very low goal of 25 000 in hopes it will be enough to keep the business alive and make their next order when the kickstarter goes live something amazing happens the boys raised over one million dollars in the first 30 days so in 2019 we launched the 1.0 the hush ice the world's coolest weighted blanket it was a top 10 Canadian Kickstarter of all time and when people ask us like what was the hack how did you reverse engineer Kickstarter like what it was what was it a specific agency or a video style and it's like no I mean I had 3 000 people that literally told me on the phone that they would buy it if I made it Aaron and Leora realized they need to take the momentum from their Kickstarter and push it into something even bigger they sit down and ask themselves this question how can we get these weighted blankets in front of a massive audience they come up with a plan they're gonna weasel their way into one of the biggest shows on television that year we then went on Canadian hit TV show Dragon's Den and we went on the show told our story and had in 14 Seasons so 14 years of the show there's never been a pitch that came on and increased their evaluation on live TV through debate amongst the dragons and we were the first we broke the internet we went viral on Netflix for doing that for the first time ever it catapulted the brand as 2020 comes around the boys continue to double down on their success reinvesting every dollar they earn they pick up the phone again and continue talking to customers and this gives them a new idea to create a new product a pillow they call thousands of customers and get feedback on what would make the perfect pillow then they launch it on their email list and sell 3 000 pillows in 72 hours and I remember I post about it on LinkedIn I'm like hey we just sold out 3000 pills in 72 hours and everyone's initial reaction is like what was the marketing what was the email what was the hype what was the flow and it's like well no actually retired last year we were talking to our customers literally asking them what pillow you want let me build it for you they realize they have a formula talk to customers understand their problems and then create more products to sell them so they do the same thing and launch the hush ice blanket 0.0 and then do the same thing again and launch the hush ice bed sheets that year they do 20 million in sales we over doubled the business again heading into 21 where we just said it's time to shine we want big goals we wanted to do 40 million bucks we really wanted to sell the business at that time with big plans to sell the business Aaron and leor need to find a final product to create that will increase their valuation so they decide to do something that nobody expects in an industry where it's nearly impossible to make a profit we have the stupidest idea in the world which was to launch a mattress in a box no one makes money selling mattresses in a box but for whatever reason we thought we could and we spent three months calling customers because we were so nervous so expensive the inventory was so expensive so for the next few months they of course spend all of their time calling up their customers and asking them what would make the perfect mattress and to their surprise the biggest pain point was that their current mattresses were super uncomfortable when it came to making love so we went out we created a specific Zone technology that has specific Springs and specific areas that keep you flat no matter how you're positioned or how you're leaning up against something we did a million and a half dollars on launch which nobody believed that we can do then in October of 2021 the biggest sleep company in Canada gives them a call they want to acquire hush blankets we sold the business to the largest sleep company in the country we went from zero to 48 million and 48 months and it's been a really fun ride along their Journey Aaron and Leora learned hundreds of lessons but there's one lesson that stands out and it's something they didn't realize until they sat down and really looked back all of these phone calls and customer conversations created a community of super fans customers that would buy from them forever and it's actually what makes hush stand out from the thousands of other companies selling the same products we opened our first pop-up store the highest grossing Mall in the country fourth in all of North America and aloe also decided to come to Canada open the same time as us and they had 700 people come through their door on opening day we had 1500 and who came our people there's a blanket behind you someone's had a sign their blanket and they gave it back to us as a souvenir one of the executives from the company that purchased us was there watched it happen in real time and came up to me after he's like I've never in my 25 years in this industry would think that someone would ask a guy that sells blankets to sign the blanket in that moment I was like that's why we storytelled today customers care more about the people behind a brand than they do about the product itself Aaron and Leora documented their journey and got customers involved from the start they weren't just selling blankets and pillows they were bringing their customers along for the ride being vulnerable and sharing all the ups and the downs I think storytelling is the most important thing you can have when you're marketing a brand and storytelling is the emotions and it's the magic that people want to feel before they go out and purchase something like if you think about Abercrombie walking into a mall there's two shirtless teenagers with six packs labs and cologne that's like oozing out and we're all like yeah that's us you know and like now that story doesn't resonate but that's who we wanted to be we wanted to be that guys with the cool hair and the six-pack ads that the girl loves and that we smell good and we we walked into the store we bought those jeans and we put them on and we felt like those guys that Essence that emotion that magic is everything when building a brand people can have that feeling with small Brands and small businesses and I don't know why I don't know why Founders are are not leaning into that perhaps they think it's beneath them but that's how you build community from four thousand dollars in the bank to 48 million dollars Aaron and Leora have proved that thanks to the internet anyone can build something huge as long as you're willing to pick up the phone and tell your story anything is possible what the internet afforded us was guys like me are able to go and compete with the big guys because the internet previously you needed to go and knock doors of these retailers and beg for them to take your product they'd put you in a shitty Corner no one would try to have no sales you have returned and like it was the barrier to entry was so big but now there's a story for the underdog there's a story for the guys shooting on their cell phone that gets to be that way I do that to me

this kid made over one million dollars in one year with a business idea that nobody's talking about AI generated books he invited us into his apartment in Toronto to show us where he found this idea how he started on a budget and how he built it in a few hours a day while attending College full-time before the money Joe popplus was just a uni student stocking shelves for 11 bucks an hour now he's making a living selling thousands of ebooks using an unconventional method with chat gbt initially this wasn't the way I did it but this is the best way to do it now but the craziest part about his business is actually not how he creates the books it's how he advertises them the majority of my money has been made off of dads the AI Revolution is here and Joe is living proof I'm Pat walls and this is starter story you built an amazing business tell me about who you are and what you build I'm Joe I'm a 20 year old computer science student I've built a book brand that is now valued at 930 000 I generate all books with AI and then I Market them on Pinterest to middle-aged moms how did you come up with this business idea 2020 was the year when I graduated high school I started working on a use case for gpt3 I got a really good idea of how AI could be integrated into different business models in 2022 I was like why don't I just utilize my pre-existing skill sets AI gpt3 is now out a few businesses know about it maybe I could help provide some value to like some small mid-sized businesses who want to learn more about AI around that time that I got that idea people actually started reaching out to me asking about my experience at openai I had a kind of like tab on my LinkedIn that showed that I had worked on use cases for openai for the gpt3 beta they started asking me certain things it got to the point point where I started charging for the advice that I was giving in July of 2022 I met with the Publishing Company where I got the idea they showed me their stats and how much money they were making off of selling books that was a complete eye-opener for me I didn't realize how many people bought books per month their revenue was about two million dollars which was absolutely insane to me I thought why can't I just start up something similar because what they were doing was so insanely simple that they were not doing anything AI book related and when I met with them I told them nothing about my idea that I had kind of formulated while we were on the call in the month of August I generated 10 20 books I generated a few more in September by the end of September I was at 40 bucks I generated 40 books with AI then on October 3rd I hit my first profitable day and I was like 20 October 4th I was like at forty dollars and then from there it almost grew X-Men actually on December 28th I'll never forget this day that's when I hit my first 1K day profit and that was crazy that was just after Christmas and my whole family knew about it I told all my friends we built this business from money that you made for your minimum wage job did you do it all yourself yeah it was completely self-funded and if I did it properly the first time with the stuff that I know now I could have started it up in under 500 but I just made a bunch of mistakes yeah it's just a new Venture for me how did you manage building this business while you're in school and you had a part-time job that was probably the hardest part for me I was fitting in time for me to work on the book brand when I was studying for a huge test it was coming up in school I dropped two courses to work on my book Brands but I spent most of the day working on school and then I would spend five six hours in the nights working on my book print how can someone who's watching right now get into AI generative books the best way to start off learning is taking an interest in these gender of AI models and learning how they work how you can get the best output out of them with the correct settings with the correct prompts then you need to find a niche a niche that has traffic a niche that has a lot of ambitious people in it when you have people like that you can tug on their emotions more and you can present the outcome to them that they want to achieve and the only way to get to that outcome is through your product your first AI ebook that you created tell me about how you did it I literally knew nothing about books so I was researching how to actually build a book I knew I could write it with AI like I knew the output would be good enough but I had no knowledge on how I should structure it what should be included all of that when I created my first book it was probably the worst book anybody could ever read like there was no congruency nothing as I actually started purchasing my competitors books and reading through them I knew exactly what I needed to include it's not as easy as just putting into Chachi BT write me a book on whatever initially this wasn't the way I did it but this is the best way to do it now you get Chachi PT to create the book outline let's say for example you have five chapters and then per each chapter there are five topics you are going to go through each Topic in each chapter and generate that topic even though I wasn't super experienced with writing books people still like them the first few ebooks that I put out they they enjoyed what they were reading hey real quick that business you want to start let me show you how you can make your first dollar ten times faster by using case studies imagine you could read the exact steps to how someone built a million dollar business and the mistakes they made so you can avoid them when you launch well at starter store we have a library of over 4 000 case studies and business idea breakdowns where you can do this all backed by real data for example Loop joint starter story and dove into our case study about a newsletter that makes 25 million dollars a year just one month later he launched his own newsletter that did five thousand eight hundred dollars in Revenue in the first 30 days simple he studied what works implemented it and avoided the mistakes of people that were just a few steps ahead of him if you're serious about building something check out starterstory.com or running a special deal this week and you can click the link below in the description to get it much love and I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the video peace can you break down how much profit you made and what the business is valued at today two dates I've made 390k dollars profit and my current valuation is nine hundred and thirty thousand dollars what's the typical profit margin in a business like this my profit margin is about 70 to 80 percent the only real expense that takes away from my profit is the ads I have my premium extension subscriptions which is about 200 a month creating books to create a full book it's about three dollars with GPT three and then I have my proofreader just go through everything I have them on a retainer but you can just do the pre-freed ink yourself at the starting when you started out you proofreaded everything I did yeah I spent a lot of time I would basically basically generate a full book do a rough draft and then I would meticulously go through each chapter each subtopic just going through the book and I just do one revision of that and then I'd have a good ready to go book tell me more about the marketing side of things as I understand uh you make money with ads how specifically does that work majority of my money has been made off of Pinterest ads when you land on Pinterest and you start with Pinterest ads you're going to start off with consideration campaigns and then you're gonna move into conversion campaigns consideration campaigns are going to give you a general idea of which Niche you should be selling your product in you're going to test out different niches with consideration campaigns then you're going to go way more granular you're going to set up your Pinterest tag and then move into conversion campaigns where you're really going to dial in every single stat take a look at everything your landing page copy whether people are converting above the full below the fold all of that tell me a little bit about how the landing pages work how do people find the landing pages and and what's the purpose of them the landing page is going to give you room to show the lead value Stacks what's provided chapter previews everything it gives you so much more real estate to sell them on the product it's almost impossible to sell if you don't do a landing page a landing page is also the first touch point where the lead is going to get a really good idea of your overall brand image so if your landing page is really really bad it doesn't look professional they're gonna bounce they're gonna bounce right away and you're going to get a bounce rate of over 80 percent over 70 percent that's when you know that you know your landing page just doesn't look professional with AI books there's a low barrier to entry right anybody can write an AI book and sell it how do you approach competition and things getting saturated I'm at a point right now where my brand has so much momentum when I see new competitors coming to the space it doesn't scare me it hasn't affected my profit and I don't expect it I don't see it affecting my profit in the future either because I have such a loyal customer base there is such a huge Market as as well I'm only advertising on Pinterest when you take Google ads Facebook into account there's so much room for growth I'm sure there's going to be many many like hundreds of book Brands popping up but the market is so huge by the point that I predict or expect it to get saturated all be well on my way I think that'll be years down the line though and saturation just means more competition it means you need to be better at what you do provide more value in your product and I think it's good for people to stride towards providing more value how sellable is a business like this initially I didn't think it would be super sellable and I wanted to test the waters and what I did is actually posted a bunch of the details just on a few marketplaces I just wanted to see what investors would offer for my business the very first offer I got for the entire business was nine hundred and thirty thousand dollars when I saw that number and I got the email notification that I got an offer I was like I'm really on to something here now I'm actually working with an investor who is purchasing 40 of my book Brands and I'm able to continue building up another book rant to then maybe sell another 40 so it's a completely repeatable process where you can build a book brand sell it build another sell it and it doesn't mean you have to sell this whole Corporation you can sell just parts of the corporation like what I'm doing right now you made all this money selling AI books uh what does a typical day look like for you what's your typical routine all of my mornings are usually spent on making sure the ads are running correctly making sure my proofreader is doing what he needs to do I'm just checking in with the business now I'm working a lot and this is mostly the afternoon I'm working on teaching people how to build their own book brand that's been extremely rewarding I've had some really successful students they've been absolutely killing it and then in the night I actually make house music as a hobby and I actually have a few songs posted to my Spotify so AI music is that the next thing yeah it could be it could be yeah that's amazing what's your DJ name it's just my name Joe popolis nice yeah you made a lot of money as a 20 year old uh have you bought anything cool with the profits I really haven't bought a lot of things the only thing I bought is just this Rolex and I know it's going to keep its value I want to stay away from depreciating assets as much as I can for now I just want to make a huge bag and then in the future in the near future I'll invest and you know get a nice car all that kind of stuff but for now I'm just solely focused on building businesses I'm very lean and I want to stay that way for a while if you could sit on Joe Pablo's shoulder when you were just starting out you you had a couple failed business ventures what would you tell him I would tell him to prioritize learning over earning be more focused on learning the skills building up a huge skill set instead of being focused on how much I'm earning it was almost impossible for me to fail with the book brand because I had built up so many skills beforehand thank you Joe yeah follow us advice and you will make millions with AI books so yeah did you make house music I do like house music do you want to hear the latest songs

this is Danny Miranda the man who went from his parents basement to sitting down face to face with the most influential people in the world how did he do it with this laptop in this microphone he started a podcast but before I tell you about Danny I have to remind you about this incredible Joe Rogan Joe Rogan you would have heard of this guy he's got the most listened to podcast in the world Spotify bought the Joe Rogan podcast Joe Rogan just got a 100 million dollar deal from Spotify how in the world is a podcast worth 100 million dollars to find out I flew out to Austin Texas to sit down with Danny who might just be the next Joe Rogan he broke down exactly how he started a podcast with zero dollars how it makes money and how he's landed some of the biggest guests on the internet that's how I got Gary vaynerchuk for episode 39 of the podcast he also shared with me the reason why everyone should start a podcast and how the business of podcasting is a lot bigger than you think Danny is proof that anyone with a laptop and an internet connection can start a podcast that changes their life I'm Pat walls and this is starter story Danny you went from hanging out in your parents basement to starting one of the most influential podcasts in the world you've had guests like Gary vaynerchuk and Andy frisella tell me about what you're doing and why you're doing it I created the Danny Miranda podcast in September of 2020 because I enjoyed talking to people on the phone and I would have such great phone conversations that I said I want to record this why don't I share this information even if no one listens and so I started this podcast by putting out three episodes a week in September 2020 and I grew it to the point where 30 to 50 000 downloads a month and I've talked to some of the most interesting people in the world who were my heroes and who still are and it's been an incredible journey tell me a little bit more about that journey I started by thinking about who were the people that were fascinating me who are the people that I I was inspired by that I was curious with and how could I talk to them for an hour that was Kamal ravacott that was gay Hendrix and these books were so influential on how I thought that I wanted to talk to them I wanted to learn more about them their story and connect with them and so I didn't really have any reason to do that but once I had a podcast I suddenly could and that was a game changer for me that I had an excuse to talk to any person I wanted to for an hour or more I know podcasting may seem like something people just do for fun or as a hobby but actually it might be one of the biggest opportunities of Our Generation tell me more about that podcasting as a medium is so new it's only been around for 20 years and that might sound like a long time but if you think about the radio the radio was invented in 1895 and so if you think about the radio being involved in the world in 1915 compared to where it was at its peak if you think about podcasting compared to that trajectory we're in the early days even though it seems like everyone and their mom has a podcast the truth is that it's just getting started and the truth is that listenership increases year over year the ways of listening increase year over year and the desire and hunger for conversation has never been higher and tell me a little bit more about the business opportunity of podcasting I know that there are businesses behind it that are built what have you seen yeah so advertising is the most common model for the biggest podcast in the world but there are other models that I think are worth exploring and are interesting one is courses or subscriptions to newsletters so you funnel people from a podcast to a newsletter or to a a course another potential Avenue is Consulting of some sort so for me I help people and connect people to some of my guests they help me with money and I help them build their podcast up from the ground up so on day one of their show they're getting phenomenal guests another one that's potentially interesting is creating some sort of conference or Summit bringing the people together that you've had us guests and maybe become friends and have them as speakers and maybe they'll do it at a lesser cost or for free because they're your friends then so I think there are many different Avenues to explore when you're connected to amazing people what are some of the biggest businesses you've seen podcasters build and what does that look like so Joe Rogan I believe had a 50 stake in on it and they sold that company for 300 million dollars but I think that it's the early days I think this is like looking at like NBA players in 1970 or 1980. podcasters are going to have a deep connection with people for a long amount of time p people who have deep connections to a lot of people can build amazing huge businesses on top of that and so Joe Rogan's Spotify deal of 100 million or Alex Cooper getting paid 20 million dollars a year from Spotify as well those are the early signs of what's to come let's talk about how to get started with a podcast what is the most basic fundamentals to get started you just need a zoom connection and an ability to want to reach out to people for me it started with sending DMS to the people that I was interested in and what people don't realize when they're starting a podcast is they underestimate the amount of people who will say yes to them there are more people who will come on your podcast than you probably imagine just send 100 messages and really be interested in a wide range of people and you might be rejecting yourself before you actually are even sending the message so yeah send more messages is my tip for people who are just starting out and then in terms of tools and equipment you might need what does that look like so I think you can start with a sure mv7 and a zoom connection and you can get it done just with that alone you can upload on anchor which is free which I use to this day it doesn't cost much what costs is the effort that it takes to build the podcast yeah I see you as one of the best podcast interviews at least in my experience how do you become a great interviewer for me it's about putting care and attention on the other person and that starts with the research process so in the research process I will try to spend five to twenty hours of podcast episodes Googling their name Twitter Instagram really stalking the hell out of them being my own private investigator so I can spend so much time with them that I can live in their shoes so I can get context for the things to ask them and the best questions give people a new insight or a new aha to oh that's why I've been acting that way or oh that's why I did a certain thing so I'm aiming to give people interesting experiences about their own life by shaping the way in which they think about themselves all right Dana you've had a ton of amazing guests on your podcast how did you get your first guest and how do you get amazing guests so the first guest I would recommend going to a friend somebody you already feel comfortable with and somebody you're excited to talk to and do that for 10 episodes try to connect and actually be interested in the guests but also have the guests be interested in you that eases some of the pressure off who was my first amazing guest that was Gary vaynerchuk episode 39 and that idea of him coming on the show was so out of left field and so unexpected but it gave me a lot of confidence to know that I could talk to him and he could have a great conversation from it so I think that how do you get amazing guests you need to hack their attention how do you hack their attention you use the platforms that they spend the most time on and you give them value in some way that could be in ways they've impacted your life that could be sending them interesting messages that could be with an interesting subject line or something unexpected but you need to figure out a way to hack people's attention if you want to get amazing guests [Music] in terms of getting good guests their Outreach side of things what do you tell people use Twitter Twitter is the most untapped resource there is for getting guests and I think it's because the most thoughtful people in the world are on Twitter and everyone checks their mentions and I've been public about I think a lot of people are scared to tweet out at this person I would love to have you on my podcast or I would love to have you on my YouTube show they're they're scared because they don't want to be rejected right or publicly rejected at that and I've always been comfortable with let me just throw this out there the odds of them saying yes to come on the show are very low but if they do that's a home run yeah that's how I got Gary vaynerchuk for episode 39 of the podcast I got it because I just tweeted he was one of my dream guests and then I put out a screenshot of a blog post that I wrote about him in 2009 and then he followed me and then I tweeted that he followed me and then people said in the comments and the replies to me tweeting that he followed me people telling him that he should come on the podcast and then he did so I've used Twitter really effectively I think to help get amazing guests on the show that I otherwise wouldn't have been able to get yeah hey guys that sniffing you just saw with me and Danny is from an exclusive interview we filmed just for starter story members we dive even deeper into the business of podcasting creating a vision Landing guests in a ton more if you want to see the full interview join starter story and you'll also get access to over 4 000 business idea breakdowns that can help you find the perfect idea take Luke for example he joined starter story and dove into our case study that breaks down a newsletter business that makes 25 million dollars a year just one month later he launched his own newsletter and did fifty eight hundred dollars in Revenue in his first 30 days he studied what works implemented it and avoided the mistakes of entrepreneurs that were just a few steps ahead of them so if you're serious about building a business check out the link at the top of the description the first 100 people that click that link will be able to try starter story for just one dollar alright enjoy the rest of the video with Danny peace all right let's talk about marketing it's easy to start a podcast a lot of people start it but usually find the hardest thing to do is to get people to listen to it how have you approached marketing uh when you started and also today so a lot of people think that if they have an amazing Big Time guest that is going to bring in new listeners that's not enough the marketing is something you have to do you have to grow the show you have to take a big concept and you have to chop it down into things that people will want to watch in short Snippets that might not know who you are tap into a bigger conversation right so let's say we have a podcast and we talk about entrepreneurship entrepreneurship is a bigger conversation than Danny Miranda or Pat walls tapping into bigger conversations is really how you grow the podcast because people might not be interested in either of us but they'll be interested in the bigger conversation of Entrepreneurship and tell me a little bit more about that marketing strategy looks like you how many Clips are you posting a day and what does that look like so on YouTube we're posting at least one video Everything single day so that's a full length video or a video that's over one minute long every single day we'll also post at least two shorts on YouTube every single day we'll also post at least three Instagram reels every single day and we'll have at least five Twitter clips from our show every day so if you think about how much content is getting distributed how many conversations are getting started because of this podcast it's insane head not to make someone feel bad who's just getting started if they're in your first day your first iteration just focus on what you can control I built up to that process but now I have an editor on the team but when you're just getting started focus on the most important part which is the conversation there's a lot of podcasts out there and a lot of them go unnoticed how do you stand out as a podcast you care you care more than other people and that means caring about the clips that you put out caring about the guests giving the guests a good experience and doing everything you can to care more than the other person if everyone has a podcast the person who cares the most about their podcasts and their guests are gonna win long term yeah but if you can also go a different route you could also Care More by having a specific Niche that you want to focus on I know there are people who have been successful by having the marketing show or by having the entrepreneurship podcast or by doing a slight tweak on something that people don't want to discuss call her daddy by Alex Cooper succeeded because she talked about a topic that was Taboo in the mainstream but that she was able to use and navigate through if all of that goes to say you can be a niche and succeed or you could be yourself and succeed regardless you have to care a lot about the person on the other end as well as the audience when you are thinking about growing the podcast foreign let's talk about consistency and you've done 359 episodes in two and a half years really haven't missed a day if you think about it tell me about your approach to consistency I put out three episodes a week because I I understood and reverse engineered Joe Rogan Joe Rogan has put out three episodes a week for 10 years I've put out three episodes a week for two and a half years so what is that going to mean it's not going to mean that at the end of 10 years I will be Joe Rogan what it means at the end of 10 years I will be better at communicating my thoughts and asking questions and really that's what I'm trying to do with the podcast so the consistency is helpful to help me be a better communicator and I look at each episode as going to the gym it's like showing up even when you don't feel like it it's not like I'm sitting there so excited every single moment of every day but I know that it's helping me lay a brick to be better tell me a little bit about your routine I know you like routines and you're into meditation tell me more about that because I think it's amazing what you did thanks man I mean I think meditation and having presence is the key for being a successful podcaster it's very difficult to do what I do asking questions listening really being with somebody if you haven't first been with yourself as deeply as you can connect with someone as deep as you affect yourself so medication is a key part of that going on walks going outside in the morning just to hear the birds chirp right it's just like something I love doing for 10 minutes and it's such a subtle thing but it just reinforces wow like life is great and like I can be present in this moment when quote unquote nothing's happening as well as Fitness I wouldn't be the podcaster I am today without spending a lot of time in the gym that's the consistency piece of it and also spending a lot of time with my own thoughts and thinking about how do I view the world and what are the topics and messages that I want to promote through this podcast yeah if you could sit on Danny's shoulder when you're just getting started podcasting or in the early days what would you tell him keep going this is what you are here to do this is your calling this is something that will help you fill the network of people you love trust respect and admire and make your Heroes your friends so even though you haven't recorded with some of the people you will meet someday the things that you are doing right now are helping build skills that will forever help you in whatever Endeavor you do in life

TITLE: I Make $11M/Year Selling One Product
VIDEO ID: 5C3YCTL-36c
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C3YCTL-36c
================================================================================

this guy made 11 million dollars in two years with just one product how by capitalizing on one of the biggest marketing opportunities in years user generated content Oliver brocato started tabs chocolate in his college apartment just two years later he was a millionaire by age 21. I pretty much drained my entire bank account to go all in on this business we met up with Oliver and he broke down exactly how he's built an 11 million dollar brand how he runs it with zero employees and why he created a product the world has never seen before so I saw sex chocolate on the internet the secret behind this business lies within a loophole in The Tick Tock algorithm and Oliver breaks down exactly how he's leveraged user-generated content to take advantage of that loophole I've created my own content machine where every day hundreds of videos are going out and reaching millions of people which in turn is responsible for the 11 million dollars plus we're going to do this year Oliver is proof that anyone can turn a one product brand into millions with one marketing strategy I'm Pat walls and this is darker story all right Albert tell us what business you built and how much money you make yeah man um so I sell sex chocolate on the internet in essence we created an edible for sex we took the most popular and effective natural supplements that typically come in a pill or powder format and we transformed it into a very luxurious high-end experience this year we're gonna do about 11 million dollars in Revenue so it's pretty incredible how far we've come no outside Investments I've just been constantly reinvesting every dollar back in to fuel the growth sex chocolate is a wild product idea it really it really stands out and starts a conversation how did you come up with the idea for this my body was scrolling Tick Tock one day he was taking and he saw this video posted by some like teenage girl uh reviewing a sex chocolate and he sent me the video and eight million views two million likes and I go to look up the product online and they don't even have a website didn't have a social media page didn't have an Instagram enough Tick Tock and I was like yup this concept is absolutely brilliant clearly they've already validated that it can go viral if I were to take my AI prior experience and background in this space I can make this into a multi-million dollar brand I then ended up spending a year you know like building this out the right way agonizing over every single little detail in order to create the best customer experience there's a million products you can pick why sex chocolate yeah we knew from the start that we were going to be able to take this from zero to 100 super fast we had the experience we had the skill set we had the knowledge and the marketing sauce it was just now about finding a product that would you know intrinsically go viral and that's exactly what tabs is you're scrolling you know through Tick Tock all day you see sex chocolate what like it's it's super novel people have never seen it before right and so it invokes some sort of reaction which is the key to going battle is you know something what they call emotional arousal making the viewer feel something and it doesn't matter what you're making them feel it just you need to make them feel like a super intense emotion and that's what invokes people to eight watch the entire thing and then B like share with their friends which creates intern Vitality let's talk manufacturing and working with suppliers how do you get something that's in your head an idea and turn it into this yeah absolutely you know there's first the Box itself we had to like design that kind of raw files I was designing them myself on canva and figma and then we sent it over to a professional designer to really clean it up then we have to get 3D renders made and then we sent it over to our manufacturer in China the boxes are made in China the chocolate and anything that touches the chocolate is made in the United States that's super super important to me uh you know in terms of the Box itself once we have the design file once we had the 3D render we sent it over to them and they made their first prototype and then there's the chocolate itself in order to create the chocolate they're like four or five different Niche supplement manufacturers you know each supplement has its own independent manufacturer because we Source the best of the best and then each chocolate is wrapped in a plastic that has its own you know manufacturer and then you know the chocolate doesn't just spawn in this format there's our logo the two T's over here and then there's a clean brick so that you know you can break it and split it right I mean I don't know get away from you oh but yeah I mean that's kind of what the whole entire um you know supply chain looks like and tell me about some of those mistakes that you made in the moving pieces what are like the top three Melodies uh Inventory management yeah yeah so I could tell you like right off the bat um when we sold out we decided to ship our next order of Boxes by but the reason being is that when you ship it by boat it's a lot a lot cheaper than shipping it airfry but it also takes four times as long so we ordered you know like I think it was like 60 or 70 000 boxes and it was a disaster the container got delayed and so you know as a result we basically just put everything on pause we moved to pre-orders but you know sales just decline decline decline almost went to zero so you know there have been many many times where we've run out of chocolate or we weren't able to forecast demand properly so what we've been trying to do is just order as much inventory as we possibly can and it's which is why we've been reinvesting every dollar back into buying as many boxes and chocolates so that we can hopefully be prepared but it's been a Perpetual problem in fact in our first year of business we we were out of stock for more months than we had stock and we still put up like four million dollars so yeah pretty proud about that hey real quick that business you want to start let me show you how you can make your first dollar 10 times faster by using case studies imagine you could read the exact steps to how someone built a million dollar business and the mistakes they made so you can avoid them when you launch well at starter store we have a library of over 4 000 case studies and business idea breakdowns where you can do this all backed by real data for example Luke joined starter story and dove into our case study about a newsletter that makes 25 million dollars a year just one month later he launched his own newsletter that did five thousand eight hundred dollars in Revenue in the first 30 days it's simple you studied what works implemented it and avoided the mistakes of people that were just a few steps ahead of them if you're serious about building something check out starstory.com or running a special deal this week and you can click the link below in the description to get it much love and I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the video peace [Music] let's talk about the power of a brand there's a lot of people on YouTube that talk about Drop Shipping and how it's easy to get started what's the difference between what you're doing and Drop Shipping everybody that you see on YouTube like perpetuates like this Drop Shipping story like oh like you want to get rich overnight like make money Drop Shipping the only people making money through this Drop Shipping thing are the people that are selling the courses like secret for you it's the YouTuber that's behind the camera that's like get into jobs you're getting into jobs like not like they're the only ones profiting on that Drop Shipping sucks you're selling a trendy product in an incredibly saturated market and you have no competitive Advantage why is the consumer going to buy it from you versus buying it from Amazon why are they going to buy it from you versus you know buying it from the other 150 sellers that are Drop Shipping the Sim exact the answer is that they're not the power of the brand is dropping a product on your website and in 30 seconds it's sold out the power of the brand is creating a community and like an identity uh you know between you and your consumer where they live and breathe and die for your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when you unlock something like that you made it because it doesn't matter what you sell it doesn't matter what you drop you got a cult like following and on a business sense what that means is that you have Evergreen customers forever so like when you have new product drops when you introduce new skus like you know that people are coming back and you're going to be able to make money off of this customer cohort time and time again on top of that you know with the brand You're Building equity the people that make money I'm talking real money they don't make it off the cash flow they don't make it off the yearly sales they're making it off the exit with Drop Shipping there is no brand equity which puts you in this really difficult spot to ever build any sort of thing that's concrete or build anything that's of real value because every two months you're you're closing down shop opening a new shop closing down shop opening a new shop so at the end of the day people that are thinking long term and people that are focused on building brands are always going to win all right man you're a young guy only 21 years old with massive success made Millions take me through your minds at the time where you really did decide okay I'm gonna start something what was really kind of like the impetus was Christmas break when I was a freshman in college you know it was at the time and so there was like this two-month break between first semester and second semester and so you know during that break I'm back at home I'm like sitting around my house and I was like this is like the perfect time and opportunity to build something and so I did just that and it took it took a year to go from idea to bring it into reality you know it was super slow like I'm not going to sugarcoat it like there were weeks where I wasn't even working on the business because I was waiting on this person or I was waiting on this to get done I was waiting on this thing for this thing like you know it didn't just like kind of like materialize overnight it was a long long long process but once we had product in hand and we had an incredible product that you know I poured my Blood Sweat and Tears into over that year we hit the ground running and in our first three weeks we sold out of all of our inventory and in our first month we had to move to pre-order and we did over 280 000 in Revenue at like 50 net margins because we were just going viral left and right it was absolutely Bonkers and so you know from that point on like I knew that I had something and I knew that I had to like see it through in order to take it to the next level all right let's talk startup costs how much did it cost to start tabs and how much does it cost to start an e-commerce business so I started tabs with thirty thousand dollars total I pretty much drained my entire bank account which came from like all my previous Ventures from when I was younger to go all in on this business so like I don't know if that would be like the average business I think that like honestly you could probably start anything like any sort of econ brand at least with an MVP with like 10 grand I think like the the biggest cost the r d side of things right like the research and development of the the product itself eh and then B like in terms of like developing that sample like that first initial sample once you have that down it's then about finding a manufacturer that's willing to work with you because here's the deal a lot of Manufacturers don't give you the time of day because you're too small so if you could find a manufacturer like a small guy that's like willing to kind of take you under their wing and like that on you you can you can for sure make something happen for sub 10 grand yeah how do you find a small manufacturer that will take a bet on you yeah Google man everything everything is at our fingertips I literally typed in on Google chocolate contract manufacturer I went through all the pages on Google like the first 20 or 25 pages I made a spreadsheet you know collecting their information their name their website link I was just ringing them up I would just literally like make phone calls and dial them up send out emails um and go from there let's talk about marketing I know you've done hundreds of millions of views on Tick Tock and you make most of your business through short form social media yeah can you tell me more about how that works yeah I basically had like hundreds of people that are on my payroll and they're pushing out content every single day they're putting up videos on tick tock on Instagram on YouTube any short form platform you can imagine I'm on it and so through that I've created my own millions of people which in turn drives tens hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales a day and you know on a macro level is responsible for the 11 million dollars plus we're going to do this year and so you actually have a bunch of people that just make content for you yeah dude I have like over like 60 people that make content out of thousands of people that like post the content across a web of accounts what kind of videos are they yeah so I try to make them seem as native as possible consumers are smart if they think it's an app they're not going to watch it so I make the videos like super on par with whatever's trending in the moment whatever sound is popping whatever like movement is happening like whatever it is like my creators are making content around that and then of course we have some like validated Concepts that like push really hard but yeah that's pretty much it so you don't do a lot of like paid ads not really it's like mostly organic it's most like all the content creators and the reposters I do double and paid where like I take my most model creatives and play these meme pages that have tens of millions of followers to post my content and then I also run a little bit of Google ads I do email and text message marketing which is more like kind of bottom of the funnel but yeah I mean for the most part it's a pretty uh crazy organic system that I pioneered all right to close this interview out some people will be watching this that want to start their own brand they want to start their own e-commerce brand potentially what's one thing they can do today to get started the best advice that I can give anybody that's like watching this today is that like I'm not smarter than you I don't have a higher IQ there's a lot of something like special like sauce and I'm gatekeeping literally just go out there and make some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happen and uh never look back and in three or five or ten years from now they're not going to recognize like how much progress you've made because it doesn't just all happen at once it's like every day you're compounding compounding compounding and then one day you wake up and you know you're worth millions of dollars and that's kind of how it is thank you sir foreign

TITLE: I Make $1.3M/Year With One Skill
VIDEO ID: dXKzST0FE-A
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXKzST0FE-A
================================================================================

this guy makes $1.3 million a year with a business model that's going to change the world the product eyes service he invited us into his house to show us exactly how it works how he runs it with zero employees and how he does it all from the comfort of his own home Brad started building this idea while he was working at 9 to5 and the crazy part is he didn't quit his job until he was making $80,000 a month I did all of my work during my zoom calls that I had with my team so the secret behind his business is a pricing strategy that nobody is using and we're going to break down why this is making him one of the highest paid solopreneurs in the world a lot of people say it's like the Netflix of design in this video he shares everything how he launched in 24 hours how he got his first client and how anyone can build a life-changing business while still working your day job I'm Pat walls and this is starter story all right Brett it's absolutely amazing what you've built can you tell me exactly what you do and how you make money yeah so I sell basically design as a subscription uh it's kind of called a product High service which basically means that I sell packages for clients to you know pick and And subscribe to it's about $5,000 a month they get you know certain number of things and I don't have any contractors no employees never have had any sort of help whatsoever so you're telling me you run a $1.3 million a year design agency all by yourself how exactly do you set that up it's really pretty bare Bon so what I do is users subscribe to my service basically every client gets a Trello board they get immediate access to it which is a big selling point of a product I service and they can begin in putting design requests into the queue and they're basically worked on one by one I work on a request for a client every couple days may take 30 minutes to an hour to complete send it to them go through the feedback stages and then rinse and repeat essentially so I do that for all 20 clients I also don't have any meetings with clients so once you're on boarded you know there's no Zoom calls there's no even really any slack commun everything happens async which allows me to basically dedicate my entire day to just design work and that's it take me through process of when you came up with the idea and then getting started with it you know I I always kind of wanted to go into freelancing want to start an agency I knew I didn't want to work for someone else I had done that my whole life wasn't that just wasn't for me and I happened to come across another agency doing something similar to what I'm doing today they were doing it for graphic design but I was a web designer um I did landing pages and product design I thought I could take what they do apply to what I'm good at and just make it the the highest quality option out there so it's basically just taking an idea that already existed in making it better and I built it in a day built it on a Saturday it was essentially just a web flow onepage site that I stood up and set up a trell board kind of structure I launched it on product time which is you know a pretty cliche way of launching a product but yeah it was it was a pretty simple probably took me six seven hours to build and that was it and did you have a full-time job at that time I had a full-time job for 3 and 1 half years running design Joy I quit when I was making 80,000 a month and um I joke because I did all my work dur during my zoom calls that I had with my team so but I did get all my work done I just you know I I was more focused on design joy and it got to the point where I looked back you know 3 and a half years later thought okay maybe this actually is something that I can sustain so I finally made the lead yeah all right Brett so most agencies charged by the hour but you're doing something totally different a product High service can you tell me more about that yeah I mean it's it's basically like instead of charging hourly or having to like quote individual projects and write up proposals for clients I have off the shelf packages that people can choose from and all of them you know include unlimited requests which means you know you're not charge per hour and you pick a plan and no matter how much or how little you use it you end up paying the same price a lot of people say it's basically a retainer well not really a retainer could be anything and you're still tracking time and you're technically paying by hour even though it's packaged up to a fixed price but the way that I work is you know have some clients that end up paying $5,000 an hour if they have one request or 300 if they have several so just the hourly rate depends on you know how many requests clients have how can people like you were before in your 9 to-5 job take their work and productize it and build a business like this I would say like my advice to someone actually wanting to do what I've done is no matter what industry you're in so if you're in content writing if you're in video production or maybe you just create YouTube thumbnails or if you're in design find the things that you're good at and Niche down like for me I'm a designer which means I could technically do a lot of things but there's certain things that I'm good at and that's like you know branding product design landing page design I don't wor really worry about the other stuff cuz I'm not fast at it so like find the things that you're fast at build a package around it like bundle it up come up with pricing that that makes it attractive but also makes it worth your time and then just stand up a website simple as that awesome let's talk about cost to run a product TI service what kind of tools do you use what do you pay for and how much does it cost to run this business yeah so it costs me precisely $176 a month to run design Joy so I use figma for design web flow you know hosting Adobe and shutter stock which is um 100 bucks a month by far my most expensive uh tool that I use so everything else that I use which is a number of tools including Trello and air table I use basically the free versions of it you haven't spent a penny on marketing how did you get clients when you first started and how do you get clients now yeah so I took the route of you know for those unfamiliar with it it's called Product time if you come out new product you can post it on there it has an up voting system tons of hits per day so if you're if you're mildly successful you'll get some interest and some clients right away so I took that route then I eventually again started like building in public joining a bunch of communities today my primary means of getting leads is like basically anytime I tweet so Twitter you know came on board for me about a year ago I was very late to the scene and I built a mild following on the platform and you know that's basically where most of my leads are generated today you're a creative guy you have lots of little side projects and you do more than just design Joy how do you come up with new ideas and test them quickly um I basically do the the bare minimum possible so I I I Know Myself quite well you know with design Joy like I said it was a day I just launched a website a one page site with scribbles it was like a 6our project right um with my course I just like went in my car recorded some audio files and uploaded them and that was it so I'd rather do that than spend weeks months building something that may ultimately fail and waste of bunch of time I'd rather just release something minimally viable out there and see if it bites and if it does then I can figure things out from there all right real quick on the topic of winning ideas I have to tell you about the business that I built it's called starter story and it's literally 4,000 ideas case studies and courses about how regular people build online businesses to millions in Revenue you can get a ton of inspiration from these but we also show you how much money they're making how they came up with their idea and how they grew their businesses to Millions it's only $1 to try it out for 7 days and yes you can cancel it but if you're serious about surrounding yourself with successful Founders who have been there before then definitely check it out at starterstory.com I put the link right below in the bio if you want to try it out back to the video with Brett I hope you enjoy it see you how can other designers or people that want to get into design get good like you yeah I think the big thing it's not fun to hear but the big thing is just doing it you know I did not go to school for design I basically taught myself how to do it and I was you know in design programs all day long basically mimicking good design that was already out there so I I got to understand the tool very well I got to understand how to get get to that end result I surround myself with good design I'm constantly seeking it out I'm constantly on like dble and all these landing page inspo sites and following good designers to kind of stay on top of what's in I did fake projects like I would find a project and like Rebrand it or redesign it as long as you're doing it as long as you're inigma like pushing pixels every day you'll eventually get there [Music] what's a typical day in the life for a solopreneur so for me uh it's it looks like this I mean I wake up about 7:30 in the morning my wife goes to the gym I usually watch the kids till about 10:30 which you could look at as like as a curse but like I look at as blessing cuz that's the time I get to really like dedicate my time and spending with them so I I don't start work until about 11:30 to 12: and then I work till about 4: to 5 in the afternoon and then spend time with the family and changing diapers and doing you know that sort of thing watching TV just pretty boring stuff we don't really go out and do much you know it's hard to with a baby and little kids so we pretty much stay inside um but yeah that's about it do you have any sort of routines or anything like that that you like to do routines no like I'm not a good time manager like surprisingly like you would think that I would be doing this but my escapes so like one thing I like to do is every Friday night I like to play video games with my friends back home like family like my uncle brother like bunch of us get play video games but that's basically the only routine that I have other than watching the kids in the morning and working from that time period and that's that's pretty much it man all right our final question that we asked to all of uh the people that we talked to if you could go back sit on Brett's shoulder when you're first getting started what's the one piece of advice that you would give to him yeah I think for me uh I say this a lot I mean I'm a pretty insecure entrepreneur I don't think I'm alone in that and I may come across as a confident person but I'm really not like I I I see myself below a lot of people so when I when I when I created design Joy I mean there was a reason why I kept a full-time job until I was making 80k a year like that's how insecure I was at actually making this work and so that brought on a lot of stress like what if this doesn't last like what am I going to do what's my backup plan um so it held me it held me back for a long time and put a lot of like strain on my back um so I I would probably tell them like to believe in yourself that like you're capable of doing this doing it and believing that you can as corny as that sounds is what I needed all along because I I was like I almost pictured design Joy is like I equated it to like a shooting star like it happen so quick and I felt like it could dissipate so quickly too so it prevented me from making that leap and like and when you when I made that leap my Revenue doubled the next month like when I left my job to take on design Joy full-time it doubled the next month so like I wasted so much time like double efforts like keeping my main job and keeping that job that like like if I just had confidence in myself I could have like been where I was today like 2 years later or 2 years ago so as cliche as it sounds what it worked for me dope cool well thank you Brett you do design work you'll have a Porsche

because you have to pay for your mortgage or whatever else like you're supporting other people so I was like Now's the Time just take the risk what's the worst thing that can happen I can always go back into a software engineering job and that's when I kind of like decided and then I just became like okay how do we go about it and journaling journaling journaling journaling and then finally one day I was just like this is the end quitting your job for YouTube is a crazy move how much you have saved up do you have a backup plan at the time so I had a lot of Investments um from software engineering luckily that I had put like in retirement account and then like other assets and I was fortunate enough that those assets had grown immensely so I had kind of like a asset I could pull from if I really needed an emergency but in my bank account I think I had like five or ten thousand dollars but I felt comfortable because I had like those assets backing me and I was like if I really need more money I'll sell stuff and I'll use that money but I didn't really want to sell anything at the time but you're able to make it off of five ten thousand at least in the beginning yes uh so luckily YouTube was already making some money I was making I think two to three thousand a month and I was like as long as I can increase that Revenue by focusing more on that then I should be fine so I really just focused on increasing that revenue and I cut my personal costs as low as possible and that's kind of how I lived and for the most part that was helping me and I recently just started paying myself through the business you said that you brought your personal expenses down to basically nothing what did that look like uh that was kind of like moving back into my parents so no rents they paid for food um I didn't have to pay for a car so I had the lucky opportunity that I could lean on them so that was kind of the big thing I was like all right how can I go about using this as as a as a way to kind of not have to spend too much money being a YouTuber for anyone else who wants to do YouTube full-time how much you used to have to spend as a YouTuber you don't have to spend any money and you have to spend all the money I think it's all hard work and dedication like one thing I've really prided myself is trying to meet as many other creators as possible and the big thing you learn from that is a lot of people don't want it they say they want it they're like yeah I want to do this I want to do that or I have this dream but no one wants it if you're hungry enough you could do it that's that's the part that I've realized like so many people just say things but they don't actually put in the work if you put in the work day in day out there's nothing stopping you how can you tell if someone really wants it it's not about how they talk it's about what they publish like are they publishing consistently are they adapting and learning and growing and are they asking questions like one thing I struggle with is asking for help but I've realized that even people who like I'm not a big Creator but people who might be like one step behind me if they ask me for feedback like okay that person is hungry and then I'm like okay maybe I should be asking other people for feedback too so that like shows that you want to learn and you want to get better when you first got started how much time were you spending creating videos and like how many subscribers did you have in the early days I was doing like I think daily Vlogs were were the thing back then so I was like oh I need to publish every single day so I would record during the day edit at night and then publish the next morning and I did a couple like 30 day 90 day challenges um and I think I had like 100 maybe 200 subscribers at the time how many videos were you putting out what was your what was your output look uh I think it was once a week twice a week I still switch between that I'm trying to do like I did three months where I was like we're doing twice a week and then I scaled it back to once a week but for the most part I think twice a week once a week or twice a month are probably like the three best cadences for YouTube is what I've learned and noticed from most people so how long did it take you to get to a thousand subscribers was that a big Mark for you I've heard this great quote 100 subscribers is the hardest a thousand is the next hardest ten thousand is a little bit harder 100 000 is a little easier and then a million is even easier and I think it's because the Snowball Effect right I I don't remember how long it took me to get to like a thousand but I remember it was like years like two years maybe uh just posting content and I wasn't really analyzing what was bringing in subscribers I was just posting out of like oh this is fun I like this let's just keep doing it um but it took like two maybe three years and how long did it take to make your first dollar through your videos so before the one thousand four thousand hours limit that YouTube had I was monetized and I was making like ten dollars a month within the first year that I started YouTube and then they created that cap and I was under the 1000 subscribers so they cut off my money and I think I made like 300 over a year but that was the first like couple dollars that came in and you couldn't get the money until you hit 100 threshold so I was like I would see it right we need 20 more to get the cash and how did you make that money was it just through YouTube AdSense that first it was all YouTube AdSense I know you make money through lots of different ways now uh how did you find those and what does that look like for you I started to make videos that were kind of search based um and like we were product reviews like one of them was like a fitness tracker band and I was like oh they gave me like a referral link you know sometimes they say oh put your link in the app like oh you get one month three if you refer someone so it's like all right let's do it so I put that link in there and the video got some views and then all of a sudden I had three years of membership and I was like what do I do with this and then I became 10 years of membership and I was like what do I do with this so then the company reached out to me and they're like hey we have an affiliate program um it's invite only do you want to be in it and I think of course like what am I going to do with 10 years of membership so that was the first time they're like okay here's your link instead of getting a free month which was like I don't know 30 bucks or something we'll give you 50 dollars and I was like all right that sounds better like a cash over like this thing that is not really like attainable and that was the first time that I started to get like some amount of cash and I was like all right let's replace that link and then I was like okay so it looks like if I make a product review and people are searching the review and I provide value um and some people will decide not to buy it because of my video and some people will and if I tell them to use my link then I can make some money so that helps support making more videos could you break down all the different ways that you make that you make money as YouTuber I know affiliate marketing YouTube AdSense maybe do you have any brand deals could you break it all down for us yeah um right now it's just affiliate marketing and YouTube AdSense I'm starting to get into sponsorships but I don't really want to yet because I want to like optimize for watch time and I don't know it's like a fear that maybe if I put a sponsorship in like views are gonna drop I think it's probably like 80 20 20 is YouTube AdSense 80 is uh affiliate marketing and then Within like there's two major companies that cover most of the AdSense probably around 50 of that and then the rest is like a whole bunch of other small um companies this is my bedroom very tiny New York City boy yeah so living in New York City is obviously really expensive how are you able to live in New York as a Creator um you just have to give out an arm and a leg I think part of it I was lucky and fortunate enough to meet two other creators who were also chasing the same thing and we're like we figured out what we wanted to prioritize and for me it was like location I want to be surrounded by other creators and we know a lot of other creators who kind of live near this area and then the second aspect was save as much plenty as possible so we try to find the cheapest place where all three of us could live in and this was it like it provided bedrooms for all of us it has a nice big living room so that way we can like have our desks and create content it kind of got our basic needs met so it's just cut costs as low as possible and get like your high priority items yeah and that's it and how much does this place cost for rent in the whole place and in this room we pay 4 500 for three of us so me and my roommate changes we pay 1600 and then uh Colt our third roommate pays the rest and do you eat out a lot or what how do you saving money I'm trying to cut that down so actually one video I'm working on is how to make homemade meals in less than two minutes and save money that way as well as like optimize time so I have like a little Smart Oven thing that I use and that helps me like cook most of my meals nice and what are the other big expenses as a new NYC Creator what is it other than rent and food what do you spending coffee this place is so small like it's nice to just change your environment and go outside somewhere so I like to go work at a coffee shop or meet people at a coffee shop that's probably my biggest expense and then gym I love working out so there was a time where I had two gym memberships but now I don't um but like going to the gym or a sauna and and cold plunge Studio like that's another cost so I would say health and wellness costs are pretty high anything you really want to do in New York City it's like almost double the price sometimes yeah I think that's a good segue to go check out a coffee shop and right say coffee coffee shop cut the coffee shop all right so what's been your most like successful or viral video on YouTube it was definitely the I replaced my iPhone with an Apple Watch Ultra I think it's around 1.56 million views right now and what's the story behind it so that's like been a video I've done a couple times before and the intention behind it was like can I survive with just my Apple watch like I'm always consuming social media on my phone and I want to just like get rid of my phone so I was like can I do 24 hours just Apple watch and I've done it before and it did pretty well I was like all right the new Apple watch is coming out let's launch this video at the same time that all the Apple watch Ultra hype is happening so as soon as I got the watch I did the video literally the next day and I tried to release it as fast as I could like I I don't think the editing was great it was just like get it out now why do you think it went viral timing uh topic uh and just having previous data that like this style could potentially work so I think there's a factor of those three things like I know this video has worked for me in the past timing of Apple watch Ultra and then the topic people love Apple watches yeah yeah and how did it feel like you're getting like all this views Was it crazy I think I was like oh I really don't care I was like it's not about the views like yeah having one viral video is is cool I guess but like I want to have an Engaged audience and engaged community and all those 1.5 million people watch the video and never come back like what's the point I want people to come back I gotta I'd rather have consistently a hundred thousand views than one video that gets like 10 million views so that's kind of my goal you got a team working with you now how do you find good editors and good filmers and good people to work with um I think it's Network either through other Creator friends to ask them hey do you know anyone who has is available for work uh going to different events and meeting people and then asking them that's probably the biggest one and and then online like upwork is a good spot it's hard to find good people you really have to like go through like hundreds of people to finally find a good editor that's kind of how I found my first one it was cheap I think they were like seven to ten dollars an hour yeah and if you Outsource it to other countries then you can save a ton of money that way yeah all right so sure what would be your advice for anyone that maybe is in a full-time job right now and wants to create content for a living or be a Creator or just to get start creating start creating I think uh take a day one day a week like your Sundays and dedicate that day to creating content and just start building momentum because that's the most important thing if you're not consistently creating then it's not worth quitting your job you have to first build the momentum build the habits of actually doing it and you have to sacrifice like some of your social life you have to sacrifice other things in your life but I think it's important to just get the ball rolling you're doing videos on Tech and gadgets and fitness how do you find ideas for videos yeah it's just a lot of searching on YouTube like I'll search the topic like right now I'm doing a testosterone supplements video um and one thing is like I can search like the supplements called Tomcat alley so it's like I could search that it's like okay these videos aren't doing that well but if I do testosterone supplements maybe that is doing well but if I do a video about gaining muscle like oh that's going to do extremely well so yeah the video might be about the same thing but it's like how do I frame it and it's about researching and then all right what's kind of related to this and then looking at other videos kind of related to that and then just kind of going down a rabbit hole of a whole bunch of YouTube videos to finally figure out what's the best way to kind of frame this video uh and then just chasing my Curiosities like I'm a very curious person I like to think so if I'm like I want to learn about this I must know like what happens if you do this then that kind of becomes an idea and then it becomes how do I package that idea yeah do you believe it's important to to surround yourself with creators I think anything you're trying to achieve you must surround yourself with people who are also doing the same thing you know the five chimps Theory you become like the people you're surrounded by um so I'm a big believer in that and that's why I destroyed myself with other creators and then how did I go about finding them it was just I went to Creator events so like I think I looked on Meetup or random things like that once you move to a new city it's just like you're just searching online to find whatever you can and then as soon as you meet one then they start to invite you to other events and it becomes like The Snowball Effect where once you have at least like five Creator friends like they know about other events and it becomes this kind of word of mouth thing um and it's just like going to these dinners going to any kind of event that's based around creating content you get to meet other people who are also doing the same thing and it's kind of lonely I would say a lot of creators like it's there's not that many creators in the world right people who are actually serious about it so when you do meet other people who are also in the space like it's just like an instant bond because you know the challenges that they've been through um and you know like this person is also hungry like they're not just like here to like lollygag I heard that you're trying to run a five minute mile how's that going I got injured but I'm gonna do it um I am I want to do it uh if you know a guy named Dr Andrew huberman I recently learned that he his fastest time is a 457 so that's my new goal is I want to beat his time in the mile um I think it's like one thing as I'm getting older is like my body is I've hit the age room my body's deteriorating every year so I just want to see like what am I physically capable of doing and I also want to use that as a goal to build these long-term habits for longevity of just staying healthy with my cardiovascular system but I did get injured but I'm slowly getting back into running and I'm like I need to take a safe approach I'm not a 21 year old Invincible man uh just about you know maybe this is not going to take longer than two months like it's gonna take a year two years but chase after that goal yeah and how close did you get uh 526 is my fastest time so far it's pretty good yeah pretty good almost there almost there okay make sure to like And subscribe turn on your notifications don't ever put that in a YouTube video

TITLE: He Built A $600,000 One Person Business (with video editing)

================================================================================

I never made more than like 40 50k a year out of college and that's pre-tax so I was broke so I packed up my car drove like 1200 miles away that's where I kind of learned how to like talk to people Network do customer service write blogs all right so today we're meeting up with Scott he makes 50 000 a month making videos and he's going to show us exactly how he does it [Music] so yeah tell me tell me about what you do what do you want yeah so we run uh basically it's a productized service for B2B SAS companies so think about like an agency service except you're able to buy it kind of like an e-commerce product so it's it's short animated videos for B2B SAS companies to run as paid ads and and get customers in the door what's a typical client for who we work with we work with software companies that are primarily B2B so they have platforms like you think of stripe like a payment processor or something like that and they're typically also funded so an important part about selling something like a productized service is making sure that the people have the money to actually buy what you're selling so we found that companies that are VC backed or have gone through like um seed and series a funding they typically have the money to to purchase what we're selling so that's what works best for us and companies want this because it helps sell more of their product or helps their brand Market better the main goal with the videos is not necessarily to directly get our clients more customers it's more so to get the potential customers to like stop scrolling or to maybe go book a demo or something like that right it's more of like the scroll stopper some people call it where it's super attention grabbing but it doesn't give you enough information to actually like go buy the service or product tell me a little bit more about your background you were doing actual video agency work yeah so I've done I've done everything I've done like music videos event Recaps you know me and a friend used to shoot weddings and just like basically everything I've also been a designer built websites all this stuff and for me videos what really stuck and then it was hard for me to scale and it was it was hard to get work I didn't really know what I was doing so I ended up stumbling onto Twitter and meeting you know a lot of the people what they call Like Money Twitter right and that's really all about how can you take what you already know how to do which for me was the video production stuff and monetize it at a higher level and then that's when I kind of got into all the technical technical business stuff you go to college or anything like that uh I went for two months and dropped out I think why did you drop that what happened yeah so I ended up meeting this guy and he's like hey I'm I'm starting this business in Colorado you know we're going to try to like help people manage vacation rental properties like I think you'd be a good fit for it so I packed up my car drove like 1200 miles away I hadn't had any actual business experience prior to that but that's where I kind of learned how to like talk to people Network do customer service write blogs stuff like that that was in 2019 I think so I was 19. yeah when I did that so now you're only like what 24 23 yeah I didn't really make any money until the last like year even though I tried all this stuff after college I mean it was all just learning you know I never made more than like 40 50k a year out of college so I mean and that's pre-tax so I was broke yeah you know the three and a half years after I left but I was able to leverage my skills and this is something for like a lot of people too that they can they can use is like if you have a specific skill if you can find ways not just to make money with it but like for me for example because of the video stuff I've gotten to like go shoot at NASCAR in the pit and just a bunch of cool stuff even though I wasn't getting paid very well for that it was stuff that I was able to add to my resume of just things that you're able to do has video always been your passion I've been doing videos since 2016 and it it started off actually as I opened up Adobe Illustrator Junior High School to make like these presentations for some business class I was in and then that evolved into me getting a camera and trying out photography and then photography got boring so I tried out video um and then now it's kind of an intersection of of all of them with what I'm doing because it's like design but it's moving and all that stuff but really personally like I enjoy anything creative so I've I've painted I've you know I used to like play some instruments just really any anything like that so your business took off and you said you're making fifty thousand dollars a month now is that right yeah on average it bounces around a little bit with any business right like it could be like 35 then it could be like 55 right yeah just depends on your lead Insurance you know before that you were making maybe 50 000 a year and you grew to pretty much 10x that was there any mindset shift or was there anything that really set this business apart from others if if I was going to choose one thing it would be switching from a scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset and it sounds really I guess like cheesy or like or whatever if you make the shift to taking those same resources again whether it's money the knowledge Network you have right in just full-on like utilizing them to try to produce more of what you have and grow that I think the whole game changes before this business you had kind of a lot of creative type jobs you were doing video how could someone who is is also creative an artist a videographer anyone in doing production how can they turn that into a business and be able to work for themselves speaking from what worked for me I think that the biggest thing one get on social media right and I'll use Twitter as an example because that's again what worked for me so what I would do is be posting every day sit down for an hour schedule it out be consistent and write things or make reels or whatever you're going to do about things specific to what you're doing are so if it's video make educational content for Brands about how they can get more customers in the door with video right that's kind of what I did and then once you have that down once you're consistently posting you get a feel for it and you're learning about the specific platform that you're posting to then that's when you can start actually selling a service what works best for that is the productized model we talked about so again if you're doing something like video right there's a ton of different things you could do you could design thumbnails for YouTube you could do an on-demand video editing service you could do a color grading service right and come up with like a specific offer and packages to sell or some kind of offer structure where let's say your main package is three thousand dollars a month then you can have a down sell or an upsell or whatever right and so what that might look like is certain deliverables inside of a package and a deliverable would be like we'll color grade this many videos in this specific way for this amount of money if you can have a service that people need is recurring and you can find the people who have the money to buy it then there's there's really no stopping you yeah and you think that's more effective than just I guess selling your time to do some some video work for you know a few hours 100 packaging your your skill set is much more effective because you're in control of what you're charging you're being paid for your expertise not your actual time so if you had an a person and a b person and they both had 10 years of experience maybe you say a person is getting paid hourly even if it's 500 an hour right like they're a lawyer or something and then B person is selling a a productized service they're still going to make 10 times more because they could sell what person a is doing for 500 an hour maybe it takes them 10 hours and then person B can then charge five thousand dollars give them the same result and so technically person a and person B are being compensated the same the person B can go and then hire people to help them fulfill that right and so it's just this whole this whole scaling thing is is where you make the real money do you have any employees or is it just you yeah so I started off by myself and now we have a team of about four so I don't have any full-time employees but I have like a couple full-time contractors and then some like a closer in fractional roles that help me do certain things operationally yeah and my team is is also International as well how's that work it's great because I mean for a lot of reasons but they get paid you know more than they would make where they are and my team's pretty young too like younger than me so it's cool to be able to give people you know like when I back when I was 18 like I would have loved to be doing what they're doing now yeah and so it's it's cool to bring that full circle and be able to pay someone what they're worth more than they would make where they live you know they can work remote they're not my employees so they take trips and stuff and take work off so that's that's been enjoyable too and how do you find really good talent there's a lot of ways but when you start building an audience people will naturally want to work for you because they believe in what you're doing and they think that what you're doing is cool so all the people that are working for me right now reached out to me and the reason I hired them is because I know if they're reaching out to me that they're really dedicated and motivated to get done what they want to do and it's turned out to be true so far so how much does it cost to run your business like generally speaking monthly so we have a tech stack that is and then there's also Payment Processing fees and stuff like that um in terms of like labor it's hard to put a put a put a pin on that because it's completely dependent on how many videos we're doing are gross profit margins um are about 65 and then net is probably between 40 and 50 just depending on a couple things but in terms of our the tech stack is really the only one thing that we consistently spend money on yeah on a monthly basis what do you mean by Tech stack so okay so we have the cold email sending software the software that we run the list through I have to pay for slack you know we use stripe which is free but we paid the fee on that Tech stack specifically is probably like twelve hundred dollars a month and that's so that's just what we use to be able to actually execute the services that we sell right I notice you mentioned building an audience what does that look like for you just posting consistently um and finding a niche too when you think of a niche like it has to be really specific like super specific so at first it was just videos for me and then it became short videos like no longer than 60 seconds right and then it became short videos for online Brands and then it went to short videos for online brands that are B2B SAS companies did you see the business grow when you kept niching down like that yes because it made it very obvious like who our product was for it's counterintuitive too because like when you the more people you say like no you're not a fit then the faster you'll find people that will actually buy from you have you been able to raise your prices because of this niching down that you've done yeah we've we the first video we sold was five hundred dollars and we've basically Timex our prices so now our average order value is like 3K but we sell we just introduced some new packages that have been selling really well from anywhere from six to twelve what advice would you have just for anyone that wants to get started with an online business what's the first step do things like go on YouTube and do research on what you actually want to do and then I would spend as much money as you can afford on coaching and programs that are fit on what direction you wanna you wanna go from people that are reputable not not lamb burgers this is where I get a lot of my work done we got the the nice aperture light set up here and trust the old 16-inch MacBook Pro so we actually coincidentally just closed the deal right as we started filming this so nope it's got a 400 sale we've got starter stories a good luck charm so we're gonna send this contract out and then talk a little bit about how we got here in the first place you said you'd grown it from zero to fifty thousand pretty much in a year what did that look like did you start with just like 5 000 a month how did that grow we kind of started how we are still now but we sophisticated our offer so before it was you'll buy one video it'll basically be whatever length and it's a flat fee essentially what we did now is we created a package so you're not only buying you can still buy one video but we use this as a down sell now if someone doesn't want to buy the package with the packages it's a set of videos and then we reformat that set of videos so that people can run it on all the platforms and things like that and then we also will set up retargeting ads for them we won't run them but we'll do a bunch of setup and stuff like that so that it's an offer that's more inclusive of what the end goal is rather than just here as a video it actually sets them up for Success yeah so when you started repackaging your offering like that is that when you started to see the growth in terms of I guess like financially yeah because in terms of monthly like Revenue it was like 7K then 5K then 9k and then we went to like 12 23 33 and I would say what we introduced that offer when we were struggling to get above like 12km Yeah because it just wasn't the one videos were sophisticated enough and the ticket price wasn't high enough to bring us past that right how did you find your first customer what's been your main channel for growth yeah so there's been a couple different ones some work better than others but primarily we've done Twitter we've done cold email we've done like direct dming so like on sales navigator on LinkedIn or through Twitter and really I mean keeping it simple like it's just really cold Outreach and then the organic content reaching out to people for the viewers who don't know a lot about cold Outreach what does that typically look like like how many uh cold emails are you sending and what what's like your lead response rate that sort of stuff you got to send a lot and for our ICP which is stands for ideal customer profile specifically the open rate or reply rate for software is only about they're two different things the reply rate is really only like four four percent typically on average so you know you're talking about reaching out to thousands of people and then when you get those people to reply now all of them will book a call with you either right um so it's kind of you just have to do the math depending on what your numbers look like um and in terms of you know what a cold email looks like it's basically it's really simple it's basically two sentences it's like hey you know we noticed on your site that you don't have a video like above the fold on your landing page that's something we do like have you ever looked into that and that's it you know a lot of people will write like a huge paragraph and like no one has a title right so how does the sales process work for anyone that's running kind of a productized service what would you recommend doing or yeah so to break it down really simply you'll basically have like top of funnel you have like the middle of the funnel and then you have bottle funnel so top of funnel for us is organic social posting the DMS in cold email and then the ads right so like those three things what happens is a certain amount of people convert from top of funnel to the middle of the funnel so someone will open the email someone will see a post of ours or even both sometimes people will open an email and then go check out my LinkedIn profile right and then they'll book a call either directly to our socials or on the website and that's kind of the middle funnel and the bottom of the funnel is like getting on a sales call with my closer then either buy or not buy essentially yeah so it's yeah it's basically those three main parts where did you learn this B2B and um so the coaching and then just trying it out yourself yeah so the coaching is good for like at least for me like I felt like pretty directionless I was like oh you know I know I want to have an online business but I don't know where to start I don't know like what kind of stuff to watch but you're dedicated and you know you want to do it so I spent the money in the coaching the coaching gave me an hour line and Direction and then I took that direction and I tried it myself so for example the cold email stuff I knew enough to actually just try it I didn't know enough to do it and then you start doing it more and through repetition you get you get better at it yeah so same thing with the sales calls like I'm not a salesperson like I don't like doing it and but I've probably taken like 150 sales calls and then once I took enough sales calls to have a structure to it I gave that to someone to do for them what's your schedule what's a typical day for you like wake up at 7 30 start working by like eight or eight thirty drink a ton of coffee and in terms of actually working I probably sit at my desk you know eight hours a day pretty normal working amount and then you know an hour or two is also just spent like thinking like walking and stuff like that when I'm actually sitting at my desk what I'm doing is project management so I'm in slack channels you know communicating with clients implementing feedback delivering products to them things like that a certain top portion of my time is spent doing organic content so writing I'm going to be recording more videos um planning stuff out for that and then um also consuming a certain amount of content you know obviously try not to consume too much yeah but maybe threads about building your business and stuff like that so like a certain amount is fulfillment some of it is sales and overseeing some of the people that work with me and then just trying to get better every day yeah do you work on the weekends yeah um so the thing about weekends for me personally is if I if I don't I don't work like eight hours on Sunday and eight hours on Saturday but I find that if I don't work at all on the weekends I lose some sort of like momentum or I feel like I'm coming back into my business and I've been gone for a week exactly so on that same note vacation you take time off or do you take time to recharge or anything like that yeah so I actually recently took off that's the other cool thing about having a business though is like you don't have like PTO necessarily you can kind of do it when you want as long as you have some sort of system in place um but yeah I recently I recently went out to California for like a week and then another cool thing is because it's fully remote like I could go on like a working trip and still work but have a refreshed you know environment to work in yeah foreign if there's one last thing something I hear really often is like you know follow your passion it's kind of like follow instead of following your passion like save your passion for what you want to do outside of work what you should really be doing at least in my experience is following what you're good at and you like doing because if you find something you're good at and you enjoy doing you're ahead of 99 of people already yeah and then you can just save your passion for because you don't want to make your passion yeah yeah so and if you're good at something it's a lot easier to just kind of do it every day even when you're not making any money it's like if you're good at something it feels good to do it therefore and yeah and so for me that was video I used to do them for free you know like way back when I was like 16 I used to do them for free and my mom was like you need to start charging money for these I was like oh really like and now we're here so yeah yeah
