================================================================================

Ryan reyolds required over 2 million customers for mmobile with paid ads and I'm going to break down the best paid ads that he's run and how you can model the structure for whatever it is that you sell in your marketing I'm Alex rosi I'm the founder of ais.com we spend millions of dollars every month on ads we make tons of money and no one cares let's start with the first ad at mintmobile we like to do the opposite of what big Wireless does they charge you a lot we charge you a little they put their names on Arenas we put ours on my lower back so naturally when they announced they'd be raising their prices due to inflation we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you and if this were one of their ads they'd end it here with a happy customer so we'll end outs with an angry goat look at the angry goat okay so let's break this down frame by frame now notice though that this is a 30-second ad let's start with the beginning of the ad at M mobile we like to do the opposite of what big Wireless does pause so right here the hook is is basically a contrarian hook so there's a little bit of curiosity here because you're like okay well one you recognize Ryan Reynolds right off the bat and he's got brand placement behind him so he's making the association between him the thing you like and the thing you might not know which is mintmobile and so that's a 101 strategy and there's a reason that I wear this hat and why underneath of my shirt which normally is unbuttoned for those of you who are you wild fellows the reason I I I I rep my brand is to make that same Association if there stuff that you use for my content and it makes you money then hopefully you associate that value with me and acquisition. all right all right so here this is a contrarian hook and uh the curiosity is okay well what's opposite about this thing versus what I my current carrier all right let's hit it they charge you a lot we charge you a little okay pause so this is a clear setup for an Us Versus Them strategy all right and so this strategy is best employed when you are not the market leader all right so obviously mmobile is kind of the underdog they're going the small guy they're trying to face Goliath obviously they're not even close to as big as Verizon and AT&amp;T so uh this strategy makes sense if you're number one you don't want to do US versus them if anything if you want to use an Us Versus Them structure you would use US versus the alternative so rather than another brand or other companies you would be like us versus your couch right if you were like the top fitness brand or something like that they put their names on Arenas we put ours on my lower back so pause so here obviously he's weaving in humor because that's part of his personal brand and so he's basically weaving in kind of like his brand sub bullets as he's going through now every ad has has three parts to it right you're going to have the hook which we covered right at the beginning there's the meat of the ad which is typically going to be the value and then uh at the end of the ad uh there's usually going to be either some sort of call action or a payoff but let's keep going so naturally when they announced they'd be raising their prices due to inflation we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you all right so here the value is so think about when you're thinking about value Creation in an ad um there's at the most basic level more good stuff less bad stuff all right and so when you're you're writing your ads or you're writing your copy and you're scripting them out I think first from those two buckets and so if we pull out our handy dandy textbook for advertising and you go to 134 so this is the leads book so there's the steps for running paid ads so first uh you have to know where to advertise he's advertising everywhere because everyone already knows who he is and everyone already has a cell phone and so his Market is everyone right now that Parts straightforward the second part is like okay how do I get the right people to see it that's via targeting so I'm sure there's different audiences that look that do better and it might be for Discount providers rather than people who are maybe at premium they might have found for example that uh you know switching someone from Verizon might be more difficult than switching someone from like maybe uh pay on the pay as you go type phone especially given the price points now the third part which is right here step three what should my ad say and so this mirrors that three-step process you got your call out which is the hook you got the value which is the meat and then you got the call to action which is the end besides the kind of General uh uh points that I start that are more common hooks obviously there's not exhaustive you can have unlimited types of hooks that could fit in a book but in terms of uh Concepts he's using contrast here contrast in two ways one is that there's contrast visually like this is a bright color this is something that's going to pop out but then also he's using contrast US versus them that's kind of the theme here all right now from a value perspective we get into the interest step all right and so the interest step is the best ads make benefits look as big as possible and the costs look as small as possible and so from the benefits and cost perspective what we're basically doing is a reverse value equation and so the good stuff is what's the outcome they want which should be phone coverage right you people would want it fast they would want it easy and they would want it to be likely okay now the negative side is going to be what is a nightmare scenario the worst case scenario um slow hard and risky and so as he's describing the benefit here which is less bad stuff the nightmare scenario is that you pay a lot right and you get basically the same thing and if this were one of their ads they'd end it here with a happy customer and pause and so before this he said and we do this due to not hating you right and so again he's he's talking about the knights mercen they charge you more and they don't like you and so he's saying we charge you less and we do like you by implication and then he adds in more humor so let's see it so we'll end our with an angry C look at the angry goat pause so obviously puts a little bit more humor in and to be clear he doesn't actually show an angry customer he shows a sheep right and so it wasn't actually like showing a negative R which other companies like liquid death which is a water company which took the you know took the took the market by storm with cans of water that looked like beer um they actually had ads that were one-star reviews of their product because they kind of went again contrast that contrarian Angle now here we finish with what the CTA right so they make the offer and they tell people mintmobile.com and what do I get unlimited now speed just relative to the cost low done fundamentally sound ad um and obviously brought lots and lots and lots of customers in so if we're thinking about this ad in three slices right we've got our hook we've got our meat or value and we've got our CTA all right and so we covered the hook we covered the CTA let's talk about the meat and so here we've got more good stuff or less bad stuff now on the uh good stuff what we're what we're thinking through here is how can we make it faster so we want describe speed if we can how can we make it easier and how can make it risk-free now if we wanted to improve this offer it would be month-to month not just monthly right now there's some disclosures at the bottom what does it say there limited time only offer Now new activation and upfront payment for three months there we go uh promotion rate for the first three months only again so now we get to understand oh it's only $15 a month for three months and then it will go to who knows maybe it goes to 30 we'll find out taxes and fees are extra so there is more on top of that and what are these fees that they haven't disclosed and unlimited customers using 35 gbt per month will experience lower speeds okay so they do slow you down and video streams at 480p seful terms at mobile.com all right and so that is the fine print on this but big picture though if we wanted to make this more compelling we would actually flip those things we would say okay well your dream outcome is to have unlimited fast right internet and you're not going to worry about getting overcharged or getting your rates turned down in terms of the speed that you're getting downloaded that would make this offer significantly more compelling right now the thing that a lot of people don't do in their advertising is is they don't cover what I call the don't right which is like what's the negative side all right so here less negative um is the uh what are all the things that suck so paying money sucks um which would be and the opposite this is slow uh hard and risky right now in this ad obviously they don't really have that offer uh because a lot of the things they have are they will they will slow you down um they probably made signing up easy they might not make canceling easy um and then the risk is that obviously you don't get what you want now on top of this this is the real don't this is the 2011 version of ads is that we say okay well plus minus so more bad stuff and less good stuff right that happens in your life These are still the same categories but when we when we sell against the don't we say well you could also not do this and instead you say you will have more delays by not buying mintmobile uh it'll be harder for you to use your phone stuff and uh it will be riskier for you to do it that's uh more bad stuff and also you'll experience less good stuff right and so each of these so you can think about these as mirror images of both sides if you do it with us then you're going to have uh less slowness less hardness less risk which means that it's risk-free it's easy and it's fast these just give you different ways of more or less saying the same thing and on the alternative side when we're marketing against someone or some or some idea or some competitor then we're saying basically the converse of that so let's let's break down the next ad Wireless for 20 bucks a month pause so what's interesting about this is they began not really with a hook but they began with the offer and so me right off the bat I'm not like oh now I'm paying attention I would be like all right there's an offer here fine all right continue that's not right pause so the good part that they have here is I do think that they have a reaction which I think is overall like a good thing um I wonder if I were to split test this I would probably Lop off the offer and start at the reaction and then and then flip the order so that then you see the uh the offer just so that there's something interesting there now here they have a mascot which shows up in the next frame I think what the intention here was to take Ryan reynolds's face away from stuff uh and transition it more to a mascot but my guess here is that his Goodwill and his positive brand is probably what drives a great deal of the advertising return above par uh because many people might not know mmobile if it weren't for Ryan Reynolds they might not even know that this is the same company as his all right keep going I choose chunky style milk because it has the wholesome chunks growing kids need pause so right here they're actually doing um is a pretty clever advertising tactic whether or not it was effective is you know predetermined by the fact that they didn't have as many sales as they wanted so I'm giving you a little bit of a foreshadowing here but what they did is they actually just drew an analogy between their service sorry other people's Service uh and chunky milk so this is another contrast style ad they're saying we are a Ferrari they are a clunker right they are a vesa or whatever some small scooter something that's a a huge contrast that basically paints an analogy in someone's head to say we are good they are bad and we keep going the way that branding works is that you don't actually brand in the negative I can't say hey don't think about pink elephants and me well of course you're going to think about pink elephants and now I forever am Associated for those of you who see this with a pink elephant and I will just cry myself to sleep every night because of it but the point here is is that they said we don't want think we want chunky milk and we started the the the video starts with the actual uh brand itself and then subsequently follows with chunky milk and almost the entire ad is talking about chunky milk and that it's disgusting right and so people now just simply associate mmobile disgusting thing all right let's keep going unlike smooth style milk hey guys safe some chunks for me pause so now they complete the loop and say that's not right kind of like your wireless Bell which is a a simile if you want to use kind of like sort of is basically drawing an equivalent between two things which by the way is one of the key ways of educating and advertising with that we still have this character that no one really knows uh which is this random minty Fox uh but he now I think did he have glasses in the begin I don't know anyway let's keep going oh that's not right all right stop so they hit the three here right it's easy it's online which to me would be it's fast like it's not something that you have to talk to anybody so that's taking away some of the the pain associated now they don't really hit risk-free but I guess they kind of lower the risk again with the small price here um and you have clear call to action which is the end of the ad let's hit it right now buy one month and get two months free at mintmobile.com right and so they have their offer and then obviously the call to action is just simply go to the website all right so I think the the mistakes in the ad are that they B they that branding Works whether you like it or not associations occur and so they branded themselves with chunky milk and they took out their biggest uh star which was Ryan Reynolds and so unsurprisingly uh the ad didn't perform as well all right let's go to a good one hey it's Ryan Reynolds owner of mint mobile pause all right so what we're what he's doing here is he's because what we have to think about when you're advertising here because I don't actually think this is an effective Hook from a hook perspective but because this is fundamentally not going to strangers this is going to people who already know who Ryan Reynolds is and so the equivalent to that would be if I'm in a local area and I run an ad and I say hey Talon locals which is a sub you know sub suburb in in Baltimore which is where I'm from then people are going to be like oh this is for me I recognize something one of the four elements of of getting influence with someone is likeness or relatability you're like oh I I know this guy all right so let's do the next one it's the holidays and the big wireless companies are busy spending billions on Advertising all right pause so yet again he continues to hit on this US versus them uh concept and obviously it's working so when you do have something that works keep keep doing it um and so he's drawing this parallel between us and them yet again all right keep going at mint we're not into wasting money so we bought this spiffy stock footage for $500 all right pause so he he delivers One Core brand message here which is that we're not into wasting money now they're a budget option and so it makes sense for this that this ad did significantly better one they have their their main person two he's the focal point three the scripting itself it's like oh you know who I am and I'm not like these guys my value is cheapness and so we made this ad cheaply because we value money that's kind of like I would say the implication of the ad all right let's keep going our footage also came with another hand so we can let you know so he obviously weeps in humor to then transition to the offer and so these ads are super short ads but when you have an ad that's this short and it's going to audiences who know who you are you pretty much just make an offer and so from an advertising perspective Eugene Schwarz has something called the levels of awareness and so the levels of awareness kind of are like this reverse pyramid all right and so you have unaware at the top and this is about the problem so unaware you have a problem aware so they know that they have the a problem you have solution aware you have product aware and then you have most aware when you make your hooks for ads you actually make your hooks depending on what part of this funnel you're actually finding people and so the colder the traffic the the the more different the ad will be now when you have it unaware ad if you've ever seen something that's like Texas homeowners are getting uh reimbursement checks for up to X XYZ in this area or something that's going to drive curiosity and so curiosity is usually the very top of funnel for people who have no idea what this thing could be about and so it has nothing to do with what the with the solution if you've seen like five weird foods that that help you lose stomach fat it doesn't say whether they're going to sell you a detox tea they're going to sell you a zic they're going to sell you a gym membership it starts all the way at the top with curiosity now here's the massive advantage that branded ads people who are already recognized this is what the rock this is what Ryan Reynolds has Etc now every business can do this every influencer business you see who has 50,000 followers and then begins to run ads for example you still use the same exact strategy that Ryan Reynolds is doing the thing is is just that his warm audience is like everyone whereas your warm audience might be like a milon people and so what he's running actually is an ad that's targeted at most aware and so when you're targeting most aware consumers you actually just make an offer that's it and so that's fundamentally what this ad does he just draws a contrast and says by the way we're cheap and you can buy 3 months free and get 3 months free that's it that's the whole ad so in my next book that is coming out I talk about this particular offer structure which is a buy X get y right and so he's got a a parallel structure buy three get three um I would say that I found that buy one get two or buy three get six if you can contrast that you get more free than you pay for it will typically convert better than a mirror structure so I would test buy one get two versus three and three because you would probably uh end up getting you would save money as a business and you might end up still converting more because the discrepancy between what people pay and what they get is higher if you switch to Mint you'll get 3 months free on all of our plans even unlimited feels like that deserves an exclam Point whoa easy easy so he's just explaining the offer here and I I mean if I wrote this ad I'd probably have the CTA um this is yet another joke that he weaves in you could say that this is on brand for him so what's one of the nice things I think Ryan Reynolds does for his own personal brand is that he does weave in direct response advertising which is what this is with what some people might consider branding and so he does very much kind of brand himself in these ads because the ads are funny and he kind of like if you literally look at this ad it pretty much alternates humor moves the ad forward humor moves the ad forward humor moves the ad forward and it's a pretty simple structure in terms of how he's making this and so what we're doing here as we're looking through this in terms of tools is that one obviously he's a he's a celebrity so we just looked at his YouTube video and and ranked the the the videos that have the highest views but I can guarantee you virtually that the ads that are are doing the best are the ones that are being pushed out every single day on meta on YouTube Etc from ads not organic like sure he might get some signups from the 6 and half million views but believe it or not 6 half million views for an ad not that much right now we're pulling up the Facebook ads campaign so if you don't know how to do this by the way you just go faceb just Google Facebook ads library and then you sort and then you type in the the account that you're looking at and it's because Facebook is trying to be transparent they show you every ad that is running for an account and sometimes also ads that are running in the past now the rule of thumb here in terms of looking for ads because you're like well how do I know which one's working well the easy way to do it is just say which one of these ads has been running for a long time and so the longer the ad's been running the more likely that that ad has worked well and so let's say you put out 100 pieces of creative anything that's new will always do better than something that's old but if something is old for a while then it means even though it's old it's still performing really really well so here are some of the oldest ads that they're running so let's let's pull it up wow this is boring okay um despite the fact that uh I think this ad fundamentally from a creative perspective kind of sucks uh it's been running for 5 years or six years so it's probably doing okay now I will bet that this is a retargeting campaign and so this is probably converting very well for people who have already seen some of the top of funnel ads and so um basically if you think about this levels of awareness that I was just talking about retargeting ads are always going to be targeting people who are bottom of the funnel here which is why it makes sense to retarget Simply with the offer uh so it's like hey you saw one or two ads or three ads because we don't know what the audience selection for this ad is but I would make a guess that retargeting ads because um the audience that enters into the retargeting bucket basically the new people that see the new ads uh and watch past a certain point or click to the site are a much smaller subset and change frequently you actually keep the creative the same because the bucket of eyeballs changes whereas when you're hitting a mass Market on a regular basis everyone's seeing the ad so you actually have to have far more creative top of funnel than you do bottom of funnel so if we just look at this this is an offer recap essentially so it starts with the price tells you what the what the dream outcome is if we're looking at our original framework we're reversing risk right so we're just hitting through these through the buckets of value uh it's cheap it's fast and it's guaranteed and this is a humor thing at the end there um and then again they'll restate the price all right so let's look uh further up the funnel because I think that'll be more fun and so it seems like they have two very uh different categories of ads which I think every business should do and if you're not doing this right now like do it I don't know I'd like do it but look at look at look at how Native these ads are right these are clearly iPhone these are clearly user generated content so ugc um and they're just displaying them as is so they they opted for a more basic look and so some big Brands would be like I don't want to show this type of content cuz it Doesn't reflect on my brand well um obviously they're going for the scrappy Underdog looking feel and the fact that they're a budget provider kind of makes sense that that they would use this Me by and large I tend to lean towards using ugc because it's like unlimited creative and you can just test it really easily and I've talked about how creating ugc Loops uh with an abysses can just give you endless ad creative but let's actually watch this ad from beginning to end here's my honest review of M Mobile's and limited all right stop so honest reviews if you look at search volume for any business reviews is almost always the second or third thing that comes up and so this is obviously something that people are going to want to know and so it makes a really strong hook and then the believability Factor here is I don't see any disclaimers on this ad uh and so it appears that this is not a paid actor this is actually just somebody who's a user who's giving a review and I'm going to bet it's a good one let's go and first off I don't have time to get my main for my book all right so I mean he's already framing whatever he's about to say as he's actually edifying himself believe it or not as you should trust my opinion uh for what I'm about to tell you because I am the type of person who likes cheap stuff all right they call to the boogo king second we're offering $15 a month for the first three months for the new C pause so they don't have disclaimers around uh who he is but they do have disclaimers around the offer itself which you can see at the bottom there so it's $45 up front all right so he said $15 a month but when you actually uh go to go to buy it it will probably be more which you can see there all right I paid $5 on I have't looked that there we go so he did say he does include the upfront fee okay that feels good I had to pay my phone three months it's been well so from an offer structure here he begins with 15 and then he says he paid $45 because he bought three months so they so from from a from an advertising perspective what they're doing is pulling cash flow forward so they can afford to acquire the customer and so if you pull the three months forward then they're going to give six months because it's a buy free buy three get free he said he's the BOGO King buy one get one right so they buy three so 15 time three that's 45 and then there's another three months afterwards so likely he's not going to get build for 6 months after paying $45 which is fairly comp offer all right the service the service hand be great it's wonderful call me be me if you want to reach me word again possible so what is the biggest concern someone has so there are these two pricing scientists called van West or it's one guy I think his last name is Van West anyways and so there are uh kind of four uh questions that you can ask when you're trying to figure out what to price something so the four questions are number one what is a price that's so high that you wouldn't even consider buying it the second question is the Other Extreme which is what is a price that's so cheap you wouldn't believe that it would work that it wouldn't actually function and then the two questions in between are what price is just high enough that you'd consider doing it you'd ultimately buy it but it would it would hurt or it would sting or it would be uh something you have to think about before making the purchase and then on the kind of like the from the upside is like at what price do you think this would just be a great deal all right and so what they're hitting on here is when the big fears that that a budget consumer is going to have which is okay it's $15 a month but am I going to get service is anyone even going to hear me like is am I always going to have one bar at all times like that would suck right and so he's hitting on the biggest fear that a customer is going to have so if you think about the value part of the ad he's saying less negative and more positive so you might be wondering less negative no more positive and so it's a very simple structure and you can also stack multiple of these in a row if you have a longer ad that you're trying to run all right let's hit the rest can made the source of mobile save some money and reinvest and so he actually makes the CTA at the end which is brilliant I mean that I mean it's very kind of him maybe they ran an ad contest uh for people to you know submit their ads maybe they didn't and this guy just liked making fun videos who knows maybe he's a great Creator we have no idea um but by and large though uh it's a fundamentally sound ad this guy gave a good hook he edified himself he said uh what he loved about it he gave the price uh and then he said what's your biggest fear it's less bad stuff more good stuff great benefits to you save some money invest call to action straightforward ad all right so now let's go back to Ryan R so you'll notice though they have far more ugc ads that are that are running and that's because ugc you just get so much more creative because it's it's it's leveraged right you can use the entire Community people all of your customers which I think a meta concept here that any business owner can take I I mean I am a massive advocate of this is try and build the advertising machine within the business itself that way you don't always have to generate 100% of your ads you only have to generate 20% or 10% of your ads on a regular basis and you let your community of customers generate the other 90 all right let's hit the next Ryan Reynolds hey it's Ryan Reynolds and this year our holiday commercial is just S 5 pick up for $5 for a yard sale oh good we're still doing this doing what well the holiday offer all the wir company stop doing errs in January so I want to make sure that we don't stop loving our customers just because December's over is future me micromanaging and am me just just got to be offer it's zero commercial now I am sufferable this is how you're using time travel you irresponsible son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so let's break this down uh frame by frame in terms of the ads so we go to the beginning boom he introduces himself hey it's and so I will bet that they have found that when he introduces himself uh that hook tends to work because everybody kind of knows who he is and so in some ways it's like it's it's not a true direct response cold uh Market open because no one who's really watching this and buying is cold traffic everyone kind of recognizes who Ryan Reynolds is and so they just reinforce that with all the brand trust that he brings to it which is fundamentally why he did the deal to do this to to to invest in this business and help grow it all right let's do it this year our holiday commercialist just St I picked up for $5 from a yard sale oh good you're still doing this pause so the $5 from the yard sale he doesn't even show any of it and it's just kind of this like random add in um and so this ad is primarily humor driven the Clone version is something that many many companies have used this angle and this is more of a behavior science thing but seeing two people who are ident pacle draws a lot of attention like think about twins of any kind I'm not going to get into anything else there we'll just leave it at that all right twins are inherently more interesting like you look back and forth you look back and forth and it's attention grabbing any people now if they wanted to make this even crazier this is the the the behavior side um if they actually had them acting in sync uh it would draw even more attention just from a from an advertising perspective but obviously there's a little bit of banter here all right let's do it what well the holiday offer all be called we stop doing errs in January so I wanted to make sure that we don't stop loving our customers so yet again they have their winning theme which is US versus them and they hate their customers and we love our customers and so they are continuing to run the ad also as a total side note um if the ad converted which I'm assuming it did uh they actually got a lot more runtime on it because of the excuse they're using for why they're going to continue to run this promotional offer now they've been more or less running the same offer this whole time and so inside of my offers book I talk about this so the last chapter in $100 million offers is the magic headline formula and so once you figure out what your offer is going to be you then basically bundle it over and over and over again and so same bundle different rapper and so during the Super Bowl I'm sure they'll call this their Super Bowl promotion during the holidays they'll call it the holiday promotion during the Spring they'll call it their Springtime promotion during the summer they'll call it their sumtime summertime and when it's fall they'll call it the back to school promotion and so you don't actually have to change the offer once the offer is winning you just change the wrapper around the offer to make the offer feel new and different when in reality it's still the highest converting offer you've got and uh I I talk about this a little bit more length uh in this chapter but I like to think about it as being like a fraternity party planner so back in my fraternity days uh you didn't really need to have a reason to have a party because you're in college and parties are what you do but you would invent a reason why so it's like John got his wisdom teeth pulled ker right and so you would just think about anything any reason why you can imagine and at the end of the day customers don't care what the reason is they about the offer but the reason itself creates novelty and I think if you are a small business I think this is one of the most underutilized advertising angles is think about ridiculous thing it's my dog's birthday and because of that I giving two months free to anybody who joins my gym whatever right it like I turned 37 7 weeks ago and as a result I'm running a sweek promotion like it doesn't matter but the ma the thing that does matter is the offer and they already tested that so once you nail the offer you just go endless variations and wrapping paper on it so now let's look into this and there's an interesting little tidbit here that I think anyone can take so they have a lot of ads from this particular Creator so this may be an influencer this may be somebody that they paid we'll see if they disclose that regardless you can see that there's a lot of ads from this Creator so I'm guessing that they did pretty well or that they paid her a decent amount of money to make a lot of ads now what I'm curious about is whether they kept the meat of the ad the same and just alternated the hooks or if they actually made entirely new ads so let's let's let's check it out he say if your grown up sign your own phone we your man is lesson two of these opies per montho all hands are $50 month three new so Haron advantage and all right so this is actually pretty good advertising um and I I'm going to I'm going to break down why so the Ryan Reynolds ads don't follow traditional direct response because they start with him just saying who he is because it's not really direct respon well it is direct response but it's going to the most aware audience but for many of us business owners people don't know who we are and so we have to start with something uh a little bit different so people might not know who she is and so we start with the call out right which is people noticing your ad is the most important part of the ad by a lot if we're thinking about this we need them to think oh this is for me that is the thought that you want someone to think or feel the moment they begin the ad because then that means that you have paid you've gotten them to pay attention all right so if I am a parent I might pay attention because I'd be thinking about my kids and if I'm a kid I might think about now if I'm sing person I might just ignore this that all together all right and we're is two ofice per month so this is why I said I think this is good advertising so if you're going to mass Market again this is a this is drawing an analogy or metaphor right and what's really clever about this is that they're just translating $15 into what the real cost is for somebody on an everyday um expense that most people just don't really consider a real price or real actual cost and so you'll see this in a lot of different companies and I do think it's really clever advertising um because I think it makes the price real for people and if you've noticed uh like sometimes insurance plans would be like for less than a dollar a day you can insure your loved one and so you can say it as the price so be like for her it's 15 so $15 a month they could say for less than 50 cents a day um obviously she just say two coffees a month but I would imagine like you could probably say for less than a pack of gum a week right you could you could do a different like that would be a hook that I would think would probably work just as well as the coffee I think coffee's been a little bit overdone because a lot of people do things in terms of coffee at the same time maybe people do that because it works so um I would probably alternate if this is me being the creative director I would alternate different props here um that would resonate potentially with different audiences there now if we're going for kids how many of them are buying expensive coffee I don't know what things are they buying that are in that price range I would probably look at that as some of the substitutes i' look at for the analogies or metaphors that I draw in uh to compare the price of My Thing versus The Thing and here's the key part that they're already spending money on all pans are $50 B for the first remas adue customers so St taking advantage of your par andage off so all we're doing all all they're doing here is just restating the offer so this is pretty straightforward and then they put a little joke at the end fine and so actually the last few words it ends soon is drawing upon urgency and so uh what's what's interesting about this is from a compliance perspective for advertising um the promotion could end soon I'm not sure how uh compant it is to have a promotion end soon and then the same offer Begin Again the next month for a different reason so I don't know if your holiday promo ends on the first and then on the second your spring promo starts but it's the same offer uh that seems great to me I personally don't care I think it's fine but in terms of uh legal people uh you can take it up with them um but the the the part that's key here is that if you can uh pull urgency which is one of the elements of an amazing offer right here page 112 um you want to say urgency is by X date or X time and so now they're saying and soon okay that's how they do it so soon is subjective and so soon soon could be for me 10 years from now that is how they uh they were able to have some little urgency around their CTA and probably have a compliant I'm glad we got through that together let's look at the next ad here uh and the key part that I want to look at is this is the same Creator so I want to see if they're doing similar hooks or they're just doing entirely different ads all together let's do it welcome to a conversation between me and a big Wireless sales you like to save money on your phone bill in the New Year I'm taking advantage of n Mobile's new customer offer right now for their unlimited plan you can 100% guarantee that if you go with us you'll save huge compar to your current plan how much you hang right now with mobile oh $15 a month they the largest IB Network in the nation and I offer you a similar plan at a much higher price just watching the last ad and this one what is now clear to me is that they're running viral organic formats and so the first one started with a PSA PSA grown to your own fan all right and so psa's I'm guessing um that format probably was a viral organic format and if this is a Creator which I'm assuming she is um I don't know her name is but I'm assuming she's a Creator I'm sure you guys can let me know in the comments um she now has another format that is a is a fairly common uh viral organic format uh somebody who's done a really good job of this is Erica Colberg she does like Financial stuff and she does a lot of conversations or pseudo conversations that happen between Representatives company and her she does legal stuff but like fundamentally exact same format and so that's the format but if we're looking at the theme guess what theme it is yet again US versus them right and so they have just found that from the Underdog perspective that theme works well why didn't no one tell me about mmob yal I'm honestly shocked that this isn't blowing up my be right now you can get mmob United pay for $15 a month three mon when as a new hust and I love about it is it's reliable affordable it's a news deal so it ends soon you want to pay less three your phone plan in 2025 don't wait in the mobile rather deal while you still hand I'll right here for you we basically just have a hook and then a ton of urgency all right now the thing is is that yet again she says it ends soon now reason why it was new year so that makes it a little bit more believable or compelling but at the end of the day they could run this New Year's plan for like six months who knows all right now the hook here is a pretty common hook for like reviews and things like that that happens in organic um I will say that for those of you who do consume organic shorts like this on a regular basis you probably have seen these and it almost this is me personally just saying this this is a pretty common structure for people who get paid to do an endorsement and they're like why has no one told me about so and so's protein powder it tastes so amazing I thought it was going to be right and then they go into it right um all right let's just go to the next one because you'll notice there actually let's let's just hit the number of times she hits UR in this cuz I think that's actually kind of interesting I'm honestly shocked that this isn't R right now you can get P for $15 a month for the first three months when you sign up as a new customer but I love about it is it's reliable affordable hereo it's a news deal so two also it ends want to pay less for your phone plan in 2025 don't wait mobile rather steal so she makes five urgency ctas in in basically last 15 seconds of the ad all right so um obviously this is direct response being the goal to get someone to respond immediately for the ad he is agan not M the sale put the date in your phone February that is when mob offer for $15 a month for the first three months of new customer in yes you could go the rest of the winter only paying $45 for a Pham pan without compromising on quality the savings here are insane commu to wireless so make sure you so let's let's I think this one's worth breaking down PSA do not miss the so that's the hook right so again she does the PSA thing and so the PSA is yet again a viral format something to consider if you are running ads is look at what organic formats are trending uh for creators and there are formats believe me there are formats and try and see if you can get your ads to mimic that format because then it will look more native uh and when you have like fundamentally the best advertisements are things that don't look like advertisements and like if if you this were think like this if this were just a Creator who were making this recommendation you'd be like wow it' be incredibly compelling and so the more it can look not like an ad uh then the better in general it'll convert all right so let's do the next thing I'll put up this date in your phone February is pause so they do actually have an end to this promotion and so now this is again a hard push on urgency but we've looked at a bunch of ads all of them have at the same price which is $15 um and so that obviously is the price point that they have seem convert and having the three Monon offer is what's working and an's offer of unlimited data for $50 a month for the first three months of new customer in pause so same restatement of offer she's just explaining what it is and if you are making an offer you just want to do it as as clearly as possible and you can see the disclaimer in the middle of the screen if you do have terms around payments like for them obviously it's they're paying it all upfront then that comes and there's obviously rate limiters in terms of how fast it is um but she tries to attenuate that big concern which obviously I'll bet you if they are uh good advertis ERS which they are they probably read the comments and the number one concern by the way big Pro tip here if you want to know the things that you need to include in your ads in terms of what concerns prospects have not customers but prospects have is actually just read the comments because people will tell you their objections for why they didn't sign up or why they what they don't like about your thing and then in your next batch of ads you can include those key points and overcome them all right you could go the rest of the winter only pain G pan without compromising on quality pause so two things here one is she just restates the offer in a different way so instead of $15 per month for three months she then just translates it again saying that means $45 until the end of the winter all right so it's just a different way of restating it which I think is worth doing because sometimes it just hits different for different audiences and sometimes it's like oh that actually I mean sometimes $15 a month for three months for some audiences will convert and for other audiences $15 or $45 until the end of the winter might be even more compelling I would say for me personally I think that is actually more compelling all right now the last part that you said is without compromising on quality now I think that in other ads they hit harder on the fact that the quality isn't compromised she just puts a little oneliner in there because it's the biggest concern anyone would have with a budget provider the here are insane big picture here um they're running a pretty clear direct response strategy um they're leveraging ugc uh which every business can should have if you have a brand spokesman then introducing them obviously in this Ryden Reynold scenario he continues to do it so I'm guessing that it works um I would be curious to test I haven't seen it I'd be curious to test what a cold or harder hook uh would do with Ryan Reynolds as the person in the ad like that would probably be one of the first things I would test if I were testing offers I would look at by one get two or by two get four um and see how that converted uh alternatively by three and three is fine nothing wrong with it but I would those are things that I would test the hell out of um I'm I'm assuming that sometimes you can break it back from what number converts so $45 may be the number and then it's just like how many ways can we mix and match uh $45 right what's that you guys want to see where all of this traffic is pushing fine we'll also look at the landing page let's do it okay so this is mobile.com which is their CTA uh in every ad all right and I do think big picture um if you have all your traffic pushing to one page um then you want to make sure that it's all congruent and actually it's a huge mistake I think a lot of marketers make is that you have all these different creative Hooks and stuff but then like you don't actually go for congruence and one of the easiest ways to drop conversion is have someone click somewhere and then not get what they think they're getting and so a lot of the elements here are look okay let's just look at this page here all right so right on the top time is literally ticking so they're showing true urgency um right at the top big banner um saying like you need to act now now on top of that they have a banner across the top that is probably also something that moves forward in the funnel and uh if you look at acquisition. comom for example we have a banner across the top because it's actually one of the most clicked buttons and so you can have the same CTA with multiple buttons on the page and in general rule of thumb not forever but if you only have one CTA on a site if you add another you will increase conversions if you add a third you'll also probably increase conversions at a certain point you have too many referees on the field and no no one can see the actual offer but in the beginning two three sometimes ctas in terms of button for someone to take action will usually increase the conversion of the page all right now we're hitting they're basically just slamming you over the head with urgency now they don't have scarcity because it's unlimited customers so that's not where they're hitting they're just going on time here so big picture for those you don't know scarcity is uh uh limiting quantity urgency is limiting time and so people talk about scarcity and urgency interchangeably and that's not how it actually works all right there separate things that can be combined but they exist separately all right now they do have a caveat it's new customers all right so it's not all customers but new customers get 3 months of unlimited premium Wireless for $15 a month all right so let's I mean it's pretty clear what they want us to do here let's scroll down let's go all the way down is there anything else there okay so two plant for the price of one so if you switch from one of their primary competitors uh they have a separate offer for you there all right now let's look at the secret sauce I'll bet you this is optimized for mobile too all right so 5G for free we're online flexible payment plans okay uh bring your own everything fine so what's really interesting about that b bye um another budget provider which you may have heard of which is Spirit Airlines uh has the same thing they call it your ass and gas so they say like we give you nothing and they kind of lean into how cheap they are and they are the cheapest provider but they do nickel and dime people so let's scroll back up and let's actually let's go like we're going to convert so why would they have so because this is this is this is actually like Dev work that they'd have to put in so there's probably a reason they added this bar in I would imagine the number one concern which they also talk about in their ads is what's the service quality right and so someone's like I'll switch to it if there's really good coverage in my area and so they're probably resolving one of the biggest concerns so let's just do acquisition. comom zip so yep there we go all right so there we go so they tell us that our device is compatible and they have excellent coverage now I'm going to be real with you um my question would be is like what's excellent now they do have a map so they can visualize it okay so they've got some towers that looks like it's right there at the corner but all right if I'm trying to make a decision I might say well they said it's excellent so I guess I'm going to consider so now we go view plans so let's do that okay so this was actually leads us to the same place as the original button so if someone takes a detour and then goes there pretty it basically you handle the objection and then they go back to the sale all right so choose your plan all right so let's see what we got here we got 3 months 6 months 12 months they obviously want um you know they're drawing attention to the 3-month offer and so what's interesting is that they have the same starting fee but just different ongoing fees after the fact to me the six-month offer is a dummy offer and I'll bet you they have their their split between the three and the 12 and so like look at look at why they would do this so it's like okay well I can only commit to three months and then it's $30 a month or I can pay $35 a month uh with 210 up front I'm like I don't know like for me if I look at this I'm either 3 or 12 and so when you have three tiers by the way you almost never want the three tiers to be evenly split so we're going a little bit into pricing but YOLO we can do what we want it's our video so so where you move the middle on a three tier offer determines where you want to nudge the customer okay so if I want more people to take my uh 12mth offer I will make my six-month offer really close to the 12-month offer and so I'm like oh well well shoot this is so close I'll just I'll just do that one right so this is the typical small medium large soda play that movie theaters has done for ages right so let's say that you've got equal ounce differences between uh between sodas okay so let's say that this is 10 ounces this is 15 oz and this is 20 ounces okay so that's what that's what these sodas are obviously at a movie theater it' be like a gazillion ounces and they just give you a gallon of whatever soda you want all right here here you're asking someone to make a logical decision and it's proportional to how much they buy and they're not really saving anything by buying more so functionally this would incentivize people to go here because there's no savings for buying more and if you wanted to just get some more later you take on less Risk by buying a smaller purchase and you could always just double up again later if you so desired now what does this next pricing tier tell you so let's say we keep our $5 and then we have $6 here and then we've got $10 here what does this tell you that tells you here that this is the best value option the first is here now let's look at a different pricing scheme so if we have $5 uh on the low option but let's say that now we've got $9 on this option and $10 what is the pricing CH that we're pushing towards we're like well dude for an extra dollar I'm getting another 5 ounces this is not a bad gig now because of this uh basically dichotomy between the 10 and the 20 um we would probably realistically what this would probably be priced at like if we were in the movie theaters this would probably be eight bucks this would probably be seven and so this would then push more people to hear right and so how you pric your three options you can tell what offer A smart business owner is trying to incentivize you to take so it depends so we're getting into a little bit of advanced pricing but you're an advanced person so let's talk about it all right so if I have this $6 option what does it really communicate well you think like for a dollar more I'm going to get 50% more soda that's a pretty good deal for here for a dollar more I get another 5 ounces of soda and so these prices are always taken in in aggregate right now if I have a lot of people coming in the door and everyone's buying Smalls and I want them to upgrade then I'm going to put my price here if everyone's cominging in and they're getting mediums and I want to push them the larges then I'm going to move my price of mediums up to make the large more appealing so what you're ultimately trying to do is maximize Revenue per soda buyer right and so it'll depend where your average customer is actually entering the business to determine which of these you would actually push uh so this is a sales page all right and so sales pages are different than landing pages so the first page was relatively short just wanted to get people to take the next step and they have probably tested pushing people straight to the sales page and it probably doesn't convert as high so they have that intermediary step to get more qualified uh people to the page why does that work no idea I can just tell you that often does work when you have too much traffic going and not enough conversion you add a step you add friction and then it sorts the right traffic all right so let's look at the actual page structure here so let's go to the top so boom big thing we have our urgency yet again and then we have our offer right there in bold so that everyone doesn't miss the thing last chance yet again 50% off cool okay they're restating the offer multiple times and then they restate the benefits underneath highp speed so if you're looking at this you've got headline subhead and then three bullets which is a really common structure that I talk about um and it's interesting because above the fold which is when someone loads on their phone you'll see a very common uh structure in the paid ad section 147 I talk about three different landing page structures that work really well and so what they have here is they're using layout three above the top all right so they've got headline subhead right so unlimited premium is headline subhead is last chance and then the three bullets right here now they have I have mine below below the button they have theirs above minor difference but fundamentally they're using this structure now notice I have attention Avatar at the top what do you think that is that's time is literally ticking and it says new customer offer so Avatar is right there attention new customers all right like these are Timeless advertising principles because they work this is how this is how you convert traffic all right so we've got the button I one tiny tweak I would consider on this page is I think the button is not visible enough and so I would consider making that more uh I would make it jump out more uh because I think you could easily miss that all right so let's scroll down it says choose your PL now it's telling you what to do okay great so now um this is just all plans include this are you new great and then just restates the offer yet again all right um and then we see our our three six and 12 month plan now they made it uh userfriendly for mobile so that you can you know toggle between them uh which I think really interestingly so imagine the user experience here so if I'm looking at this I'm going see $15 a month and I go to six six months up it goes up and then I go to 12 months $15 a month huh what is that telling me to do well I came for the three but man this one for 12 isn't bad and so what's interesting about this is that the intro offer is is 15 a month and then it bumps up right but the 12-month offer is 15 a month and then it stays 15 a month and so if someone has a sensitivity to that price point then they basically make it available to them it's like hey if you want to stay at 15 a month you can you just got to make the commitment right all right so let's let's scroll down a little more all right did you know once three months are up your new customer offer you can renew yeah so they're saying hey if you can't so this is a if you can't decide right now don't worry you can change it later which is a great re risk reversal all right so facts so now they're getting into features here and they're probably going to show speed because what's the biggest concern everyone has coverage and speed all right so they're going through these things and for us we already checked our ZIP code beforehand which they helped observe now I don't think anyone's going to know anything about this like like I honestly and maybe this is a compliance thing that they have to show which is very possible um so that one I don't know it might be a legal thing all right let's scroll down cuz obviously this is not going to convert anyone okay bring your family so this is an upsell potential so it's like okay not while I've got you cuz what's another concern someone has well I don't want to switch on my own I want to bring my whole family over because I don't want to be a separate plan than them cool so they gave a family plan all right now yet again we scroll down to the bottom and if you missed it because let's say you think about click Journey right so someone clicks over and they didn't they just went straight to the offer now that they're actually in consideration so they're thinking am I going to am I going to take this offer am I going to take my credit card out they might now this the coverage device Checker is what I consider a buying question and so sometimes on a sales call this is obviously doing this in in a virtual setting but there are questions that are like there are questions that are kind of more open-ended like Discovery questions that a that a customer would ask and if someone says like talk to me about payment plans right that's a buying question they're strongly in consideration and so this is something to help overcome any obstacles around purchasing so they were like okay the price makes sense if you have it in my area um I I'll attend your your gym how far away are you from me right that's going to be a real consider like and if you're close enough they have some line in their mind that if it's over it it's acceptable and they'll make the they'll make the purchase all right so scroll down and this last section is super common um on a sales page which is FAQs all right so almost always having an FAQ on a sales page will increase conversion because just think about every one of these questions as a couple percentage points of customers that haven't gotten all their questions resolved yet and either want a deeper explanation for some of the sentences or headlines from above or they have some unresolved concerns that didn't really make sense to weave into the page because it would overall lose some people and so you basically stack those at the bottom and you've probably seen this on a lot of pages even if you look at like an Amazon uh purchase page they're going to have their FAQs at the bottom where the the seller will answer some of the questions that people are asking all right and so if you by the way if you want a really great way to study like how to make sales Pages study Amazon think about about how they structure their pages and how many elements of persuasion are woven in that are real and actual now they obviously you know they're a trillion dollar company and so they have a lot of resources at their disposal but you can still use the elements of persuasion that they have right and fundamentally that's what they're harnessing here and at the very bottom I see this as a um if you haven't decided to buy yet why don't you enter our long-term nurture sequence where we'll send you emails to hopefully get you to buy later right and so that's basically what we're doing here so so so what's that you you want to see the emails that they send to convert more customers fine we'll look into them okay so uh Big Picture This is their actual email sequence so we looked it up you'll notice that these are very visual so these are very um picture driven so I want to make a clear Point here it's I would say it's very split in the types of products that are being sold what types of emails convert and so I've seen this is just me Alex's point of view um pictures do really well with physical products and low ticket items uh so people just like click and buy right if you sell services or complex services or complex products or high ticket products often times basically almost the exact opposite uh perspective this which is lots of text um that's plain text maybe one hyperlink that's all not formatted to basically make it look like a real email that someone might send to you that tends to be the best deliverability which will ultimately convert more people for those more complex things so if you sell services that are complex I would lean towards that here if you're e-commerce which fundamentally this is e-commerce it's just a phone service that you're getting um it makes sense now one last Point here is that notice that they don't offer phones remember the booe so they're able to sell at a much lower price point because most of the other carriers include the phone in some sort of payment plan with your service and so a big portion of what you're paying for is the th000 smartphone that you're you know sub that they're subsid ing for you over X period of months with a decent uh markup all right so let's look at the offers they have so email one is they just say they just restate the offer cool let's go to the next one all right uh now they say it's easy so let's think about the elements of value here right so first they restate the offer then they say by the way it's easy now the makings of mitt mobile so now they're saying okay someone didn't take the first two so now let's just give them a little bit more information right let's talk more about the value that they're getting that's the next email yeah and so here they're also telling a little bit of the of the of the story of the founder or or at least the spokesperson and so this would be more common if someone hasn't made the purchase for you uh purchase with you yet you're explaining more about yourself basically trying to build some trust build rapport with Prospect all right let's go to the next one all right so now they're hitting the family people and they're like maybe you didn't buy because of this reason you might have missed it on the site and so what they're really doing is they're chunking down a lot and just focusing on one obstacle at a time which is what I would encourage you to do in email followup is there's going to be let's say 13 reasons people aren't going to buy and instead of saying here's 13 Reasons let's handle them all you just hit one email at a time that hits each reason in order of prevalence meaning the more common the concern is the earlier on in the email sequence it should be all right now uh here's the 411 on Sim so this is like this is going to be a concerned question this is a detailed question where someone's like we do what about uh SIM cards what what about my use case I'm a special snowflake so they're covering the special snowflake scenarios um in this and I would imagine they continue down this process now if I had to rate this email followup um I would probably rate it like I'm being real probably a five out of 10 um main reason here is uh you know they're just hitting basic they're just restating the offer and over and over again um I think that what could make this better is if they made it feel a little bit more tailored right and so if they could expand in personalization now I don't know what segmentation they have in the background but personalization their marketing and um thinking about onboarding a customer before they're a customer um is a great way to take people get get people to do those first steps like that coverage question that they have it's like can I get someone to take a micr step towards me right and so I'd be thinking what other things are kind of micr steps that get someone who who Who's going to get further along the the road of consideration before they make a purchase another one would be like okay can we give can we deliver them some sort of lead magnet so once we have their zip it's it's like here's other people in your area who have said that this is really good that would probably be really compelling another type of testimony I might might read um someone who's like you another one might be someone who considered buying at the same time as you and is now already enjoying the benefits right and so people thinking cohorts so it's like if I considered buying this last week and it shows someone else who did buy last week and is enjoying the benefits it becomes more compelling because you you double down on likeness that person's just like me all right um uh additionally you can reference my my Rihanna video on some of the things they did for their offer but in this offer having birthday and anniversary offers is just it's wonderful reason why to extend personalized offers to people that will increase their specific urgency but the thing is is that you know that every month you've got one 12th of people who returning a certain age and so you've got basically one sixth because you've hit anniversaries and birthdays every single month that are getting a special offer and so if you do that on a regular basis it's like every month you get this kind of lift to one sixth of your audience that's getting a special offer specific to them all right and so um here are a couple actionable takeaways that I think you can take away from their site to convert more out traffic so number one is website optimization so if you haven't tested your page load speed um just do it and then most tools will tell you some of the things that images that need to be compressed um so that you can decrease file size and ultimately load faster now this may not sound interesting but for every 1 second saved you get I think I think Neil Patel had this uh he he's already studied this one but I think it's something in the neighborhood of like a 2 and a half or something like that perc increase in conversion per second and so sometimes I've seen some of your pages you have 9 seconds 13 seconds of load time it's like if you can get that down to like 3 seconds You've Got 2 plus per time 10 uh in terms of improvement on uh conversion right if you click and it's like changing a channel on a television you're going to convert more people now um the next one is using side by-side comparisons I'm surprised that they aren't really hitting on this heavily so they talk about it really heavily in their advertising but they're not showing um what other people are doing comparatively and so this is one where like Progressive kind of pioneered this in the insurance industry where they were showing what other uh plans cover and prices Associated and I think if you are the underdog then it's okay to do that if you're the top dog you don't show anybody else's but if you're M if you're if you're making a budget as your primary sales point then using side by side makes sense because they can see the Delta one of the other things here that I think is probably worth mentioning is hidden fees one of the one of the big concerns with budget providers like budget Airlines is that they will charge you for each piece of luggage they'll charge you for drinks they'll charge you for everything it's like are they going to charge me for anything else and I think being explicit about that somewhere would probably increase conversion so if I'm them I would be looking at the same plus good stuff away from bad stuff and if you you don't work with us so selling the don't you're going to keep having bad stuff and keep not having good stuff and that's where having the justos of the other providers could prove for very good fodder for ongoing emails and so like one email would just be more good stuff next email would be less bad stuff next email would be uh if you don't do this you'll keep having bad stuff if you don't do this you'll keep not having good stuff and then each of the good stuff and bad stuff you have three vectors that you can look at across all four of those which is risk speed and ease and so showing the visual of the step-by-step process of what it takes to sign up that could de it could drisk someone's concern about how easy it is from a speed perspective I would probably hit on more points of like well how quickly can I get act activated right like could I be using my phone within a few minutes if I could I would want to know that so I would talk about speed um from a risk perspective they do they are um they do have commitments Associated and so I'd want to know what are my cancellation policies and what does cancelling look like so believe it or not if you actually just show someone how to cancel before they buy sometimes they're just more likely to buy because they're like oh I understand how I can get out of this it reverses the risk of the purchase now the big obvious one is that price is another thing that they do but I wouldn't say that's an area of opportunity I think they already hit their price pretty hard if you like these types of real business breakdowns I had a small business owner who is a stylist who flew out to Vegas to have her business broken down and improved it's the video of the year that I got the highest amount of Praise from business owners 4 who said this was the best video they had had and so I want everyone to watch it because it's really good so go check it out
