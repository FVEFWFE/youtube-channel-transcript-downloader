the one thing that limits every business is the entrepreneur not the opportunity not the business vehicle not anything else it's the entrepreneur everything stems from them it's there's three things you've got the skills of the entrepreneur the character traits of the entrepreneur and then you have what I would call the beliefs of the entrepreneur is what do they believe about the world to be true and what do they believe about the world to be true that isn't we have so many of these belief statements that like quote Society or things that we inherit but we just choose to say that this is how life is the easiest way to think about this is an analogy which is if you imagine a ladder right which you've got the ladder of success skill on one side beliefs on the other side then you've got character traits in the middle as the rungs you might have a tremendous amount of skills and great character but your beliefs are limited if all of a sudden you see somebody have an overnight success it's usually because they had two of the three already very very high level but they were missing some huge part some belief was wrong so for example for me when I went from 2 million to 7 to just under 30 in a matter of like 3 years I believe things that were true of the world that weren't and I didn't know that licensing was a model I didn't know I could expand in that way and in so doing I was able to explode because I got into the right vehicle the vehicle wasn't limiter it was me and my beliefs about it and then as soon as I changed the way I saw the world I was able to get into a much better vehicle and explode from there the skills we learn through education education comes from repeatedly doing things and learning from that experience the information that we acquire to learn things comes in a lot of different forms now the things that I actually invested in workshops books seminars coaching programs one1 tutors oneone mentorships and Google Google and I would say if I had to allocate uh amount of time spent learning things Google was still by far the biggest one it's funny the other day I just set up this new widget for our site I Googled it and I did it in two hours and so I think that the amount of time that elapses between wanting to figure something out and doing something the more advanced you get shortens I remember it took me 3 years to figure out how to build a landing page and the day I decided to do it it took me 4 hours so took me 3 years and then 4 hours to actually figure it out because I was avoiding the feeling of sucking and so if you can confront sucking fast and just get over that idea that sucking is a bad thing then I think you compress the time between you and the skills you want the highest value I've gotten from is from one-onone mentorship is from people who are far ahead of me that were willing to speak strategically into my life and that's usually because those people can identify all three of those things they can identify skill deficiencies they can identify character trait deficiencies and they can identify things that you believe that are true that aren't so that is where I've gotten the most leverage in my life is on and I've paid 20 $30,000 an hour to many many different people just to have them speak into my life right underneath of that as I was coming up was joining masterminds it was the getting around other people because for me it was very lonely and so just being around other people doing things it a got my competitive drive up because I always wanted to be the best and seeing people that I didn't think were like better than me do something better than me gave me hope that I too could do it I'd see somebody be like I don't think they were harder than me I don't think they've got like some genius brain if they can do it I can do it too also when I was in those communities they would also already have sifted through information for me because there's lots of information out there the problem is that we have limited time so it's no longer about oh information's free you can find anywhere it's not free it costs time to go find where it is and so the idea is when you pay someone for information it's not you're paying for the info you're paying for the time took them to sort through it to hand it for you so you're cutting time that's what you're saving when you exchange the money that's the idea and I think a lot of people don't get that this is the actual order that I bought things so the first thing that I did I did free interviews so I tried to reach out to people so I just said hey I'll show you the stuff that I've got you want to share notes with me I can drive out there we can meet up and that's how I learned a lot of my initial stuff usually was older guys who were willing to like you know take a young young buck under their under their wing if you're young the advantage you have is that you're young you can get a little bit of that Goodwill from older guys that you might not normally get if they're the same age people were like well the millionaire won't let me pick his brain he like well no his time's more valuable than yours either pay them or you have to go down a run you have to keep going down until there's somebody that's either a peer or just slightly ahead of you who you can provide value to in a very narrow way the next one I did is I I joined a mastermind that was $10,000 and that was Sam backyard's Mastermind rest in peace and he actually took enough of a liking to me that he said why don't you just become my apprentice and then he started paying me so it's kind of weird so I paid him and then he paid me back so I work from 4:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day with him basically as his secretary and I learned a ton 3 months just like learning all these new terms sales copyrighting affiliate marketing I learned all the stuff just from him cuz he was in that world from there I started my first gym and I stayed in that gym Mastermind during the time I also bought a weekend workshop for uh Facebook ads I learned Facebook ads in a small group of 10 people in two days it was really valuable for me then I didn't really do anything for a couple years and then I went to traffic and conversion Summit so that was an event and I just learned more about Marketing in general I got introduced to different softwares that I then started using and then from there I kind of got more into the digital marketing world so I joined some master Minds in that world I didn't do coaching programs myself I actually ended up buying them for teammates I think the coaching programs are really effective to teach methods so if there's a method of acquisition you want to learn whether it's like YouTube ads or Twitter ads or cold calling whatever it is joining a coaching program by other people trying to learn the same thing from some who's good is a great way to fast trck your success it just gives you the accountability it helps you resolve problems faster what you're buying is speed it's not that you can't do it on your own it's that you can do it faster with help if you're trying to solve a specific problem finding specific coaching programs is really good if you've been stuck for a long time I think that's where like masterminds and one-on-one mentorship is more valuable because you probably have a strategic issue more than a tactical problem now the beliefs kind of get solved concurrently when you're in communities because the best way to break a belief is to see someone doing what you thought was not real and then have it happen a lot of people have heard of the Roger banister story first man to break a 4minute mile and then the next year 28 people or whatever it was broke the 4-minute mile and so the nice thing is that when you join these communities the biggest benefit is not even the coaching it's the beliefs that are broken and the things that you thought were false about the world that aren't and I remember there was a moment where I was in a mastermind and there was a guy making I think $350,000 a month and he got up there and he sounded like an idiot and L and I looked at each other afterwards we're like if he can do it we can do it that was when we weren't even doing that much money we were probably doing I don't know 20 $30,000 a month like it was not a lot of money so when I joined one of the first masterminds I wanted to get my money's worth I wanted to get as much out of this as I possibly could remember be everyone's number one student I talked to every single person in the M I set up a call with everybody and I was like hey I'm new I'm good at sales that was my first skill that I had I didn't have any I didn't know Market I didn't know ads I didn't know webinars I didn't know Ling I didn't know any of that stuff but I was like I know how to sell what I did was I just offered every single person to go over their sales script edit it the way that I would structure it and then rewrite them a sales script my way for free and I did that with everyone and then what happened is I had all these big stack of IUS and then I was like I want to get into internet marketing and I was like Johnny was good at landing pages hey Johnny remember I have to do that sales thing do you think you could help me with landing pages sure man of course okay what else do I need I don't know how to run ads hey Sarah you were really good at running ads remember that sales thing I helped you sure of course and I get one tutoring from everybody on the things that they're best at because I just gave everyone what I was best at that's how I did it you want to become the most valuable person in your network and then in so doing you gain access to everyone's Network like Joe Rogan doesn't need to network he just is Joe Rogan and so if he wants access to somebody he gets access to them because he is valuable I've never been a fan of like the networking hacks it just provide value to people for nothing and then you will have people who who owe you stuff you've got your skills you got your beliefs and then you've got your character traits if there's one that is the most important I do think it's character traits because the character traits are the Wellspring that the other things are are are founded upon if you don't have discipline you'll never be able to actually study anything consistently to gain the skill if you don't have focus and you're always building a new bridge every week about the new business that you're going to do it doesn't matter how many skills you have and the beliefs you have about the world Zuckerberg couldn't start 17 Facebooks you could only start one and you have to stick with it and so that takes Focus this is a really important point if you have a trait and this is where it's helpful to have communities of other people and ideally mentors Etc who can speak in your life and there's not even that many mentors who have the social awareness to say I don't think you have integrity I don't think you have Focus I don't think you have discipline I don't think you have work ethics I don't think you have Drive I don't think you have empathy I don't think you have patience like these are virtues these are character traits that people want to embody and so you're like how do you develop these traits you don't develop a character trait you act in accordance to what someone with that character trait would do and you do it despite being uncomfortable doing it so I'll give you an example I was walking the other day with Lila I was like God I'm so impatient I was labeling myself as impatient and i' I've probably that's been something I've believed my whole life I was like yeah I'm impatient I'm an impatient person I'm go go go go go but I also want to be a more patient person I want to be wiser I want to be more long-term thinking and she said you're not impatient and I was like what do you mean I was like all I want is for all this stuff to go faster and she's like yeah but you're not changing direction all your actions are one of somebody who is patient so the fact that you're uncomfortable being patient does not mean you are impatient it means you're just patient and so your internal feelings about what you're doing have nothing to do with the trait and so you think about the reverse of that where someone's like I'm super disciplined except they don't do anything that's disciplined you're like no you're not they're like no but I feel good like yeah but you're not disciplined you have no evidence to support that you were disciplined the idea of building a character trait is not do I have the character trait or do I not have the character trait it's to what extent do I have the trait and so if you can think about character traits that way then you can start reverse engineering the character traits that you lack and this is really hard because one of the things that I see with entrepreneurs all the time is it will happen is that they will feel bad about something and then they will want to change something in their business to make themselves feel better they take those emotions and then they try and feel better by erratic Behavior that's non-directional and then they break their original strategy the more willing you are to endure discomfort for an extended period of time based on a decision that you made in the past because you know it's better for your future means you are more patient character CHS even more than any of them are a pursuit of perfection that we will never attain but in understanding it that way you can see it as a journey of trying to stack up winds in your favor you do the thing and you do it so many times that at some point you look back and you realize you know what I do do this most of the time I guess I do own this trait and then you can label yourself as a patient man A wise man a kind man and I think in doing that you ultimately tap into the W spring that allows you to grow um beyond your dreams
