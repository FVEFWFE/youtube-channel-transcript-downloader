================================================================================

I have zero desire to become famous for the sake of being famous like none there's actually just a lot of costs with that what I wanted was business owners and so we tested out actually the last 90 days lead so leading up to two weeks ago I made almost exclusively very wide content so it was like relationship stuff we made uh Fitness stuff like food you know food video we made um like you know advice to my younger self like things like that and so we got more overall views but in terms of throughput of from those views to high quality like applications into the business or just even Book Sales which I use as like kind of a a looser metric for quality of of eyeballs went way down and so we have completely like so one of the big shifts I'm doing is I'm basically making almost exclusively business content now so I mean like I have no marriage to anything like if relationship videos is what would generated the most business owners because there's this theory in the in the content world that like so there's there's two theories that I at least the data that we looked at just completely didn't agree with which was one is that shorts viewers become Longs viewers and I just haven't seen that like I hear it all the time but when I looked at it that just wasn't the case people who watch Longs want more Longs people want shorts watch more shorts caveat if you find me in shorts in one platform but you're a YouTube's long viewer then you might watch my YouTube Long View like uh content and so but it's like if you only watch YouTube shorts you're not going to become a Longs viewer you will just keep watching whatever you normally consume so people have consumption preferences by platform and so I kind of see them as they're like in separate tracks in terms of bringing people in for the CTA like the give to ask ratio right um as soon as you start running ads in my opinion everything becomes gives and then the ads do all the asking for you which will help you out as a content creator because then it's like I'm just trying to push as much value as I possibly can in shorts I do Zero ctas Store wories um I do think is appropriate for ctas I don't think it hurts your reach and so if you do like one one or two of those a week I don't think that's going to hurt anything um Longs I see as somewhat different in that it depends on the CTA and so if I was like like I see me providing free stuff as also gives and so me having a CTA for free stuff I don't see as a take from the audience and so the reason that I have the like the books for example that are free on the and free on my podcast and whatnot is so that it's it's like it's free you can have it if you want to and if there's alternative formats where they can do it like for a fee then that's because of their consumption preference but if you're broke then use use whatever and so the the tldr of this is that I think you can absolutely have ctas in content um that drive to stuff that's as long as it's relevant and how you integrate it I think it actually works fine so like my number one YouTube video across my whole channel has a 14-minute CTA at the end number one video what what what do you define as your CTA though because I think CTA some people have this perception that it's like go do this now click my link but what is what does a CTA mean for you so I say if you're a business owner who's trying to scale I've got books and courses that you can check out acquisition. comom if you're someone who's you know trying to start a business or get started I put all these resources together for you and you can start you know you can start on school and so I just do that so you just point them towards your free stuff not even just to buy yeah just for my organic now ads then turn around and just scoop so like by they're I mean all ads are ctas so like that's that's how I basically you you chunk up a level and then you think about the give ask ratio across everything people see and so ads now take up a percentage of what people are going to see in the marketplace and so I have to compensate for that ask with give does that make sense now the gives that I have I still have ctas for free stuff so they can still you know join Thea list and they still might buy books or whatever it is but that's that that's been the evolution of now that we run ads with school I was like okay I have to I have to compensate for that you've seen homos ads right you want to win $1,000 I'm giving it to you for free I want $1,000 that's how they scoop up right like you you've engaged with something of hosi so the ads follow yeah yeah so I see the purpose of organic as getting free free facial recognition and ideally like at the coldest edges of this it's how many people recognize my face that in and of itself is going to create higher ctrs higher conversion rates and at higher prices one level underneath of that is people who recognize my face and have gotten some sort of positive experience with the content that I had even if it was just one video they're like you know I did like that video that guy made cool like the next level is like they also know my name you know what I mean and then believe that is like oh I watch a lot of his stuff like all the time and I'm a regular viewer right so there's there's these Circles of awareness and so the purpose of content as I see it is like shorts absolutely have Roi just way more with ads than they do with like trying trying to take a short and then like provide value and have CTA really tough yeah yeah really really tough and so I don't even do it because I throw in you can't I don't even mention the community my in my shorts I'll just like talk about a relevant um subject in that's involved in the community then then I'll be like like a meals video I do a grocery Hall if you want recipes for these meals in like the last 3 seconds it's only 5% of the people who watch the video all the way through get to there but the conversion still pretty good I me personally just cuz like this how I think I put it in the in the description and I put as like first comment and I and I have it in profile and so I kind of see it as like if someone wants to take the next step they'll they'll immediately be able to do that and that way like I might get 10 times the views by not having three or four more seconds where people want to dip does that make sense so that's that's the trade that I make in terms of short content um in terms of what we do on Instagram we just do reals right now um for for the most part because they just get the most views in terms of new audience I do see like a picture on Instagram as like an email now so if you've ever seen it like you'll get way more likes and way more like and you'll almost like I at least for me I get like guaranteed reach but it goes to No One new and so it's like if you there's a picture of me or doing something whatever or Carousel I'll I I basically almost like Guarantee Way higher reach just within people who know who I am and so I think those are like you mark it with the reals and what the platform is saying like this is what we're going to show to new people right now but then I make you could make your kind of like ctas with the um with the images does that make sense so it's like nurturing through the like pictures more nurture your audience is that why you do your um your Tweet as reals like yeah yeah they bang too they're really good yeah they Crush yeah super high Lage one thing we've seen a lot of f success with on um organic CTA is like if you have to do if you can't run Fay outs but you also need CT to make money is instead of offering more like instead of here's this one recipe if you want more go to my school group offer custom so like I can make custom recipes based on your Macros because like if you're on organic there's an infinite amount of more content like they you just keep scrolling but to get custom they have to go through your thing and if you offer like one-on-one coaching or a group coaching or whatever like that's their option to get C to at school cuz you over more is overuse like everyone says you can get more really good so how do you give something custom to each member if you really want to scale like thousand plus members group calls small groups is good just split that Up Customs good how how close does your content need to actually be to the people that you're trying to find so if you're trying to find business owners and now you're going Broad and now you guys all talk about going like you're doing load of different things if you're just trying to find like I sto that's the point of me doing that 90-day test is I'm not doing that anymore yeah so if if now you you now you know what you know if you had to go back in time to find businesses only businesses to get them onto school to build a platform in school how would you do that you make business content and business adjacent content so I see like I see personal development as like one step below but still adjacent like Rel like productivity stuff I see is adjacent to business I see like time man well time management is kind of like productivity like things like that I see as both wide but still semi- relevant to the audience um but the idea that like I do a relationship video and then business owners also have relation like it's it's too many steps to get the right people because it's really just people who consume relationship stuff just want more relationship stuff which I have no desire to make the the thing is what I struggle with the most and obviously everyone here probably doesn't because you've gone through is like that that first kind of step to start when you like who am I who's this guy like why is he talking to me like so when you click on a profile that has zero followers and zero views like is it just the content that you're saying the words need to carry your profile that's the only thing that's going to build that trust with you and the client to get them over to fill out a form it's just evidence it's just so how would you use sorry how do you use someone that has business experience and background with results to then showcase that to get them that you use that in the profile to edify who you are doesn't come across the arant and like so there's I mean there's different like one of our Big Marketing laws my team can tell you is State the facts and tell the truth just like it's just like that's the big bold thing and underneath of that it's say what no one else can say and show what no one else can show from a marketing perspective and I do that in ads I do that in content it's like one time State the facts and tell the truth say what no one else can say show what no one else can show because there's always things that you have unique to your brand that only you can show a lot of people just don't show it and there's things that you can say that no one else is saying so your your unique your unique setting proposition no not even this is just for just just for proving who I am right so it's like even even when I had like like to your point like how's it like you see me now but like when I started in the gym space I was a very very small fish and there was like very established players who were like jimm Gus who were all older than me who all like were just older than me just put it that way right they're all way older and so I just had to overcompensate by just being so much better than they were in terms of the that I was putting out and I was like this is a model that everyone's teaching here's my model mine makes more money I was like it doesn't matter if he's been here forever I was like these gyms I'll compete these gyms I feel like the only thing that I've got I I I feel like this platform like just has this massive like opportunity for businesses agencies like what I've done for me but I feel like no one else is doing that so now I finally have something I feel like could bring to social media to Showcase to be look I did this for myself with no following you can too bring that P yeah I mean you put the proof so as far as I'm concerned the content serves the audience as the give if they're curious for more they will then click your profile which is what most people do if you see something new you click over like at least for me that's almost always what I'll do if I see something interesting and then the profile tell me in one snippet who this person is and why I should listen to them and then you have your your link or your DM or your you know whatever your CTA is that's in their profile and again you can put that as the first comment you can put it in the description like you have three different places you can put the CTA outside of the actual content itself that I think will carry the content a lot further in my opinion I think I think one thing as well that you mentioned where it's like say what no one else is saying I feel like that for me at first was something that was very overwhelming because like I'm talking about wellness and and eating healthy and fitness which is the most saturated information on the internet and so in my head I was like okay it's going to be kind of hard to not say what iOS is saying but how can I say it differently right and so I think with whatever you're doing is like you want to be able to explain things in the most digestible form imp possible um that that at least is something that's helped me a lot so I speed faster than normal just to like uh you know keep people engaged and stuff like that I'd really try and dump things down did you just find ways to like distinguish or like how did you you know create that separation between that saturation um so before I was making Finance content I had like this one day I just had an epiphany I was like dude like how can you turn people's heads like these like you need to like I mean unless you're like extremely professional know what you're talking about like you need to be able to turn people doesn't make them listen to you and then I was just's like dude I'm going to start speaking faster like really bringing the enthusiasm and passion and big shift is how to to how I I say this a lot but it people still don't do it like if you say like how to three ways to blah blah blah kind of sucks like everyone says it like the amount of people's profiles that I see that have like five followers that are like six neat tricks that just like no one gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right it's six ways I helped this person do something or six ways I because the thing is is like how is it unique well there's only one of you and you have the clients that you've worked with like my case study stuff are videos that I make I'm like no one else can make this content yeah I've noticed that too I noticed in in the school games it's like opinion pieces versus like a story about something that happened right like the worst thing I hate it when I see someone do a post and it's like how to be successful six things I look at their profile they've got one member in their group which is them yeah and they haven't even commented on anyone's stuff so I'm like shut up basically like in my mind um but then you see Evelyn for example say I over the last 30 days I spent this much money on a and here's what I found and she just lays out the facts that's the difference right it's state the facts and tell the truth cu no one's doing anything everyone's just talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on the internet so so if you don't have evidence so this is for everybody who's listening who's back home so the best version of this is like you know I I helped all these people just like you do this thing one degree below that is like I did this thing that you also want to do and you just are like me and so you want the same thing a version before that is I did this work that you're not willing to do and so I will show you the result of that work and so I could just as easily have a title for the YouTube video that I have for the the six big shifts that we're making our content as like I got eight million people across these platforms like over the last 3 years this what I learned if I didn't have the proof from the 8 million I could just say I made 35,000 posts this is what like I'd be like well [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I mean he probably learned something you know what I mean and so like that is the edification and so like the action creates the proof are the people at home that don't want to do the actual hard thing like they're not the expert they don't want to do the actual art thing you can make an observation of like how someone else did the heart thing and like back into their process and then it's even unbelievable because like ideally you're doing it about a big person who's like really successful and the metrics are easy to to prove and you're just like connecting the dots for the audience yeah when I started my channel I had no credibility so I talked about stoicism and what Marcus Rus said it's like no one cares what I say but people care what he said because he has The credibility super strong yeah with education content everyone wants a deal on time so if you think about fundamental what education is it's like I spent this time learning math and I'm going to teach it to you in less time than it took me to learn it and so people were like wow I don't want to do all those 10,000 problems show me the three-step way that you do it from this big thing you did and so I mean I think this how civilization moves forward is that like it takes us all this time to learn this thing we then distill it down someone starts one step further and then like that's how you put a brick in the wall and so like if we are quote Educators which almost everybody here is I think is anyone here an Entertainer no okay so if everybody here's an educator then all we want to demonstrate is huge Roi on time for them and so the more time you can show the more cost you can show so Evelyn did both she's like I spent all this time making these ads and I spent all this money doing it and it's like well wow I don't have to spend that time or that money and I can get the same lesson this is a good deal and then they they listen they buy and then they they follow her whatever that that was definitely one of my biggest takeaways in the last three years of making content in the beginning um cherry-picking facts and not wasting a damn second of anyone's time and just delivering the value as quick as possible is the only way is the fastest way to build that initial audience because once people know who you are then you can kind of fluff it up a little bit more because they going to listen unconsciously but I mean like you were saying before in the beginning that portfolio that Garden of content that you're building in the beginning it's just straight delivery cherry picking and in my theory is that you keep doing that and actually don't get fluffy well I yeah that's like this is what we saw in our stuff you can because you have a because you have an audience right and so the idea though is if I like if by percent I I grew the most when I treated everyone like they didn't know who I was and I had to earn every single second it's continu like the guy who dates his wife like it's at the first date on the on their 10 years keeps the wife right the one who keeps the audience is the one who treats them like they don't know who he is and he has to keep earning it every day and so like one of the six shifts that we have from the 35,000 pieces of content we put out is that we are no longer doing basically what I would consider branded content meaning the basically like Al Mo's diet Alex Mo's version of branding because if you don't know who I am who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and if the point of me making content is to get more people to find out about me then I have to not say who I am I have to say what I've done and then that becomes the reference point for the content just as something I mean do whatever you want but that's what I'm doing so first off I'll open up to you guys what's been working well for you right now um in terms of getting members of school off organic man chat what was it man chat many chat so running so you post and and then have a Min chat link and then yeah just have them comment and then a man chat will automatically BM them the link to join so comment CCA is this on Instagram yeah I've heard many people using this successfully Yeah we actually have a funnel buildout so instead of sending them straight to school cuz some people can't really articulate it they just see SCH so s to a funnel yeah it just warms them up you can send them like a lead magnet like something free for example I've made this free guide for you uh as well while they see the free value they at the bottom there'll be like the vsl there um the the sales that are there then like oh wow he really helped me so I'll I'll join the things so it warms them up for the school he maybe we should really cuz I know this works well maybe we should really flash this out it does really work so first of all you got to have an Instagram page with a following right and then you post you do a post what do you saying your what does this post look like so we do we do direct DM um CTA is like send us a key word you can also do a comment I haven't done the comment before but it's been the most effective strategy CU you can pre- automate voice messages and and then at the end bring in the virtual sales letter which is the offer so but what is the actual post so basically it's like it's like you giving free value at the start here's how to lose weight in three different ways and then you say the free value after that You' be like I've actually made a full guide if you want more on this so because you really giv them value you say DM me uh fat loss um many chat will see that and they will send that over to their DM so when something's sent over to DM it's more warm because it seems like we sent it so when you do that they're like wow this guy messaged me they'll click it and they'll consume the free guide uh allowing them to be more warm to get into your program so you use the call me and Trigger so we I do if if I'm on live and they comment certain way my live they'll get s a DM if they comment a certain word on my post even if they can spell it well oh so you get on the live too get a ton of I'll bet you get a ton during the live yeah during the live and then also if they send me a DM um they'll get it so one of the I just had one of my first posts that just went viral um I actually learned this from Jose where I'll start the post off with a hook so the first thing I said was um this is what I do if I had less than $100 in my name and I wanted to make 10 or $20,000 and so that right there just grabbed people's attention and then just throughout the post it was like maybe a one minute or less post I just gave a free like game on step by step do this that there made it real simple you want more information about this comment the word deals under this post and I'm going to DM you a link to my community and then they'll get set to our funnel we get their um phone number we get their email address we get their name so even if they don't sign for the school Community we have their contact information so now getting text messages or getting emails so we're just C some marketing to them so you lead capture and then it's a school on the thank you page like a school like redirects after you after they opt in exactly they'll opt in and then it'll take them to a second page and then they just it'll collect the payment and then that'll send it over to the school okay got it understood to add on to what Rashida said with the like Instagram lives and Tik Tok lives what you can do is you can automate the live as well so what we did to actually really get oursel in this position is to go live literally twice to three times a day and yeah and what we did was um we've give out profile reviews so we're basically help people grow their social media so we sent we told them comment down um in the live um guide and they will like get sent the school so we did profile like reviews so we're like holding their profile up and reviewing it giving them like personalized value and people would be like wow I want that and so if you want a full review hop over to my school we have group calls like this every single week imagine if I gave you this every single week right and speaking actually one-on-one with you and you can run that automation through through live as well I like that a lot so either a comment CTA which you can do on lives I feel I mean me just shooting from the hip here if you're live with a lot of people and you're saying comment this if you want it you're going to get a ton of comments right and then all of them get shot over to to Min chat and then they get either the lead magnet which was your method or for your method you just send them straight to the funnel to opt in and then go to the school Community after they collect you collect a payment the cool one about the comment is it probably boosts the reach of the post because as soon as they on it then it'll automatically have me send a comment comment under their post and check your BM and it's a lower friction thing than sending a DM I think yeah yeah have you tasted the comment one we haven't done the comment one yet that would be interesting yeah the follow-up comment's a nice little nugget too cuz then you get you get double the comment what's the follow-up comment I missed that so yeah go ahead it'll just little comment where it GS and then it'll leave a follow I saying I just sent you a DM or check a DM buy yeah like in like you can say like in five minutes like if they've seen it in like 10 minutes they'll follow up hey bro how'd you go with the link or hey bro how' you go with this yeah so then it like allows them to follow up yeah so check your DM comment you send the DM and then if they haven't responded yet 5 minutes later it's like hey did you like it or exactly exactly yeah yeah yeah and you just set like a a string like a t like a board and he just goes yeah it's it's quite seamless anyone else have any other strategies they did organic yeah go for yeah so me just pulling out my camera and just recording like just very non-edited raw content for so I don't understand it it's working very well to shorts a day um I used to do a long videos that's how like started and this is doing better and just posting those same reals on every single social media is it's just doing everything I don't know why I believe it I posted a raw uncut one the other day and it's done very very well I know yeah Raw and Uncut it's just fa anyways so the M way we grow are we just talking about social media cuz we do have another or the main way we grow our community is through free webinars yeah so we do weekly webinars every week you email your list say do you email your list how do you get people to the webinar yeah fre we'll send out emails send out text messages promote it on social media my business partner has a huge Vol way um so we'll do weekly webinars and then at the end of the webinar we offer them a bonus if they join our community so at the end of the webinar we're upselling into I 3 to 5 day boot camp usually those boot camps or a few hundred but now we're telling them if you buy a ticket to enter into our school Community you'll get you'll get a free ticket to the uh the boot camp and so that's the biggest way that we can grow on a community that's in the most successful so the bonus is the free ticket bonus for joining School joining school and then you get a free ticket to the 5-day boo camp and the 5-day boot camp is really sell upselling them to a high ticket mentorship but for those who aren't in position for the high ticket we can still keep them in the low ticket in the school and it we're just nurturing them so they ready for a high ticket so free virtual event which is the webinar and then from there join my school and if you do that you can attend this other event that normally you'd have to pay for but it's also free is that one virtual too yeah it's virtual so um the webinar is we're selling the boot camp okay so yeah we're selling the boot camp and then okay you get free access if you join a school community so you do the whole pitch of selling the boot camp and say you could pay for it or just join cost one of my favorite pitch strategies yeah so that's that's been success love that so did you already have that boot camp established before you launch your school we did but surprisingly a lot of people haven't really don't go about it the b c is valuable like we just give them so we pack so much information in those five days so that they don't want to miss that boot can we just make sure that we make sure yes a five so so do you pay for the like you pay for the like like the place where they stay or it's virtual it's a 5ay virtual boot camp oh gotta how's it how's it built out on your school is it just like a couple different sections of the modules saying boot camp part one boot camp part two or um we just put the link on the calendar we just have the in fo the Z links on the cabin so you have to be in the school Community to access the boot can also it's interaction in col or pay $10,000 which they and then everybody that's already in the school Community have access to every Bo Camp every month cuz again we shy it up sste of high tiet so you hold one five day boot camp every month three to five days yeah and so that's a huge part of the delivery from the school perspective is that they get do they only get one or they just get that free boot camp every time as long as they're in a community they can attend every how do you get 450 posts out in two days worth of effort like what's your process where's my guys work um a lot of work I mean is it like writing to like then shooting the big the biggest secret secret weapon that I have is Twitter or X whatever um that's actually like no one no one knows that but like everything is so I just I tweet all day long on X and then the stuff that does well we then use the crap out of so that then obviously gets me people on X I take that that turns into Instagram reals from there I will read the Instagram reals that I know perform into a camera and then those become clips that also Crush literally different format for the same thing and then I'll take 20 of those and string them together and make them a YouTube video and then when we caption all of the posts that we do we use other high performing tweets to caption the other tweets like my captions are just two tweets it's tweet one which is the real tweet two which is the caption is just another tweet cuz I so if you ever see anything written from acquisition. me I wrote it everything it's just all on my Twitter and so they'll search like friendship loyalty sales whatever and there's you know 50 tweets about it and they'll just grab one that goes you know as closest with the tweet that they made for the real and that becomes that so you just like get inspired twe yeah and then you just take the best one yeah I wouldn't even say inspired there's just like stuff happens and I'd be like don't do rev shares for Equity like don't do advice for it does not work unless you're doing minuscule amounts and even then people hate you that's super interesting she used Twitter as the smallest friction just proof of concept whatever tweets do the best you use those to create reels generate a question from that and then you bulk those for the bigger higher value YouTube videos and there's zero penalty for tweeting a lot the platform is BU for it so so what so if you had uh let's say you were to start your Twitter account from zero like how I start from zero yeah yeah yeah like uh let's say right now you basically had zero followers zero no one knows that your power towards your value towards scripting how would you start a Twitter account and would you even start a Twitter account if you already have Instagram 100% I it's literally the core of everything I do so yes I'm a so which so I'm a writer first people don't know this like the reason the books do well is like I write them like no one else writes I don't a ghost writer I write them that's why they're good um and so well I'll say this the reason they still sell two years later is cuz they're good like if I had had a ghost writer I could sell a million copies on one day because people will buy something that's associated with me but not necessarily they won't tell their friends about it and that's what I I want the long tail um so from uh if ICI had to start over from Twitter I would have two proof points that I try so one is going to be in the description which is like who I am what have I done now if you've done nothing then everything has to be around documenting stuff that you've that you're actively working on like the the person who's like here's how to like get yourself to be motivated it's like dude you have three or like I hate this it's like I help people grow their their Instagram followings and they have like 79 followers I'm like what are you doing you don't pass the first check of proof it's just OD like duh you have a Vegas sign that just says like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] description and then because of the way Twitter works you can pin one tweet and so that tweet what I would have is a long tweet that's like here's Who I Am by the way and then the tweets everything after that is going to be consumed within that context do you guys database your tweets in anyway for rafson or that just search you can sear I mean it's searchable already as is there's a Chrome extension called tweet Hunter yeah or there's Twitter Advanced SE do all that stuff I don't even use any I literally like I only have one thing that I use that just allows me to schedule tweets out cuz sometimes I'll think of like three or four and I'll just like o well I'm not going to do them in a row so I'll just space them out a couple hours that's how I do it and the clips where do you post the clips the like you said you do the reals and then you just re-shoot a clip so we do we do different so our content is different across YouTube shorts you don't need to do this we do this it's different on all platforms and so YouTube shorts Instagram short uh reals uh Tik Tok are the three short form platforms that we're on right now and so that's what we do and then we have a couple uh Longs per week to go out on YouTube uh I do podcasts as well which a lot of the audio from YouTube turns into podcasts um and yeah that's like that's the content system we just do like five or seven YouTube shorts a day I do I tweet like five to seven times a day we post just this is just my account we do two or three um Instagram reels a day I think we do like four Tik toks a day and then we have whatever one I'm missing that one has it too and then I have Leila so times two what's the why do you guys have a different strategy for what you post on Instagram or what you post on Tik Tok because Instagram penalizes you you can't it doesn't like if I post it 11 times we wouldn't get the same we we we I mean I'm happy to do volume um but no we saw two two to three was where we kind of max out that's what most people don't realize like you can't can't span Instagram cannot yeah it still functions more like a u like an email list still compared to like Twitter and Tik Tok which are Tik toks actually move more in the Instagram Direction but um where your stuff gets shown to followers even if it's not as good of content um but the original Tik Tok was like anyone could go viral because they just prioritized the quality of the content and and basically followers had zero influence on who saw your stuff and I think I think just based on what I'm saying it's it's shifting a little bit more towards like some like they will put your stuff towards some followers do you ever I mean I'm sure you do you AB test let's say one tweet does well um you shoot you say it one certain way for reals and then a different way for YouTube shorts or 100% we remix and repurpose as much as we can so same topic different different structure if we see if we see that a tweet really well that I know that that topic is interesting to people or at least that phrasing is interesting to people and so I'll say direct to camera it'll go into an email it'll be a caption on a different platform like we use the crap out of it like tweets are my my home base that's where that's that's the actual only direct content that I make everything else is Multiplied from there do you have a plan to repost the same exact content over a long enough time horizon or do you yeah like Greatest Hits Greatest Hits yeah I'm fine with Greatest Hits we actually think we do a bad job of doing it right now I would like something I was like hey we should you know maybe post this stuff again um but yeah that's that's actually something that we're working on but up to this point it's been almost entirely denovo yeah so recycling like your top 10% of content and then just sprinkling that back out even once or twice a week you're greatest hits from a year ago because you have new followers to them it's not it's new how how long in advance would you post that for example I made a piece of content that banged um depends on the platform so I can take something that was a tweet from 6 months ago and I could do it again today and it'll crush the same if I think I think basically the more like Instagram I think has the longest the longest memory and the least amount that you can post per day um like YouTube you just can't do it at all like you can't repost a video because the videos kind of live forever so like I guess YouTube would be the extreme on this on this side and then Twitter is probably the shortest shortest memory most forgiving um in terms of volume and reuse TI Tok kind I say Tik tok's like here yeah exactly so the amount of time that you that elapses between reusing the same thing I think it also depends on how fast you're growing I think your definition of repurposing is like like sometimes re-shooting as well right and not just reposting yeah so do you just have two or do you have more forms of reposting sorry repurposing those are the I mean crossplatform different format and then literally just redoing the same thing and just posting an old clip again it's like four different ways you can remix the same thing YouTube's content ID system was really really good because they check the copyright they've got those processes built out you can't repost like doesn't work how long did you go from just you independently doing your content before you brought in the whole team and stuff because I like my screen time is just outrageous like between shooting on for reals take talks YouTube shorts and long form YouTube I thought about adding Twitter last week but like at this point it's like I need to out how many how many hours do are you getting I'm curious like nine nine every day and I was in school so it was like all day it's just like stimulation and S yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no I uh I immed so if you've read the leads book I talk about agencies there's a chapter on agencies I that's the strategy I use so day one I had agencies for everything for Content creation and then I told them day one like my goal is to bring this in house over time and so I'm going to learn whatever I can and a lot of those guys like they don't know as much as I know now but they knew more than I did then and so I just learned what I could way faster and just like try I avoid like a lot of new new be mistakes and then I just make intermediary mistakes and just had to learn how to like not make those you know what I mean um but yeah a lot of for me though like Capital wasn't an issue and so it was just like I'm willing to pay to just almost like be accountable to making three YouTube videos a week or whatever it was yeah and then they would like trim them cut them put a pack you know put the the headline and the thumbnail on it which I hated half the time and I was just like whatever we'll deal with it later I know along that same line do you ever do you ever get tited like I mean like never I've been slept since the 90s it's so much Belling for so long consistent like do you ever feel like I think it's just as long as you talk about stuff that you like and so my team knows this and like there're some sometimes they're really good about it and I think setting that precedent with the team is like hey I need you to come with like 10 cool video ideas and like honestly half the time I'm like cool I don't want to do do any of those uh I want to talk about this cuz it's top of mind and so I I talk about the stuff that I want to talk about and I think so that also just kind of gives natural like kind of variety to the content in general because I'll be like really focused on LTV stuff for a while um and I'll be like you know what like I'll get into like there's a sales issue for one of the companies and like I'll just kind of like rewash myself into sales stuff and I get in sales mode and I talk about sales and all my content for a little bit and so I just kind of let that happen naturally rather than if you're like I have to do one thing on family I have to do one thing like I have we have never had content buckets ever if content buckets happen it's because they have occurred more than because we planned them um which you you had the observation point this total side note the amount of like Alex rosi breakdowns that are just completely false I find hilarious um I'm like oh is that my four pillars I don't do any of that um and so no it's way more I talk about stuff that I enjoy talking about and from a constant strategy perspective I had this roommate brilliant one of the two smartest people I've ever met in my life um and he had this he read this book and it was called too good to fail and I was like what's your marketing strategy he was like that he's like if I just make the stuff that I have so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good like if I just make it so that even if one person sees it they will share it then eventually I'll win and he now runs a $100 million do company and so like and we were roommates back then and so I I I very much have taken that perspective like if you're brand new you just need to make this stuff as good as humanely possible and the reality is that it will still suck but you still have to have that bar because you'll look at what you did two years ago be like oh my God that was dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right but just like holding nothing back like the reason I I talk about that a lot is because somebody who's new holding nothing back is still like barely valuable right and so like people still will consume the stuff see that you're really good and then still pay you for help they will like they will pay you for implementation so just give away the secrets it does not matter are you are you happy that you're as famous as you are now it's it has pros and cons honestly it has pros and cons what's what's one what's one biggest con and what's one biggest Pro biggest Pro is that we can recruit anyone from anywhere that's what I want but I don't want any attention privacy is the cost of Fame like it's a price um the con is privacy it just doesn't exist so like every single time I go out to eat with Ila I'll have three or four people interrupt us because it's the one time they're going to see me and they want to take a picture they want to tell me about their business and and like the first two times it's awesome you know and then like the 100th time it's like you know you still want to be really excited about it because the thing is is like I also don't want the reputation of like yeah I met him in person he's a dick and it's just cuz like it's my 10,000th of this and it's the first time and the last time this will ever happened for you and just trying to and so I think on some level it actually changes your behavior because if you basically realize that everyone is recording you at all times like mentally or literally recording you um you just you're like okay I just can't have bad days sorry do you guys get that because like you're obviously done there with like you guys are big but like do you get recognized interrupted [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stuff like that I choose to Little Alaska I mean for me it's just been I mean it's been 10 months since I started and it's definitely like it's like surreal at this point like now just like I'm in college so if I go to like I went to a college bar I was just like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] um walking around like yeah it's it's weird but I feel like it's that trade-off you have to kind of accept especially if you I mean in my head it's just like I want to continue to grow on social media and then leverage that to grow my business like I want to do that that's just yeah it was a choice I did it on purpose and like it took me a long time to get there cuz I was like I really don't know if I want to do this but it was a choice and the one thing about it is that it is like a tattoo is like having a kid it is irreversible which is why it took a really long time to like think about whether I wanted to do it or not so like if you have a skill and you don't really particularly care for it then I would say don't worry about it just go get the businesses the way you know how to get them and then just let them funnel the people into it and do the work that you know how to do okay so we covered I think we covered organic stuff let me see if there's any other um if you had to assign a value like a network to your social presence what's what valuation did you give that break it's probably worth about a billion dollars right now honestly like that's not me exaggerating that's um just from the amount like if I were to just quantify what we like the amount of media that we get and the conversion value of that media so like if if like if I had an elegant like the most elegant conversion system would be like we go public and I said hey do you guys want to invest in this I've taken this thing from here to 250 million a year I think a lot of my audience would be like yeah in and then that would immediately acquisition knom would be a multi-billion dollar company
