================================================================================

if you asked MJ would you rather PRI a mind or a seventh ring you'd say a seventh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ring talking about different objectives what is yours be rich [Music] possible trying to train some legs and I'm going to Mr Alex harosi gym a bunch of old broken men they need a lot of warmup what's up so we're doing legs what's the plan all right you want to just alternate like we'll go I'll go One Direction you go the other this thing deceptively heavy I'll do whatever you do you want to go yeah let's go what's the heaviest you had in the offseason you7 me the heaviest I've ever been I kind of stopped trying to push food right now and I'm going to slowly bring it down from here cuz I mean for you to keep winning it's like you don't need more size right I have a little room do you ever year like 2 lbs okay and I can always like be leaner and I keep putting on and I keep making weight so yeah we just keep it working Jesus I could have warned youall now it's a counterbalance for Russian lro okay come on deep breath use your breath come on keep going yep woo easy came out the top of there it's counterintuitive that once you succeed at bodybuilding everything comes with this success of bodybuilding prevents you from succeeding in bodybuilding yeah feel like speaking and guest posing yeah like traveling podcasts whatever and not wanting to wait till you retire to start a business and all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well I don't think you should no like starting a business when you when you retire is like no one cares anymore we definitely Force grow WE Post we do 450 posts a week how often do you film that every day no it used so we used to it's like it's changed over time before in the very beginning it was once every 90 days every one full day really and we do like a 100 clotes just that was it yeah and then it switched to every other week and then it became Fridays and then now I was like you know I think I'm better if I'm fresher and I do few or more yeah and so that's what or something like in the moment it's exactly what it is basically D message to me is like we're ready if you feel like stepping away at any time so I'm doing my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the morning if I like lightning strikes I go down and I talk wasn't as tough of mind I got to ask done any seminars in there was no one in the crowd and filmed it yeah yeah no I did cuz we why the team there but like had this Theory I do better live at live things than I do in front of the camera just more you know interesting and so I was like can I approximate that so then we did the whole setup we did the presentations the stage and then they s my teens out in the audience and I gave the presentation but it it's not the same you're not talking to empty chairs but there's still it still mostly empty chairs like teams can't fill a r yeah we opted out of doing that we did it like four times and then doing it yeah and so then I started doing Instagram lives and that was way more like fun yeah also cuz it's like the room's got 2,000 people in it or whatever you know so that's nice I mean if you can present in front of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] empty chair that's harder than a crowd so yeah right just the on light yeah I had this tweet that went kind of viral it's like if you're like 16 to 25 like just get in shape yeah like cuz once you're in shape you can stay in shape but like you have the time and you'll get different priorities later yeah so it's like just do it then you have all the F yeah I'm grateful that I I I was obsessed from 15 I start I was 14 until I stopped Compu 25 it was right around when I started my I was 23 but I guess I start I stopped Compu 23 when you're 23 yeah when it stopped got my state record I think not National fair enough there's 50 states I think 23 when I dropped no 22 is when I dropped at a university and that's when I started doing it full-time were you uh like a junior or senior side I there for four years but on my second year of school so you you lived but I was Jack you're that's all it matters which in your actual life that is all that matter exactly it paid off yeah what do you think you to do lift weights for a living you're like actually yes that sounds great yeah I literally would spend 4 hours in the weight room and then like be in the cafeteria all day right that life right yeah are you the only member of raw Athletic Club no this is our public gym oh is it we just opened it like 6 weeks ago it's a Tas Shore Warehouse where your private gym is no my private gyms away from there this is in Nashville Florida it's in Florida where our partners is in Nashville with carbon culture maybe that's what we oh no no car culture yeah yeah I worked out the gym yeah he do some of the formulation stuff he's actually our partner in the in the business he used to own the manufacturer and then we partnered with them and we got pricing and help on our payment plan and all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah cuz I knew he did that I remember I got connected his location operator when I went in knew who I was he was like you should talk to our owner and I was like I you know whatever he's like no he's you know blah blah so I was like fine so I think we had a phone call or something yeah yeah he's a really good guy he's SM yeah I know he sounded that way because I was when I was getting in the supplement business he quoted us uh for manufacturing oh yeah yeah he was one of the I think he's the final three bits we going another company but probably should have gone with him all right bulgarians yeah so we've got uh I've got this thing you got a proper pad I do have a proper pad fancy I usually set up next to this pole here just have them in the balance on use a dumbbell or um I yeah usually I just grab a dumbbell how do you do it yeah but I just never held on something oh well that's how you cheat that's how you do it exactly here I'm going to put a little bit of music on cuz we have a sound system he silence well that's kind of nice hearing you pant now I'm going to try it out see you're my inspiration sorry you're my inspiration good like what motivates you and I'll just be like this guy right here this assle comes in my gym and looks more than me yeah that's a motivation it is I used to really like uh barbes like they used to tear my glutes up more than anything back when I had glutes they're great walking leses are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] incredible for leg grow you can load them you're such a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to do like I left this whole Corridor empty for that yeah for walking away just cuz Lea doesn't cuz Lea's hardcore two play walking lunges yeah that's the biggest I did 225 225 I was when I was strong and young and and that's I was eating 6,000 calories a day I just was like I read this thing it was like insulin's the most anabolic hormone and I was like done and so more food it was the little that I met she used to make me a box of pancakes for breakfast it was a cake I do half a thing of syrup and I'd pass out again and then I wake up I'd work out I'd have a 1200 calor Shake then I'd have a burrito double meat double rice sour cream chips on the side guac and then I'd get back home for dinner and I'd have one box of pasta and one jar of tomato sauce that's cuz a box pasta is 70 gr of protein yeah I eat pasta a lot I digest it great yeah me too and rice I do really well with bosmal rice I could just eat unlimited amounts can you still eat like that no I can talk about though yeah I eat like out like I go to like a nice restaurant I have a steak and then like chips and something and I'm like oh my stomach all right you want to do side backs oh oh o starting to feel it like gluteous yeah I haven't done those in the long pan with the spit squat yeah so usually when I do my warmup I'll do this guy this yeah not for this I mean I'm more but I'll do that guy and I'll do that the hip flexor one like multi down GL I actually do this up like up yeah but I think I needed a Mobility stuff more than the shr honey you probably could argue that if you took 20 minutes out of your workout and put that into like constructive Mobility you'd be better off well I mean I did way more weight than I normally do so yeah that alone yeah literally today especially so I put um I put one rule for the whole gym is that this machine keeps four plates out oh you want five yeah I think so so do we plan on leaving this building or is this like home this is for the next 3 to5 3 to five I like Vegas a lot more than I think I've liked any City I've lived in as an adult it's just like it's a non-judgmental city everyone pretends to be something and they come to Vegas and they like let their real selves out yeah and I just like being here and so also it's not political cuz it's for tourism so it has to be just neutral so it's not political at all try like it's great for traveling in and out everybody I know comes to Vegas once year anyways so I can see honey pill if I lived in Cincinnati I wouldn't never see you right so I get to like I benefit from those we have direct flight everywhere out 4 hours from the beach in the mountains yeah 30 minutes on the lake we've got the best student dining and shows in the world it's taxfree it's dry which I personally like UFC's here it's their old building I mean it's a perfect setup for this yeah t you don't need like warehouse space too no have to deal with that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right nice nice those a little quar oh yeah just your time under tension is crav cuz you can't skip for the weak Parts it's like that is the weak part right yeah well yeah it's interesting cuz now you have this B of like I want to push but like the risk reward of pushing goes down a lot literally cuz like you really just want to maintain on as little effort as possible or little risk as possible it's hard especially because they added weight cap to everybody in my weight my category except me I got like 2 lb and everyone else got 6 to8 why just because I was unfair people were complaining that people at the height of 61 had an unfair Advantage like statistically or something like no people were just complaining I was the only one in that category so that happened and then now everyone got better so I actually have to improve and like fine tuna but I'm also like the most old broken guy in the category so I also have to be the safest yeah what is interesting from like an investor perspective it's like Risk adjusted return yeah like the same thing yeah if you're at fifth place you should take all the risks you can because if you fail you lost nothing cuz no one cares lit if you win it makes all the difference exctly I've always found it so interesting with repeat Champions uhhuh like and most of them are like I mean Michael Jon's content but he's not happy he's a miserable [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he just found some way to continuously drive his way in a miserable fashion yeah and people look up to that and they want to be that and I'm like he didn't do it right yeah well he did but he didn't right it's just like my goal is my goal rather be happy and have peace of mind rather than yeah and I think and I think if you asked MJ would you rather piece of mind or seventh ring you'd say a seventh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ring oh yeah so I think you Ronnie Coleman would you rather be able to walk or have nine ttles you'd say nine ttles yeah and that's where like you zoom all the way out and it's like making a judgment on anyone else's goals in general is stupid because their goals aren't the same George yeah so I would do it different no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're different like I had somebody a family member tell me they were like I would never live my life like you and I was like no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I would never live my life like you which is why you have your life and I live my life and good thing is you don't have to live mine and I don't to live yours it's interesting about how you define champion too like I had to think about it like a year ago I was like do I want to be the richest man in the world and I was like no I don't think that's my goal so then I was going to ask you that well you're talking about different objectives what is yours honestly I want to is it just be rich as possible no no no it's not I see wealth as a measure of my personal growth yeah because I see entrepreneurship as the most quantitative path of personal adment it's more I want to be the richest man that outs to become come not the richest man in the world now if that happens to become the richest man in the world cool I'm not against it yeah but me measuring my wealth against other people's is not the right game for me yeah but me measuring my wealth against what I believe I can create is a game that I can compete in and will always try to compete and so me seeing like a really hard thing for me was when we sold gym launch my monthly cash flow cuz I was an owner went to zero and I was like that's a mind [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah so I was like all of a sudden even though I had a bunch of cash in the bank account I felt poorer so I was like okay this is weird ooh and so I had to like re-calibrate and that's so I had this year where I started making content about like the meaning of money and like all this stuff that's when I had to redefine like what where am I the most where do I grow the most I grow the most when I work hard on things worth doing and so then it was like how do I Orient my life in a way that I maximize the amount of hard work I do on things worth doing and then once I saw what those days looked like I had a mentor of mine my first boss ever I'd have like a really good week and I was like that was like probably one of the best weeks I've had in my life and she was like not a profound person she was like I'm pretty sure the secret of life is living as many of those days in a row as you can't yeah and she and it was such a tactical like I was like so that's what I'll do I'll I think what are the days that I do my best and how do I live that day as many times in a row as I can and that's pretty much just the path I've been on stuff that has occurred has occurred but that's at least how I think about it and your path of feeling like best days are wealth building for our personal wealth building not like for yourself but your own goals it's usually me creating stuff and so like my arc happens to be business related so like I draw like my books are picture Buzz I draw pics about business I write books about business I make videos about business I make podcasts about business like it's just all I think about and so like if I happen to do that about like electric cars no one would care they'd be like oh he's passionate about it it's sh that I happen to be passionate about something that makes money yeah but it's all I think about I almost am more interested in business than I am doing business like my days I only do do business hardcore 1 to two days a week the rest of my days are making things that help other people do business so like me like doing this is this doing business I mean we make media yeah you know but like also me working out with people that I care about that I enjoy is on my list of things that I do on my best days you enjoy yeah and so I respect that I feel like a lot of people now are almost like they there just so many opinions out there of like what's right to the world rather than to themselves like you said when what's Like A Champion I had this thing when I was young I said I always talk about Champion mentality and had no idea what it meant and I began to Define it and now I need to consistently reiterate that it's my definition of what a champion is what is a champion to me is that the true only thing that a champion does is they make their own rules because they don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with people think they just do whatever they want I agree doesn't mean I'm winning doesn't mean nothing it just means I'm doing whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I want and I'm doing it the best I can and so like for example if they Chang the rules of the game for you that in order to win you had to I don't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kill your liver something no I'm just you whatever then you would have to make the decision do I want to win by the a rules or do I wi my mind exactly and I would leave right that's I think that is the difference between a champion who wins for the approval and a champion who wins for themselves yeah is that if they change the rules if your vision of what a champion is no longer aligns with the third party approval then you don't do it you don't play and I think there's a lot of wisdom in choosing what games to play for sure not feeling like you have to I never want to feel like I have to oh dude my number one rule in life like I'll do everything in the world to not have to do anything so fun story about cabs so you don't know this about me but I trained cabs every single day for more than 10 years and I developed 1090 is in my foot from doing so many set of Cales so I did seven sets of 20 and then your Cal's shown no my Cals are still fine but they were uh they were I had a girl that I did it was like why don't you train your cabs and I was like I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] train them all the times and so that I went from 3 days a week doing them at the end to doing them seven sets at the beginning as in my cabs but this I haven't trained cabs right now like me doing this with you this the first time I've trained cabs in like probably a year really like literally haven't done any reps and it was because I got 10 I I like I I was struggling walking cuz there was some muscle in like the base of my foot it's like under my big toe but I'll do this cuz I had the champ in town so of course maybe now you'll stretch and train Cavs again yeah all I have to do is I have to stretch my CS out oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is a really good cap machine so so that's the thing is like I hate the load but I love the way this the lever is perfect so you don't have to put a lot on it either nice the range of motion moves so much yeah my calvs are going to be crippled just for doing like three sets they're going to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smoked yeah if you don't train Cals they get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] oh you're destroyed yeah the donkey calf over there is what Built My cabs and um standing single leg off a box is his body weight yep yeah I started doing um I did them years ago is one of the things that like broke through my C like growing it's just funny is like I um I I don't train chest anything Asos that last time because I just always had a decent enough chest but like if someone like doesn't know how to grow cabs I'm like I can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tell you how to grow cabs the biggest thing was super deep you already know this but like super deep stretch yeah and so what I would do is I'd do like 20 or 30 reps body weight on one one leg off a box underneath of a pull-up bar and then once I reached failure I would start counting and so then I would do assisted negatives or like you know assisted positives and like the level of pain that like of like cooling yourself to the full Flex yeah when you're just lower oh yeah and then you like let it down and then you you really make sure that you get that last little that last little bit I was like I did it with clients once and I because I had just discovered this technique for myself and I like could barely walk and I did it with these ladies who I was training they came in on so it was like Friday they came on a Monday and they were like they like couldn't they're like I couldn't go to the dance this weekend because I couldn't put heels on they're like literally could not walk like and so I felt accomplished job well done yeah I felt like I did something yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] just like control negative yeah are such a secret to making anything grow I'll do those like I'll go up with two feet yeah and then lift one foot and then lower down like same concept yeah somebody gave me a cue that was trying to get your shoelaces perpendicular just like your foot just cuz you're there like perpendicular like like it you can't really do it but like maybe baller but like it's like so how's being a dad dude it's good it's chaos it's good it's chaos it's up body right good for SLE horrible for bodybuilding but now we've got help at night now which is like oh good the biggest cheat code man like my wife is a saint so she handles like the the hard part of all they not competing anymore no she stopped in 2016 she won the Olympia in 2016 that she kind has some health issues and then just so your kids are a champion breeding stck yeah they are that way used to be Lea got LIF at 315 for reps in the midd gym so I'm just you know I'm just putting it out there yeah you good on this do one more you're do one more I'm going to my CS are going I already know they're going to be cook all right don't worry Daniel I know you wanted the shop there's the shot still got it I'll give give you a lefty or you not anymore I have 10 to 9s in my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] toe now the old man excuse the old man I'm going to do the hit thing cuz I that was the first time I've done legs in a while that I was not with no pain y cuz I do my warmup to get to like a two out of 10 pain I'm like whatever yeah but that was like a one out of 10 like I had some but like how many warm-up sets you normally do of the actual I just recently started doing like three proper the A and that helped a lot yeah I was just going straight and I was like this is horrible yeah that's brutal I feel like it was like my muscles are just tearing off like just not horable yeah no there's like a lot of actual science behind you even just your nervous system turning on with proper warmups and everything your muscles are literally aren't even activating until then yeah they're yeah they're just like what's going on yeah please don't do this nice okay oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] easy this is such we it's the best cap machine ever used dude it's good this one's sweet because you can have the full stack this this is where I I built this and the and standing uh single leg are the two things that like Built My CS but like this guy like all the way up and just like yeah who makes this this is nebula nebula yeah where' you find this hard to find I us have all these dealers that I have like on speed dial they like kind of serious I don't I like the way this feels and also feels really good gives you a crazy stretch CU they bent over yeah yeah it's one of those ones where when you put weight on it like is even better kind of thing you do 400 lb am weight on top I did when I was at my Peak you're a big boy yeah when I was a big boy yeah yeah I had this 100 lb plate that I had but I haven't done cads in year so we'll see see what my C drink can still like probably bad Kevin's going to make a maelly motivation video of you nice yeah yeah that's where I like smoke those yeah this also goes up too so you can adjust uh this yeah so you can go up a little higher for cuz I was on lless setting come I'm good like that yeah but know I like I mean it's a big piece but um I TR I I mean I train on this every day for a real time that and the single Lake are the two things that I did for my C did you have all this somewhere else before you moved here yeah my my house in Austin I had had I had like half the I had everything I about half these pieces do you want to do something else my legs are cooked but I can do whatever I'm with the champ so I mean we can do a little quick quens all today okay unless you're cooked cook no I can do like zero rest back and forth mhm people are like you're taller than I expected so thanks Cuz um Trevor you Dr cash you near him anyways no he's like you have sh eye proportions he's like so on camera he's like you look like you're five five yeah so my my legs are actually super short which is good for like leg moves like I have super short femur really long torsa are they good for squatting yeah did you pull Sumo or conventional Sumo oh God this guy I pull conventional t on my back and that switched to Sumo then I hurt my hips yeah I was 100 lbs weaker on Sumo than conventional I could do so much more volume on Sumo yeah and so that kind of made up for it but weirdly my deadlift made its biggest gains this is going to sound insane doing one set of 20 a week like your one R Max did cuz I did the same I did like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pyop pin chart and you know like 531 like I did all of the low rep like three sets of four all the tradition and like my deadlift didn't move for like 3 years and I was like I was like competing and like carage I was like so upset about it and so then I was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it and so jug I don't know if you know jug or not GT jts Chad Wesley Smith okay well he was the power lifting world yeah yeah so he was yeah he was being in the power lifting worlds like football training and stuff and so we had this thing called The Jug jug method this is like 10 years ago and it was all this super high rep stuff he basically took wendler's 531 which is a parallel thing program and just like tripled the bullet so instead of like sets of 53 and one it was sets of like 201 151 yeah but like am wraps I basically ignored everything in the program but the deadlifts was like 20s and I was like well I'll do that I'll see how that goes and I just I just did sets of 20 and I added 10 lb a week and I did it for like 16 weeks and added like 160 lb to my 20 and I was like so did your W Max go up too though oh yeah well I mean I'm guessing cuz I was close to my one rep max on my 2 R Max by the true yeah yeah so hopefully yeah so like the end of it I did like I think I did I have a video of doing like 465 for 20 Jesus and then I was like this is stupid that's enough oh yeah and this is when I was eating like the 6,000 calories a day thing the burritos oh dude I was like you know Milos is the one who said like there's no such thing as overtraining only undereating and like I say as a natural guy who did that um I feel like I can kind of attest to it like I drink a lot of volum how old were you 25 yeah I mean I feel like when you're 25 and under around there you can do whatever you want I I at the gym I was a gym owner I lift the gym yeah and I trained that was all I did I ate and I trained that's literally all I did when I was doing that it was eight hours a day of food and training yeah I've decreased my loading increased my warm up everything more like proper and I'm just in more pain out you said you do more warm up less volume and you're in more pain is I that sounds right yeah so that's what I was doing I did the 20 rep sets for deadlift and I was doing uh three sets of 20 on Squat and I got up to 45 for 20 well barell back squats we're squatting we're squatting I was I was 235 natural that's big I mean that's a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for natural that's a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] R um and uh and then um I benched so bench has been my biggest natural LIF like built a bench every time I touch the bench it blows up and so I don't bench which is why I into it but for the six I only did it for 6 weeks I put 35 lbs on naturally I the pictures musle what was your 20 rep max for bench so I hadn't benched in like a year or two yeah but I did it for this little cycle and so I was doing seven sets of everything seven sets of bench seven sets of not deadlift and squat but seven sets of rows leg presses I did banded leg press seven sets of 20 yeah that's how I grew I was I started as 245 for seven sets of 5 and 6 weeks later I benched uh 3.95 for one and I had never like I didn't put a yeah anything on there so like I think the week of I did like 335 for 7 sets of five like six weeks yeah but but I like I cuz I only had that in that one lift and then I just know that there are guys who have that on all their lifts it's just like that's my worst lift so it's your bench that is that horrible bench my one rep max ever was 415 you were probably bodybuilding bench right I was like power of thing benching which is 6 in so when you train I mean do you do you have programming that you follow this year is the first year I had ever follow in a program I love that like that confir like it's so confirming I mean you know it in your field there's an art to being good yeah and you it's you if you think you need to follow a perfect program yeah if someone took everything I did orever someone have took everything you did and did it again even if you did it that you were following a plan instead of just doing it naturally you wouldn't be here yeah it's really interesting because the hardest thing to develop is intuition it's like how can like when when you're like I got it today I'm going to I'm going to gas it like can someone teach you that I don't know I mean I definitely know like for work I have seasons where like I gas it you know what I mean where I'm like I'm working 16 hours I'm taking every stimulate I know of and like and I'm like not getting as much sleep as I should but I can just keep pushing and then there's some days where I like wake up and I'm like no not today night today yeah and so I I was I was I put it on my my profile was like I don't have like I work like weekday weekends are all the same for me so basically I wake up if I feel good I work and if I wake up and I feel like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I change this the nature of the work I do yeah so it's like if I don't feel good I'll play more meetings I'll take more calls cuz I'm not like I'm not going to be doing deep work yeah but if I wake up and I'm like dude I could cure cancer today then I'm like all right let me write a book chapter like let me script out like a a a presentation or something that's like really deep and I'll just tell the team like cancel some of my calls or move them like I'm going to be in the zone today yeah but I also Imagine over time whether consciously subconsciously you know that like when you wake up on those shitty days doing certain things that you can at least do uhhuh at the right capacity will put you back into a place where you feel good to oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] where most people are like I'm going to take the day off I don't feel good and then next thing you know it's been a year and they've taken the whole year what's up Julio I'm glad you came for legs cuz legs is what like I can push on upper body but like I hesitated I was like I want to ask someone to train legs with me and I was like yeah [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it we I'll trade with you I got the Hotpot okay you guys know seum he was TI it on so with some of the drinks the seum Ks are his his uh and then you get this probably even more than I do but like the generic hey big guy like hey Jim that way or whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] no matter what someone says and you know half the time it's some sort of left-handed compliment or whatever I just say like just trying to catch up to you bro and so it doesn't matter what they but like I've had so many people who like said something meane and I'm like she trying to catch up to you bro and then they're like ah Fu I was being dick you know and that that's always been my my big counter yeah for some reason I always get people like are you like that se bum guy and my response is just no but I get that all the time and then like probably % the time people are like oh and then I just walk away that's it I'm also equally awkward and antisocial so if someone comes up and like do I know you're from somewhere I'm like I don't know probably not and then I just leave not from somewhere so training wise you just Train by feel and you just consistently out waight when you can I have a program now well every year but until now I was pretty like consistent in what I would do and movement I just knew in my brain yeah I know like my top movements when I start if it's incline chest dumbbell press it's if it's pendulum squat if it's de Ben over Rose I'm like last year did this much so I'm going to do this much this week yeah and youed work to like I'm going to add 20 lbs to it or 30 lbs or it was for a while it was like all right I'm going to do this for six and then I got eight and I got 10 I'll put a 25 on I'm back down to six and eight and then 10 all the stuff that I know is like stick to a handful of lifts don't do a lot of variation slowly i' progress it you know reps or weight right but then like I just noticed that I had less motivation to train and so like I was more prone to skip days and things like that yeah and like this was today was harder than I would normally train my legs so I'll probably like it'll probably [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] my like I'm supposed to train legs tomorrow yeah so I just like I'll probably if you train L tomorrow I'd be impressed yeah yeah so I'll just like I'll skip that and maybe I'll skip a second like cuz it's every other day so I would have trained Lakes tomorrow and two days from there so I'll probably just skip the next two and then hit it again like if you don't have that flexibility like if you were in town like oh I'm falling like why bother like you what I mean like I've had people there's like three you know Fitness dudes who have you know whatever they were in town I saw this kid who's like not a competitor he was like I'm following a program and so all the dudes were lifting all the big guys are lifting together throwing weights R and he's like sitting Indian style ins side like I'm following it's like dude you're missing the point yeah like you're not going to get be like 40 and be like man I'm really glad I followed that progress I was 22 and you know training with those guys and then going home being fired up about training with them what result till your list going up more too right the motivation you get from that would be more oh so much more yeah like and in the memory and like all the positive experience that come from it did you listen to music when you train yeah what do you listen to it varies alternative rock Eminem Kanye West 9s hip hop yeah I listen to more or less the same stuff I'm not a music person it's the only time I listen to music is when I train yeah and so I like so bad that a friend of mine from high school gave me this CD it was rap CD 1 through six and I uploaded it on my iPod and then like I went through all of college and then we were hanging out a couple years later he's like so what you you know what do you listen to now on your train I was like the N that you made me and he was like the what and I was like yeah the one that you made me he was like in high school and I was like yeah rap CD 1 through six I still listen to he's like dear God he's like dude there's been things that have Haden he's like Eminem's had two CDs since then I'll make you a new mix and SPO out by then you just still have an iPod like I've got a zoon yeah I didn't even have one of those yeah it's weird because now I'm turning to 35 in like a couple months in August and I was like I am like like when I it before I turned 30 I was like young and successful and now I'm just a white dude yeah I felt that too I was like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're only 25 and you won the Olympia now you're like all right you're the old guy now yeah you're just yeah it's I'm just a guy yeah what's interesting with um like with the Olympia in terms of like competitive landscape and whatnot is that like in the game of business everyone is a competitor like everyone's in the game it's just some people don't know it and that's what I find kind of interesting about like the business world is like you compete against the world and it's Global yeah and you compe against guys they 90 and like like kind like you can't age out how old was Kendall Jenner she be she became the youngest self-made billionaire and then they revoked it they did like she wasn't actually or yeah the numbers weren't what she overstated some of her numbers like 9 months later after she got into all of the pr after I had gone into a deep 7-Day depression because of how inadequate I felt as a result of compared to this little w yeah no I mean it was actually like it was actually weirdly it was a it was a it was a career defining moment for me really it sounds ridiculous to say when I saw her on the cover fors a 19 years old as a billionaire I felt like a failure I I did I was I was 20 I think I was 26 or 27 can't remember it was and I I taken home $17 million in income that year and I was like I'm hot [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cool and then it was just like 19-year-old girl billionaire I was just like I suck at everything and that was actually the moment where I was like she understand so I fundamentally think that if someone makes more money than me then they know something about business that I don't she was the one that got me on to brand was that she was able to make than me because she had a brand and I was like maybe there's something to this and I did I also encourage your philosophy to not compare to other people though H well to compete against yourself and all that so yeah yeah so there's a really good one there is that there's a difference between criticism and and uh insults so if you insult thought yourself and you make a judgment if you criticized you point out a discrepancy so she's bigger than I am in this way why that's criticism like I could do better judgment is and because of that you are bad yeah all right be easy my friend yes sir appreciate you gin appreciate you have a wonderful day guys
