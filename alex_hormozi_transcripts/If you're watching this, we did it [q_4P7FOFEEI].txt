So if this if this part is coming out after the event then let me tell you let me tell you some stuff. So $100 million as a title I thought would be perfectly demonstrated by having a launch of $100 million which no one has ever done before but you can't just do that from scratch. It's like you have to build a lot of things. And so then it started with okay so I have to build this brand. I have to put this content together. So I started doing that and then you have to like the like Harry Potter 7 is bigger than Harry Potter 1 2 3 4 five I think in to six maybe or not 1 2 3 4 5 I think in aggregate first day sales just crazy right and so the only way that happens is if you continue to overd deliver on the promises you make right and so I had to write not one but multiple good books to continue to give those books surface area or rather to put those books out there so that they would be the surface area that people could come in contact with my brand. &gt;&gt; And so people who like line up before the book release on Harry Potter &gt;&gt; and so the most elegant thing I could think of is the third book in the series called $100 million Money Models. The one that's about making money, making the $100 million to demonstrate that anyone can do it if they are have the skills and they have the patience. And so that's what would be really elegant. I hope I do that. We'll say, but like that's um &gt;&gt; that would be that would be super elegant. &gt;&gt; How many books would that be? &gt;&gt; 100 um be like 3.3 million. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Books, &gt;&gt; which would be the third biggest book of third or fourth biggest book of all time of all time. &gt;&gt; Below the non-fiction record. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Double the nonfiction. &gt;&gt; Double more than double the noniction &gt;&gt; cuz cuz &gt;&gt; we would we would uh we would unseat two Harry Potter books, &gt;&gt; right? Cuz what? 7 7 million is the top &gt;&gt; 16 million. &gt;&gt; No, top one is 14 and 12 million. &gt;&gt; 142. Okay. &gt;&gt; What? She's in another seven. It's the seventh book. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Deathly Hallows. Yeah. &gt;&gt; She's the goat. &gt;&gt; She's on She's in the stratosphere. &gt;&gt; World building. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, 100%. It's &gt;&gt; your like business world building. &gt;&gt; Oh, totally 100%. It's the Mosiverse, you know, whatever. Like that sounds so so sketchy. I regret saying that. But point is &gt;&gt; she's in the Mosiverse. The main character is in the &gt;&gt; I was like I don't give a about this. She's like he wrote a book. Who cares? Um &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; you don't ask me anything. &gt;&gt; Bob, what do you think about the book launch? &gt;&gt; Sorry, can I give you this? &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yeah, Leila's been a sport. What do you think about the next book? &gt;&gt; I think it's really good. &gt;&gt; Do you think it's better than the other other two? I think it's much more similar to offers but more applicable because &gt;&gt; offers is like you have to create something out of nothing whereas this one I think you can have something and apply it or not have something and apply it. So it makes it easier to apply. &gt;&gt; I agree. &gt;&gt; What do you think about the launch? &gt;&gt; I don't know. I'm not as bold as a side. &gt;&gt; You think it's a good idea? I think what's more interesting is hearing what it's like to prepare for a launch that you know that many people are watching you. I think that's more fascinating than hearing about the book itself. &gt;&gt; Should you share some of that? &gt;&gt; I don't even think people would believe it. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; The amount that I've put into this launch. I feel like we should talk about it because I think it's not conceivable for one and I think explaining to people like what is it what's going what goes inside what goes on inside your head like what happens on a daily basis like what are the sacrifices you have to make does it take a toll on you does it not take a toll on you like that's actually what I find very interesting &gt;&gt; yeah so um fortunately unfortunately the way that my brain works is I'm an objectivist and so I think okay how much would I prepare prep for a 5,000 person stage. I would prepare like crazy, you know, for a stage like that. And I think that we'll probably have somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 to 500,000 people who are there live. And so it would be an order of magnitude or multiple orders of magnitude larger than that. And so it would make sense, it would follow that I should do 100 times the preparation. But if I would prepare a week or more for a 5,000 person stage, then it would mean that I would prepare a 100red weeks or more, which is about as much as I prepared for this event. And so a lot of I think what people don't know is that every single word that you have read or consumed anywhere in relation to the launch really in general but in relation to this launch I wrote I wrote the money models book I wrote the audio book that was a gift for the affiliates who refer 10 people or more which is a whole separate book. Uh if this is coming out after the event I wrote the secret book which is another book that has 24 chapters in it. Uh I have the money models book that I wrote. Um I wrote the 12 playbooks which is like 600 pages. Uh it's like a it's like two fantasy novels of but business tactics. I wrote I wrote the ACQ I rewrote the ACQ closer handbook. I rewrote and edited made it cleaner and better etc. The uh ads handbook. Uh I wrote all the copy for all the pages. I wrote all the copy for all the emails. I wrote all the text copy. Um I wrote every VSSL. almost every video since there's six um in this because we have the affiliate signin, affiliate onboarding, we have the sales page, we have thank you page one, thank you page two, thank you page three, um we have thank you page for uh postevent one, two, three. Uh we have onboarding. Yep. We have the other affiliate video. So all of those scripts I wrote the webinar &gt;&gt; um which is a lot of words. Yeah, I'm still actively writing. Well, the the webinar is written. I have to put in the slides now. So, I wrote the words, I put the slides in. Um, &gt;&gt; what's it like having to do that much? &gt;&gt; Uh, I think it's just I think it's looking at the mountain of work and just being like, I will I will make progress. &gt;&gt; Do you ever get nervous? &gt;&gt; Not really. &gt;&gt; Concerned. Yeah. Like if some if I'm like, "Okay, well, if something doesn't make sense, I'm like, this doesn't make sense. Why would we put that there or like oh, we can't when someone's like, I we can't do that and it would make sense and it doesn't make sense why we can't do something." Trying to figure out, oh, the tech won't do this or whatever. That's that's that can be painful. And sometimes that eats up like two days. It's like boom, I have to dive deeper. &gt;&gt; Like going into the warehouse and being like, we might not have enough guys. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just stupid right? Like we went to the warehouse for one of the warehouses and I was like, "Hey, so how you know, hey guys staffed up and we they already, you know, we'd already been given assurances that everything was going to be fine." And then they were like, "Yeah, we think we're going to have 20 guys extra, you know, just for yours." And I was like, "20?" I like, "Well, how many books do you think someone puts out?" And they're like, "Well, I mean, 20 bucks an hour." And I was like, "Can we do math here? Like 400 bucks an hour?" I was like, "How many hours are they going to work?" Eight straight. Okay, fine. So that's 3,200 bucks, right? Well, I did 20 guys times times 20. So 400 an hour times 8, right? 32. Am I messing that up somehow? No, I think that's what it's 3200. Yes. 3200. 3200 bucks. It's nothing. I was like, okay, well, if we sell 3 million, are we going to have a,000 days? Like what are we what are we talking about? &gt;&gt; Wait until 26 to get. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Ridiculous. So anyways, I had to like do math with it. Just like little things like that. Um, &gt;&gt; are you sleeping much? &gt;&gt; No. No. No. I can tell you actually. I can tell you exactly how many hours I'm sleeping. I'll tell you my last &gt;&gt; put in death's door. I know saying. &gt;&gt; Sean says old man mo reaper is knocking. &gt;&gt; Old man mosy. Yeah. Look. Okay. So, I got 5 hours and 45 minutes last night. 5 hours and 20 the night before. 5 hours and 17 the night before that. 654 the night before that. &gt;&gt; You hung out with me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I got 646 before that. &gt;&gt; Hung out with me that night. &gt;&gt; 7:45. That was Saturday. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That was on my birthday. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that was your birthday. Uh 620 545 515 520 447 ah 8 That was a nice one 4 hours 519 618 515 so like &gt;&gt; well and I love you had this tweet that's like everyone's got battered like no one's playing it 100%. Is it kind of like &gt;&gt; Yeah. No one's explain people like oh like like I did dude I only slept five hours last I said like the out of here like come on what are we I mean Dana has got a baby like you mean like honestly I think I think about you if I'm ever like oh I'm tired I'm like I don't have a one-year-old what am I talking about &gt;&gt; you got three children you got three most &gt;&gt; yeah well yeah they don't wake me up at night I wake up at three or four &gt;&gt; never Oh yeah it's immediate yeah and so it's never &gt;&gt; Yeah it's Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why you say we're all going to be depressed after Pokémon launch? &gt;&gt; You will be guaranteed. Well, it's just it's a it's um it's a climactic event. So, there's going to be a a down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, we've been I mean, the team isn't preparing. &gt;&gt; You will be physiologically depressed. Not like physiologically you'll be depressed. Your cortisol, all that. You'll get a big dump after the event's over. But we have it. We have the nice thing that we have that's different than last year. Last year was one moment. This day will be three days. So, it'll spread it out a little bit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but then after that it's going to be it's going to be a little bit more little more chill. But the thing is is fortunately or unfortunately we're gonna have the launch $100 million launch. &gt;&gt; The event &gt;&gt; and then we're going to have the first event for the playbooks. &gt;&gt; So I'm going to have to I'm going to have to keep going. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; we got to get some offers. Get the book. &gt;&gt; We're not coming with you. So &gt;&gt; all right. Are we cutting? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's cut. Hey.
