if you want to use organic marketing to get more leads for your business or you're starting from scratch whether it's a new department or brand new for your business I talked to a room full business owners for eight hours and this is one of the best moments that we pulled out of just talking about organic strategy to help them make more money there these two worlds where there's like the world that makes money and just needs traffic and the world that has so much traffic and has no money and so when you learn how to marry those two you just make absolutely obscene amounts of money um I mean like Logan Paul merging with Prime like he had the audience in the traffic and then he had a way to make money Mr Beast with the chocolate like he had he had distribution he just needed a product Alex rosi needed a product for the distribution base school right tons of traffic where do we send it right now if you have paid ads starting organic will immediately make the paid ads more profitable because what will happen is people will look at the ads then they will look at your organic and then they will take the next step even if they took the next step and booked a call they will actually show and if they show they'll have a higher percentage of closing like don't worry about the views and all of that stuff that happens in the early days just keep making it and just think about in the beginning as lead nurture in the early days it'll be nurture as you get bigger and bigger it'll become acquisition but just from a value perspective if you can just make that shift it'll make your life a lot easier from a scaling organic perspective I I tend to always start with an agency uh for every new medium or platform that I want to go on now if you don't want to do that that's fine I just prefer to buy lessons and Shrink my timelines and so I started with a guy that I think I was paying like five grand a month in no way was he special basically did nothing um but it kept me accountable to making three videos a week and so I would do that and he would post them I still don't really know how to post a video on YouTube um so I say that because uh if you just focus on making the content exceptional like it will grow like it absolutely will grow and just my recommendation is do not promote in the content to the greatest ever so think about it like this is that you want to have this big valuable thing all this content that you're teaching the ctas in my opinion in content are not very effective like they kill reach it feels weird no one likes it whatever people will naturally just take the next step if you put it in the descriptions you put it in your link your link in BIO like you do those two things you will get traffic to your stuff by just saying this is what I do rather than hey by the way like I just I don't think that's the right way to do it the beautiful merger of these who here knows how to run ads just like get a show of hands okay so like half of you guys okay where the magic happens is where you build all the Goodwill for free and then you use ads to do the ctas and so has anyone here read the leads book okay so there's the whole content section about the give ask ratio the unfortunately based on the book and the limitations of the book I can't get into like more advanced stuff where it gets really juicy is that all of your content is only give and then the ads are the ask so then you don't have to balance a give to ask ratio you just only give in content and then the ads serve to be the CTA and for whatever reason it protects the brand it's a totally different vibe if I was if I was like right hooking every video be like hey go to here go to here go to here people would be like whoop and then that that would be it like no one would watch my stuff anymore but if I keep providing value they get value I deposit Goodwill and then later we can hit them with an advertisement to go do something and they exist completely separately and so we just want to think about the Mind space of like the 3 to1 ratio still exists if you think about someone's news feed so they have like content one from you content two from you content three from you and then they have an ad from you and so here's the money one and all this other stuff is free and so think about it from a larger perspective and that's this is this is where like this is where the obscene money is what do you guys have questions about here all right so I'm going to just ran at you for a second and try and cross as many of these out as I can so from a like topics volume like these kind of all go together so so Evelyn for you if you're looking at I make this really Niche content I need to go wide in my experience like keep making the content that's going to serve your avatar if you want to have I would say like if you want to sprinkle in I just consider it further top of funnel and so like we have made some of these like I made one video on some meal stuff I did um and I would say that for us we kind of swing a little bit like a pendulum where I I only like making business content the team will urge me to not make business specific content so that we can appeal to a wider audience from time to time and usually like the more I do this I'm like ah I and then I swing back over here and I'm willing to know that the volume drops and I'll just tell you let me just share this experience with you so we did um we did a workshop here that's why it's set up like this and I asked the room I said hey uh of the content that I make which you guys are consuming like the case study stuff where we like build out a sales team and like like how we do onboarding and like all that stuff and here is consuming like lessons to my younger self the whole room was this side and so even though these got onethird the views of these ones sometimes this can introduce people like the right people will then just think about as top of funnel like this gets more people in they'll see other stuff you have and then they'll go down the longer more Niche videos that's specific to them now the other people who just come for that well they'll wait till you have your next one of that and then YouTube or whatever will display it to them um so that's from a topic perspective I would say if you do like four like 3 to one four to one in terms of your Longs like one I go a little bit wider and the rest I still stay on topic you'll probably get the best of both worlds what I would tell you though is that I think your stuff's really good and I I think you just need to get you need to learn more presentation skills and that's okay that's not like this is me trying to help um and so I think that you could probably take the same content you're currently making and just simply structure it better and you'd probably get 10 times the views a side note for you guys is you'll notice the bigger the Creator usually the less frequent they actually make videos and it's because they realize just power laws exist which is that if you spend 10 times more time on one video it doesn't get 10 times the views sometimes it get a 100 times the views and so qu especially platforms nowadays are so heavily ring on quality you create the quantity to figure out the quality and so in the beginning more people make lots of content and then you start figuring out the stuff that works figuring out the stuff that works and then you'll notice that they're like oh man well we did spend more time on that video okay well if we're going to keep making videos like that I don't think we can make this money but it's okay because you make it up on the fact that the total quality of that one it gets shared more people watch it longer and um I think Mr B said this but it was like if you make 10 videos or you spend 10 times and you make that one video 20% better in terms of ABD or click-through rate you don't get 10 times the views you get a 100 times the views so you get a disproportionate return for quality and so I think it's fine from a from the niche content perspective but I would go really deep on the topic and try and keep it keep it as um congruent with the packaging of the video which is where a lot of people lose off and you need to obsess about your first 30 seconds but like this last uh weekend I watched my top 35 YouTube videos I watched the first three minutes of all of them and I wanted to figure out like what was it that I did in these videos that I didn't do in other videos that had similar average view duration but I didn't like I I I didn't I didn't carry as many people through and um I'll just share this with you the three PS that I found at least for us which is promise proof path and so you want to cover that and this is where this is for you in terms of the big difference between Ed Educators and entertainers they don't think that way and maybe I'll find out in two years I'm wrong here but this is what I think right now which is that like there's a huge there was a huge Obsession of like match the exact words of the headline with the first however many seconds of the video confirm the thumbnail in the in the background and that's really B Because if you say hey we're going to crush a Lamborghini and you they go and it's a talking head there's no Lamborghini they're like screw this and they're out right but if you're educating then I think the Lamborghini in our situation is proof is how what is the big Vegas lights of why should I listen to you sure I want to learn more about guarantees okay but why should I listen to you and if you can answer that as quickly as possible like the the videos that like when I looked at my top ones it was just like hey I sold my company for $ 46.2 million a big part of that was that we had a guarantee that beat all of our competitors and so we did four things that we used that that made our guarantee stronger done and if it if that's what I said the video is about they're like okay there's a promise of what he's going to help me do there's a path and I have proof of why I should listen to this guy and so you want to have that like what's in it for me and why should I believe you and then the the path in my opinion is just to show that there is structure and you can set expectations and then meet the expectations I think that's more about watch time uh the first two are about why should I stay and then the that's the what's going to happen I will probably write a book on branding at some point I think I have significantly increased my understanding what like what a brand is and so I think first starting with the term of defining it which is it's an association between two things like that's what a brand is it's between things that people know it's people that they don't know and so branding is also a word for teaching like if I say if I I wear a hat in every video then people start to associate the hat with me right and if I provide value eventually you can take the hat off and people still associate the value with the hat fundamentally that's what branding is and so if you're trying to make content about a certain topic they will associate you with that topic and so if you want to be known for a certain thing like that like the background everything that goes into it people make associations that's how we learn right and so there are three elements to Brand the first is the strength of the influence when people see me or see a logo or see something does it change their behavior and and so if we were to go to the atmology of the word basically where it first began branding was like if I branded a cow right you brand a cow it's got It's got a mark on it the reason for that was because it would change people's behavior if I saw a cow that didn't have a brand a cow that did have a brand I would maybe catch this cow I would leave it alone i' do whatever but the one that has Rick's logo on it I might give it back to Rick or i' kill Rick if I or kill the cow I hate Rick or i' steal the cow either way the brand I would treat this cow differently than the cow that had no brand and so Brands change Behavior at scale that's why they're so valuable and so the question is from an influence is what percentage of people does it change their behavior if it changes a lot of people's behavior Donald Trump changes a lot of people's behavior now the next question is is that behavior going towards or is it going away for some people it's very strongly towards and other people it's very strongly away but he changes people's behavior so he has strong he has a strong brand from an influence perspective the directionality is going to depend on the person and then the next piece the third piece is just the reach which is how many people in general have this association with you and so if you're thinking I want to build a brand then you think about the hypothetical Max of what a brand would be which is you'd want as many people as humanly possible moving towards you and all changing their behavior at once when they see your thing that would be the hypothetical Max of a brand right like Taylor Swift has a brand that's very close to this everyone knows who she is she has a very strong brand in terms of changing people's behavior and they tend to move in the direction that she wants them to go so I also kind relatively reject the concept of all all publicity is good publicity I would just say all publicity is publicity it will increase the reach of your brand it won't increase necessarily these two but it will increase the reach more people will know about you and so it's just being specific about what a brand actually is and so if you understand that a brand is built through associations then you're also very careful about who you choose to be uh who you choose to appear next to right and so there's a reason that um I don't speak on stages anymore that I don't own mostly because the audience will associate me with the other speakers and I often don't want to be associated with the other speakers um podcasts even to a certain degree have the same thing they spend an hour with me and this other person and I've become more and more strict about this to the point where I really don't appear like I'm not really trying to appear with anyone anymore you are always going to be the purest version of your brand like you are your brand and so you leaning into to more of you is the stuff that's going to accomplish these things and if some people are turned away from you that's fine but what we can do to change that is we try and reach as many people as we can and we try and provide value to those people so that they change their behavior and ideally go towards us I just wanted to draw that out for you guys CU I thought hopefully that was helpful Niche versus white algorithm uh big picture here don't worry about it like always just align your objective with the platform like hacks are stupid because if you grow off of a hack like hashtags work or whatever as soon as they close the loop because all platforms do you'll just go down to zero it's not a long-term strategy so just why do it in the short term if it's not going to work long term the long-term strategy of every platform is to keep people on the platform and so they want you to make content that lots of people click on and that lots of people watch all the way through and ideally watch something else from you so everything that they do in the algorithm is just to always optimize for those three things and that's not going to change now the math that they do to code it might change but the objective will always be the same and so if you aligned your objective with the algorithm's objective you will never have an issue and that goes for shorts it goes for Longs like that's why the Hook is so important because they want to they will see that a lot more people are making past the first 3 seconds so we will show to more people and if a lot of people watching all the way through they'll show to even more people and that's all it is because we're aligning our objective with theirs that's it okay shorts versus Longs um in the beginning think about a long as just many shorts put together just from like if we have that path that I was talking about like think about your path as the seven shorts that you're going to string together you just don't have necessarily 60 seconds that you have to get it you can get to 90 seconds whatever but you still structure them the same way and that will be beneficial for you but in terms of Longs there's only three formats you've got lists steps and stories and you can intermix all three of them so you can have a list of things and have steps within the list and then tell stories about each step but all three can be intermix because that's fundamentally like what content is is it's lists steps and stories volume max so from a volume perspective we put out if you want to like blow blow your mind uh we put out 350 pieces a week so put 50 pieces out a day um across all platforms I would start with something that you can commit to and then basically you just keep ramping up and the big the big Flex on this is understanding where you get double triple qule quintuple dips um on content and so a lot of people don't know this but the highest leverage thing that I do with my time is I make tweets those tweets are actually the like the life source of everything so my tweets which I think you have to have a couple ways that you want to capture like you everyone captures content differently but for me if I get an idea I can tweet it in two seconds it's not it's not it's not hard for me to do that and so by doing that I Capture Moments throughout the day and then when we do record with the team they'll pull up my tweets and be like what was this about and then I have content on that and then when they're like what do we Capt in this Instagram they take my tweet and so I get and then the tweets themselves become reals and I can also say the Tweet out loud and make it a video and so all of these things all stem from one place and when I had gym launch before I was public this actually was an old habit of mine cuz I actually had this big email thread to myself which was like lessons and failures throughout the year and every year I kept one email thread that whenever I'd learned something I would just send it to that that thread so I'd keep it and I just replac that with Twitter and I just now word them slightly better um but I think you need to have a repository for where your ideas are going to go as they come up throughout the week if you don't know topics that you can go on look at your calendar look at every single meeting you had that week and what you spent your time on and that will give you more than enough content to talk oh yeah I had this meeting and had this uh one of my clients had this issue with her order bump and it wasn't working and so this is what we did right great content but like if unless you look retroactively you might not think about it when you're on the spot and so one is that I always I document in real time through tweets or emails do whatever you want you can have notes on your phone two is I look at my calendar of like what what did I do this last week that was interesting or like that I learned or something that came up from a meeting perspective the third category is far past so like what are the what are the big lessons that have that changed or shifted my beliefs that are valuable to somebody else and so you've got far past you've got recent pass which is your calendar you've got real time which you do your Tweet dumps on and then um the kind of like fourth category you can look at is what I call manufactured which is like I lived on $100 for a month which is much closer to entertainment I don't really do much of that but it is another bucket of like topics of content I started a school Community from scratch and this is what I did like that would be manufactured right and so that's how I think about it from a topical perspective that keeps it both interesting and endless um that like we never have a lack of content like we always have stuff how do you get those Frameworks out of yourself because I think that's one thing that sets you really hard is that you framework everything do you have a method turn now yeah um I actually have an answer to this now I've gotten that question a zillion times but I do have an answer now so like the framework for making Frameworks is that if even if I'll just use the micro story I had about promise path plan right if I have to do something repeatedly and I have to do it over and over again I want to create some sort of templates I don't have to remake the same decisions or have to resolve the same problems and so I tend to then drink in a ton of data so I watched 35 of my YouTube videos the intros and then I was like okay what are what are all the things that happened in each one of them so I wrote them all down and then I was like okay well this one had five things this one had seven things this one had two things okay well what did they all have in common well they all had these three things and so then you narrow it down to what are the few fact basically delete everything and if we only had these are the three things that they all had and so this was the same thing when we had um gym launch I didn't know how to retain customers I was really good at selling them but the gym members like I had industry average turn and what we did to solve that problem was that I uh got my customer base I said who here has less than 3% monthly churn for six or eight months and so there 20 gyms that had that out of however many thousand and so I got them on a call and I said okay tell me every single thing you do to retain customers and each one of them had 20 plus things that they were doing but when I interviewed all of them all of all 20 of them were only doing five things in common and those became the five Horsemen retention which is became the framework for how we retain customers in a gym and so you drink in a ton of data you get everything and then you Circle where are the commonalities and then if I want to make it sexy I try and have them be the same letter promise path plan easy to remember or make it an acronym something like that but that's fun like that's the real process and then the the the naming thing is the is super easy so that's that's how we make Frame Works go ahead what's your take on controversy for content and brand so I'll say this and this should hopefully put a lot of you guys at ease I actually don't think you can be canceled I just don't think it's true you can only be canceled if a platform if all means of communication that you can communicate with an audience are removed from you like you are unable to communicate and you stop making content R Kelly has been canceled because he also stopped making content now he did I'm trying to think of like the most hypothetical extreme of terrible scenario right I would bet I mean you look at con right he can say anti-semitic stiff whatever he continues to make content and people still continue to follow him like you become uncan as long as you don't accept that you can be canceled and I think fundamentally that's it now from a controversy perspective on that the sheet that I had over earlier about reach controversy helps you get reach the other two maybe maybe not and so thinking about like what like it's basically the same as getting on a trending topic like to me controversy and Trends are the more or less the same thing um like more people on average will be interested or at least click it drives CTR but what do I want them to like I would not want to associate with a lot of different controversies so I don't talk about them I personally don't talk about that stuff it's just I don't I don't care enough but yeah some people do I don't you have a good feel on organic in terms of making content where the topics come from algorithm stuff shorts versus longs find one person to hire 10 people who's really smart overpay them volume comes from commit to what you can and then slowly ramp up the volume is really so that you learn the quality more than anything else and then product Market fit the customers that you have are going to come from the the the niche content even if it doesn't get many views Sor one question sure agency or Star did hires people I I did both um so I mean I first started with the agency and then I was like okay now we're we're really serious basically when I sold gym launch I was like okay now I can really do this when I had gym launch and I was just starting some of the YouTube videos and uh podcast I had a podcast agency that just posted it and I had a YouTube agency that posted it and then when we were like okay we're really doing this I brought Caleb in he then started managing the agencies and then he hired people in house to replace them and basically I literally outlined the step in the book on agencies but there's going to be a period where they work and your team works so you pay twice and until your team beats their team and I tell them I'm like I'm going to beat you that's all I'm trying to do here and as soon as our team beats their team they go away how do you actually find like a good agency or a good the creative director talk to 10 listen to all of them you'll quickly see who has their together and who doesn't you can also bid them against each other if you really want to but I rarely do that I usually just quickly see who's good and who isn't and I try to go offer referrals of people cuz good like I'll say this the best agencies don't need to run ads like they have more customers than they can handle food nom nom
