what's going on OSI Nation you're here with Alex fosi YouTube's richest YouTuber uh or richest YouTuber to be um I'm King for those you guys who don't know me my name is Alex rosi we own acquisition. comom we do about $85 million a year I got a question the other day that was five things that millionaires think about uh that poor people don't and I wanted to change that to billionaires uh and that is because a lot of millionaires have terrible beliefs and uh you know I tend to agree with Grant Cardone on this one which is uh don't listen to millionaires listen to billionaires so you can choose to listen to me or not I hope that we will be uh billionaires in the next you know 10 to 15 years uh but we still have lots of work to go and hopefully the world doesn't melt down between now and then all right so these are the five things that billionaires think about that millionaires do not think about number one is the size of the opportunity a lot of times millionaires were pursue what most billionaires would consider small fries or small chips table staks things that are just not that interesting um because there's just not a huge amount of growth potential now when you're getting started it's not stupid to Niche down many of the biggest business in the world started with a niche but they had the ability or possibility to build something that was going to be truly enormous and so the total adjustable Market or the potential scale of a business itself is something that a billionaire will think about that a millionaire will not the second thing that millionaires do not think about or mistakenly prioritize is they prioritize promotion over product the biggest question that a billionaire will ask about a company is will people continue to buy this product over and over and over again and stated differently is this something that people will never stop buying if people will never stop buying this thing then it will be inevitable that we will make money right that is how they were thinking most millionaires on the other hand just learn promotion and because that is how they made their first money because they didn't make any money and then they start learning how to promote and they make some money they assume that I should just do more promotion and with the exception of very big Mass Market brands that are direct to Consumer and have big ticket items you know for example solar would be one where you you know promotion is going to matter a lot because you really are going to only send sell someone one time on this for 30 years so promotion is going to matter more in that situation but most businesses have a recurring nature of some sort right and so making sure that the product is good enough that when we put the promotion behind it people do not stop purchasing it so that we can get outsized Returns on our marketing and our business model overall it's something that billionaires will think about and not millionaires the third thing that millionaires will will will will mistake here is they will make the mistake of thinking I can do this myself or I'll just underpay just a handful of people to to to run this with me so they will have what we call the genius with the Thousand slaves model versus army of smarter people so the second criteria that I heard Steven schwarzman who's the uh owner of or not owner the founder of Blackstone he's worth about $30 billion talk about was that first he looks at the size of the opportunity and the second thing that he looks at is drum roll can I find 10 out of T who want to pursue this opportunity and so here's the interesting thing big to Talent only chases big opportunity and the reason and he says this quote and it hit me really hard he said well he didn't say this to exactly but I'm paraphrasing he said it's harder to start a small business than it is to start Blackstone because big talent doesn't want to go pursue a small business opportunity think about that for a second that one totally shook me to my core right is that the reason we have to have these big goals is not just for ourselves to get through the muck of of of wanting more and going and suffering through the trials and tribulations that come with entrepreneurship but also so that everyone around us can stomach it because they believe in where we are going and it is something that is true and it's a vision uh that is compelling uh and the opportunity and also the compensation that they can make right if you you're running a dry cleaning store it's very difficult to attract 10 out of 10 Talent there and I Define 10 out of 10 Talent as people who are the best in the world at the thing right nine out of 10 Talent is the best people in the world that I can attract given my company right and eight is somebody who is very very good at the thing and takes initiative and can yield outsize returns a seven is someone who is functional but has to take direction to execute right and a six and Below you don't want them in your business anyways right and the vast majority of businesses are run by sixes and belows let's be real if you're looking at your team most of the team is probably not best in the world or best in the world that you can get right of course not and that is probably because the size of the opportunity that you're chasing is not that good number four is time Horizons most millionaires and people who don't make a lot of money think in very short time increments they think in this week and this month they're thinking can I make payroll can I make rent and I understand that but the reason that the people gain outsized returns who are wealthier is because they see time as an asset rather than a liability they see time working for them rather than against them they see the opportunity compounding in and of itself because they have time on their side and so the smart person the billionaire will look at the opportunity say does time help me or hinder me in this opportunity because I have this little quote that I like a lot I prefer to play games where if you wait you win I'll say it again I prefer to play games where if you wait you win where success is an inevitable consequence of time you may not know when but you do know whether you will get there I would rather get rich for sure and get rich slowly then never get rich at all always hoping that I'll make it in the next 90 days which is what the vast majority of millionaires think they're only thinking about their next promotion they're only thinking about their next campaign they're only thinking about the next thing they're going to do rather than thinking big picture sure if I do this for the next 10 years what is going to position me for where I want to be and ultimately the opportunity that I want to pursue and five the last thing that billionaires will prioritize over millionaires is brand and this is something that I didn't understand really early on I thought brand was a waste of money I thought branding was stupid but a different way of saying brand is reputation right and I heard a a a man that I that I do business with frequently say this and I really like this a lot he said you only get one name you only get one and I it really it really struck me because I just thought that was such a such a Consolidated way of communicating the point we only get one name and the thing is is that your brand compounds with time the more decisions you make that are integrous that are aligned that are not short-term in thinking that are not sacrificing your integrity to get the short dollar which is candidly what most people do most people do that right and that's why most people have a so so or poor brand right they're like yeah he's pretty good but you know he kind of does some stuff every once in a while that's a little shady right but if you have an impactable brand the other types of people that you will track will be people who have impactable Brands and I can tell you this is that the the the area on the top of the mountain is very very sparsely populated they're not a lot of people at the top they all know each other it's crazy and you know why it's because they seek out people who see the world the same way they see the world and it's an exception to the rule rather than the vast majority and so if you want to have game recognized game if you want those people to sit across the table and look at you as an equal then it starts with the character of the person and if the character is right the billionaire will bet on the character of the individual knowing that they will get to where they're trying to go eventually in enough time because it is in inevitability provided the values continue and so when you're making the business decisions taking the long route that takes longer but will most certainly compound and make you wealthier in the long run is what billionaires will do rather than millionaires all right and so I wanted to make this about billionaires rather than millionaires because candid if you just know how to run some ads You Can Be A Millionaire right you can learn how to promote and sell stuff the stuff you might sell might suck but you might make enough money to be a bli a millionaire but to be a billionaire you got to play the game for a long time which means you have to understand that you must play the game for a long time in order to become a billionaire and if you're playing the game for a long time to be a billionaire then all your decisions are going to be made within that time Horizon and the context that that that that come with that the decision-making process and so if we're thinking about this if there one thing that you can take away from this that billionaires would think about that millionaires do not is understanding the time Horizon right because all of these other components roll into that right if we have a long time Rison we doing this forever I don't want to be the one who's doing it all so I don't want to be the genius with a thousand slaves I want an army of smarter people who are going to do this on my behalf I want 10 out of tens who are pursuing this opportunity and can grow it without me right if I want this to truly be something that is going to change my life I can't pursue a small thing for my entire life I got to pursue something big because it has to be worth it because and I heard this from schwarzman and I love it too he said small goals and big goals are equally hard so you might as well make it worth it right it's just as hard to accomplish making $100,000 a year it is as it is for somebody to make a billion dollars a year think about it the time requirement is the same arguably it's less to make a billion dollars a year you just have to think differently about it if I'm going to be around for a very long time I'm going to outlive my promotion and so only thing that will remain will be the product and what people talk about with the product and the decisions that I chose to make with my brand because I was thinking long term and so everything comes down to this concept which is can you think Beyond this week this month this quarter and think when I look back 80 years from now are the decisions that I'm making right now the ones that I would be proud of that are aligned with the long-term goal of seizing the big opportunity that is worth fighting for and so this is what I have I have learned and gleaned from the the handful of billionaires that I talk to and I constantly am trying to analyze them and think what do they have that I don't and maybe it's that I'm just too young and I just need to keep doing what I'm doing which is often times the response that I get and so anyways mosy Nation the reason I make this channel is uh is because there's a lot of broke people and I don't want you to be one of them these are the traits that billionaires will will will look through the lenses of rather than millionaires who often make short-term short-sighted mistakes um in pursuing uh their goals and so I don't want you to do those so anyways my name is O mosy Like I said acquisition. if you liked it hit sub subscribe if you didn't I'll love you either way and I'll guys see you guys in the next video bye
