[Music] [Applause] so my name is Nadia Kota and as Rob said I head marketing at a company called Venn gage and we're an infographic software and our goal is to make design and data more accessible and more engaging for everybody oh you can really hear me breathe I just want you guys to know that I'm still here so like I said our mission is to make design and data accessible for everyone and over my past few years I've been gage when I joined we were doing about 8,000 M RR at the time and in the past three years we've managed to grow that up to about 350 km RR and we've only had one channel that we've really focused on I was given no budget when I started at ven gage I was simply given one instruction which was to get links and I'll tell you a bit about my background soon but over time what we did is we really focused on organic traffic and content marketing as our focus Channel and in that time we've developed this framework or these 12 principles that we use to guide a lot of the content that we put together so I'll share those principles with you and I will be going relatively quickly the format is I'll tell you what the principle is I'll show you an example and then I'll repeat the principle back to you pretty straightforward but if you guys have any questions my twitter handle is there feel free to tweet at me or you can find me after this but first a little bit of background about myself so I actually don't have an education in business or marketing I actually have a theater degree specifically in a program called devised theatre now my programs main focus was to build productions from the ground up and we weren't given a script or general concept to work with we were simply told to make a show and tell a great story so for many of you who are the founders or the entrepreneurs that your business is and you're probably the sole content creators and the sole marketers you might understand that sometimes having a little bit too much creative freedom can actually be quite stunting so part of the process that my team and I used when we were in this data program was our brainstorming sessions were not about what we were allowed to do but rather about what we were not allowed to do and it's by setting these limitations for ourselves that we are actually able to come up with more creative more engaging and more viral concepts overall so before we get into the real meat of all these principles let me talk to you a little bit about what viral means so the concept of viral is it what it means is it's content that is circulated rapidly and widely from one web user to another so in other words what you're trying to do is you're trying to create this content that the purpose is to circulate across social networks and essentially spread like a virus I'm just going to adjust this a bit is that better can you guys still hear me okay there we go so like I said content that's goal is to circulate across the web like a virus now the problem that a lot of people face is that what we do is we tend to rush into the topic selection process right and typically what we do is we try to approach the type of content that has the most clickbait title and will typically throw a few ideas into a spreadsheet and hopefully use that as this list that will generate content ideas that will last us the entire quarter or the entire year and although this might seem like the most productive process it really isn't if your goal is to create content quantity rather than content quality than sure this process might work for you but if your goal is to really create highly engaging content that excites and engages and acquires more users then it's time to start Rhian visioning that process a little bit and unfortunately a lot of people do think that acquisition is about creating a lot of content but it doesn't really work that way so what is the solution you might be asking well let me tell you how do you create content that sticks in your audience's mind and so I actually googled the phrase how to create quality content that stands out this was the Google suggested query I was curious to see what was ranking on the subject and what people had to say and one of the top ranking articles when I clicked into it said to create engaging and thought-provoking content and I thought well gee thanks for such a great suggestion this is exactly what I'm trying to do the author's following points were to leave your audience with questions provide a promising and thought-provoking introduction and tell a great story and although this provides a good summary of what's needed the article really failed to address a very important question which is how do I create engaging and thought-provoking content how do you leave your readers with questions how do you write a promising and important introduction and how do you tell a compelling story and the truth is it's hard right there's a shitload of competition out there and having to constantly produce engaging and thought-provoking content is not easy but it's easier if you have the right process for creating this content so that's my goal for today is to share with you these twelve framing principles that myself and my team have used to scale up our content and we've gone from acquiring about 400 users a day to 5,000 a day in this man of a few years like I said we had no budget so the first principle that we started using was to solve a burning problem and what this requires you to do is to really put yourself in your audience's shoes and ask yourself what types of problems they're facing and if you don't know what types of problems your audience are facing you can actually ask them by serving them and email the emailing them and reaching out to them even if you only have 10 users even if you only have 40 users and these are the people that are already highly engaged and you can find out what struggles they're facing right now then the next step is to actually discover stories from those answers and use that to fuel the type of content you're creating now how many of you guys are familiar with inbound org it's a marketing site so a few of you it's actually I think growth org now what's big changes on the horizon for inbound but the point is why are amas which is actually a popular form of content YMA is so popular on inbound and reddit and and the truth is that it gives the average person an opportunity to ask successful people what's been working for them and essentially these questions are what will fuel their own success later on why do data driven pieces perform so well organically online and it's because you're providing new answers to questions that everybody has on their mind so the Content Marketing Institute is this marketing site they produce a lot of content as it's in the name and every year they produce this one report on the content marketing benchmarks budgets and trends and a couple of years ago this report that they put out was actually linked to over 7,000 times now if you're somebody who understands SEO you might understand that you need links in order to help your content to rank and you might also realize that it's actually difficult to get links organically and naturally so the fact that these guys managed to generate over 7,000 links to one piece of content is quite impressive especially since a lot of those links were coming from sites like Forbes Entrepreneur HubSpot Moz and a lot of very high domain sites so why were so many people rank linking to the site or linking to this piece of content and it's because they answered a question that literally every marketer had on their mind which was how does my content compared to the industry standards so this is an example of solving a burning problem now your goal as a business owner is to tap into some of the data that you have that might provide answers to your audience and solve some of these problems that they're that they've got or any of these questions that they're thinking about and present that data to them in a way that might be engaging for them and might inspire something within them so the next principle is to find hacks to common struggles is anyone familiar with this book the life-changing magic of tidying up yeah I bought this book I thought just buying it would make my house cleaner I ended up hiring a cleaner though that's too lazy I read half of it but the point is this book is very well known because it did go viral and the board actually provides a new approach to housecleaning right the goal is still essentially to declutter your home and live as more of a minimalist so what makes this book different from every other book on house cleaning or every other guide on house cleaning well it's because the solution is framed as a magical solution rather than something you actually have to work hard towards achieving which is a trap I clearly fell into purchasing this book and part of the reason is because the simple question that most people remember from this book is does this thing spark joy now the author mary condos states that if the answer to that question is yes or the answer if the answer to that question is no then you should get rid of the object now most books are guides that you find on housecleaning will typically tell you to get rid of something if you haven't used it in the past six months but Mary conda's actually repositioned this question as something a little bit deeper than utility joy right if we have to think back on the past six months to whether or not we've used something and let's say we have 30 outfits and you know we're going through our list of clothes and it's just like okay well this one reminds me of a traumatic experience I don't want to deal with this outfit anymore and by the third outfit you're like I'm do this anymore and next thing you know you've got sixteen new outfits that you can't get rid of and there's no space in your closet this is not something that's happened to me or anything but the point is that we know almost instantly if something makes us happy or not so by offering this simplified solution to completing a task it makes any struggle seem a lot easier to manage and now another way of looking at finding hats two common struggles is to look at do DIY YouTube videos and so has anyone seen this video about a guy folding a shirt in under two seconds okay now this video has over 15 million views and if you haven't seen it let me tell you about it it's actually just a guy folding a shirt and it takes in less than two seconds to do so now me being Who I am I thought you know let me test this out so I decided to tie myself folding a shirt and shocker it only took me about four seconds so why are 15 million people watching this video considering that it's really not that much of a struggle to fold a shirt and considering it only took me four seconds I don't know if I'm should i have fall under the world-class record of folding shirts and a specific amount of time but the point is it's not a big problem right but the reason so many people are watching this video is because he's identified a common toss that we're all familiar with and that we all do on a day-to-day basis but the main thing is he's actually structured and simplified that process to make it even easier than it already is so now something that you think is now he's structured in a way that makes you think oh this is actually a complicated task and he's simplified it when to begin with it was never that difficult and like at all so now think about some struggles or some tacit your audience is doing on a day-to-day basis something that they're very familiar with and is there a way that you can simplify that process even more and if you can do that then you've found a way to provide a hack to a common struggle so the third principle I want to share with you is the principle of busting a myth now let's assume that we have a theory which states that content which includes visuals and content without visuals performs equally well so your goal to bust a myth is to actually disprove this theory so one common example that I want to share with you is of an interactive infographic and an article that my colleague Ryan worked on now Ryan wanted to disprove the myth that Millennials are lazy and entitled so what he did is he dissected seven popular myths on the subject all backed up with credible data from credible resources and what ended up happening was the article performed very well and it actually got picked up by the next web which resulted in a whole new wave of traffic and comments and debate to our site and I believe now we actually rank longtail on the term old people suck go ahead google it now a common result of using the bust and math principle is that it does lead to a lot of debate right because you're questioning the strong belief that people have and I was as a result most companies try to shy away from creating this type of content because they're scared that it's going to make their audience mad but we've actually found that there's a lot more benefit than harm that comes from using this particular principle and that's that it actually leads to a lot more conversation which as a result leads to better SEO right the more people talking about your content the more people are linking to it and as a result a better brand recognition overall and stronger brand loyalty from the people who do actually agree with you funny enough this article was actually one of the most controversial pieces that we've done and we've done a lot of different controversial articles but I've never seen anyone so angry about an article before but it did get picked up by a lot and it actually sent a lot of traffic to the site it was just a weird thing and I know people are very passionate when you start talking about the fact that Millennials are not lazy and entitled all the old people come out from their hiding-places from the casinos in Las Vegas so the next principle is to challenge the status quo and this is somewhat similar to the busted myth principle but not identical and let me give you an example about that so garyvee is actually somebody who uses this a lot in his content and one popular article of his is entitled Super Bowl ads aren't expensive enough now if you're familiar with the Super Bowl you might be aware that in 2016 the average cost to run an ad on CBS was about five million dollars or a hundred and seventy thousand dollars a second now some ad networks charged as much as ten million dollars a minute for ad time so to make a claim that the Super Bowl is aren't expensive enough seems a bit ridiculous but his argument is that the Super Bowl is actually the one time during the year where people are actually excited to watch the ads and if you think about it we've been ingrained to believe that the ads are better than the game itself so typically we spend hundreds thousands of dollars not us but like bigger brands that have money I've spent hundreds and thousands of dollars fighting for people's attention so his argument is that the one time during the year where people are willingly giving up that attention the cost to get it is only a little bit higher than most big companies budgets so using this principle we decided to do our own piece that challenged the status quo and we decided to look at close to 200 tweets and looked at the hashtags on Twitter and we decided to state but hashtags are in fact useless in marketing now of course this goes this challenges the typical assumption that hashtags actually provide value in marketing and as you can imagine much like the myth-busting principle this does cause a lot of controversy and a lot of debate which makes sense right if you've been following a belief for your entire career only to be told that it's wrong and you've wasted your time naturally you're going to get upset about it but like the myth-busting approach this actually does get people talking about you and gets better brand recognition overall so the next one I want to cover is to reframe the question and the best example for this is to look at one from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation so what this organization was trying to do was that they were trying to get people to understand why malaria vaccination is important or why you should care about malaria vaccinations but rather than approaching it in a conventional way which might be to present the data and the death toll around malaria malaria death what they did is they instead created this infographic on the world's deadliest animals now when you take a closer look and you see that nearly 1 million deaths every year are caused by mosquito bites versus 10 deaths a year by shark attacks the data becomes a lot more surprising and memorable and as a result becomes a lot stickier so when you're using this principle you want to first identify what the main question is that you're trying to reframe in this case it is why is malaria vaccination important and approach it from a new angle so that people can see it with or cannot it with a different perspective I can give you guys an example so when I was starting out trying to get speaking gigs it wasn't easy because I didn't have any speaking experience as you might imagine so instead of just writing an open letter to the world saying you know what here's why I should be a speaker at your conference I actually decided to look at the diversity at different events and I analyzed about 15 different conferences and plotted down the female representation versus the male representation and this article actually ended up going viral within the online marketing space and as a result I actually got many speaking gates because of it so this is another example of reframing that question the exact goal of what you're trying to do is not obvious but it does work so the sixth principle I want to cover is to bring in a new perspective so what do I mean by this well a lot of content and a lot of marketers tend to tell stories from very conventional perspectives right we tend to stick to the obvious frameworks or principles that are given to us so let's say if we're writing an article about sports or basketball in the current form of Stephen Curry we typically stick to the general conventions or the normal perspectives for a common sports angle I mean like talk about the percentage of shots taken by Stephen Curry or we might talk about his performance compared to other players we might even comment on the fact that his 3-point game is statistically unlike any other players and the list goes on and on and on now there's close to hundreds of different articles and infographics and videos out there about Stephen Curry's 3-point game alone and there's nothing wrong with these stories are not bad stories but they're all the same and unless you somehow manage to get your piece covered by a channel like ESPN the truth is nobody's going to care because it's already been done so this is why it's important to to stand out and how do you stand out and that's done by bringing in a new perspective so here are a few examples of how you can do that so the first example looks at CEOs versus athletes and compares their traits this is still about sport but now we've bring like we're bringing in this new angle of entrepreneurship the second one looks at NBA valuation and revenue generated per team and the third one actually uses economics to analyze the cost per shot of various athletes so think about some common traits that you might use and try to move away from this traditional expected or expected perspective and try to explore topics through a different lens so unlike the previous principle which is to reframe the question we're not actually completely changing the angle we're just applying this new layer over it and that brings me into the seventh principle which is to mash up multiple topics and this is actually one of my favorite ones to use because it's pretty easy to do and it's a lot of fun to create this type of content so the mash-up principle is the idea of taking two seemingly unrelated topics and finding a common element that connects them and this is a great way of combining trending topics with evergreen ideas now since Venn gauge is a design tool our infographic design content is plenty so when the Star Wars movie The Force awakens came out rather than reading another article about infographic design we decided to look at the design trends that could be learned from Star Wars so design which is an evergreen topic for us and Star Wars which is a trending topic at the time resulted in the perfect piece of content which actually ended up getting picked up by Fast Company and which went viral on 9gag another example is was done by this analytics company that approached us and in order to highlight their tool and the type of data it collected they wanted to create an infographic which analyzed the language that was used on Twitter by various presidential candidates and this was a way for them to demonstrate what their tools capabilities were and as a result this infographic got picked up by ad week because it was done on a timely in a timely manner during the elections or this was just before this is as the elections were beginning before a certain candidate entered the running so what are some possible trending topics that you can tap into that and combine an element of your or part of your product to it whether it's comparing Lord of the Rings to your SEO strategy or Harry Potter to your company culture by using this mashup principle you're actually able to attract a much wider audience so the eighth principle that we'll cover is to go outside of your immediate field so I'm gonna use HubSpot as an example are you guys all familiar with HubSpot I can't see anything so I'm just gonna assume you are and the reason I'm assuming most of you are familiar with HubSpot is because they've positioned themselves as this hub for everything sales and even marketing or sales and marketing related but the primary tool is a CRM but just because their tool is the CRM doesn't mean that all of their content needs to be about using a CRM they actually branch out into a variety of topics from SEO to content marketing to entrepreneurship to advertising and as a result they're now known as this go-to resource for all marketing knowledge so try not to focus solely on your immediate field and try to venture outside of that tiny little bubble and find areas that fall outside of that realm and how you can tie them back to your product and I feel like a lot of people try to avoid doing this because they don't think that it's going to result in direct conversions or easy to measure ROI but the truth is people I go to HubSpot don't go there to buy the CRM but that's kind of what happens later on and it creates this brand awareness where down the line when maybe they do need a serum or when somebody else they know might need a CRM they can redirect them back to that company so the next principle is to actually find niches and subcultures to comment on so for anyone who wasn't aware I'm from Toronto I tried to make that obvious with the Drake and the hat that I'm wearing nobody got it you guys didn't get it did you but the point is in Toronto we have this online Facebook group called buns &amp; buns is essentially like a trading post on Facebook and in the matter of a few years this trading zone online has actually become quite massive and it's exceeded thousands and thousands of people and there's actually multiple subgroups that branch off of the main buns group so there's the buns home zone there's the buns pet zone there's the buns dating zone yeah that's the thing there's even the buns mental Health's own but there's also a buns dank meme zone now for any of one that's not familiar with what a dank meme is it's just a really hilarious meme and if you're looking for meme recommendations please find me after and I'll share some great accounts with you guys that's what's talking about this particular group is that in just the span of a couple of months it went from one girl who invited a few friends into a group to share some memes to a group of over 3,000 people that actually spanned across Canada not just Toronto but what's even more fascinating is that this group has actually been written about in The Huffington Post in XO Jane and a few other different publications now why are so many people willing to feature stories about you know a group of individuals just sharing funny memes with each other why is reddit such a popular site and the truth is that people tend to become very obsessive about subcultures almost to the point where it becomes cultish so using this principle we decided to create a map of all the betrayals that happen in the game of Thrones and this was a fun little toss for us what we did is we actually went through the Wikipedia's of every single season and mapped out all of the betrayals that happened which was very exciting for a design team but what ended up happening was a company or a publication called distract off' I picked up our piece and actually featured it but that what happened was George Takei shared that article which resulted in our site crashing from too much traffic don't worry we've upgraded our server since then but the thing is subcultures tend to grow very quickly and if you think about it Game of Thrones has been around since the early 90s right the books have been written for a while but only recently had it has it gained its traction RuPaul's Drag Race is another show that I really like and it's about drag queens and when I first looked at the subreddit which was a couple years ago the RuPaul's Drag Race subreddit had about 60,000 active members and that's almost as many people as the marketing subreddit at the time but in the past 24 hours the top upvoted post on RuPaul's Drag Race had 600 up votes and the marketing subreddit would still had more people in it only had 109 up votes so I actually decided to take another look at the subreddit just a few days ago and what's interesting is now the RuPaul's Drag Race subreddit has a hundred and sixty thousand active members and the marketing separate it has about a hundred and nine thousand active members but even more shocking is that the top up voted posts in the RuPaul subreddit is thirty-eight thousand versus seven hundred and forty five and the fact is that subcultures really engage people generalize topics do but not nearly to the same extent so the next principle were almost at the end to bear with me is to explore and visualize origin stories so for every topic there is an origin story of how that thing came to be you could be talking about coconut oil and there is an origin story of how coconut oil became such a trending topic now is anyone here familiar with the Netflix Marvel series I feel like this is the perfect audience for Netflix Marvel series you seem very enthusiastic Rob well there's always a ton of hype around the launch of a new Marvel series on Netflix and in fact according to Business Insider of the top 10 most viewed original shows on Netflix three of them which is daredevil Jessica Jones and Luke Cage fall within the top most viewed shows and there's a lot of original content on Netflix so this is a pretty big factor in fact superhero movies in general are some of the highest grossing films in Hollywood and in 2016 of the top 10 highest grossing movies in Hollywood four of them were superhero movies now I know what you're thinking you mean you need to start creating some superhero content for your site no that's not what I'm saying you don't need to create articles or content or info ethics about people getting bitten by spiders and developing fantastic abilities about from using your product but you can't actually comment and investigate on the origin stories of specific fields of interests of industries and companies and of influential people and if you think about it we've all heard of the stories of people like Steve Jobs and Richard Branson building themselves up from these tiny garage workshops and these are the ones that engage us and that inspire us to do great things so what types of origin stories can you tell and one of the most common ways of depicting origin stories in content marketing is through these of timelines so here are a couple examples that I like that stand out to me a lot so the one at the this side right here is the history of Google i/o so we actually put this together during the i/o conference and we just created a timeline of everything that happened and because it was on trend and because it told this history of Google a lot of different sites picked it up including Business Insider the one in the middle is a very popular one by this designer called ANOVA tall and she actually has a Pinterest account and if you look at her account every single one of these posts has over 50,000 shares and she actually has tons of different infographics that are just timelines and origin stories of these successful entrepreneurs so when you're looking to use this principle try to think of aspects within your own industry that have a fascinating story that you can tell a history that you can share with your audience and if you can identify those and actually tell that story because it might not be directly related to your company but it will engage people and get them to find your product and to find your website now the next principle is all about envisioning the before and after state of your users so for every product or every company we have a before state which is your user before they find your product and an after state which is them once they have found your product so your goal is to help your customer achieve that after state so before the before and after state is broken down into four primary categories what your customer has what they feel the day in their life and their overall status so let's look at an example and I'll use the example of baby bathtubs you know those like small squishy tubs that you put in the sink I guess I don't know I don't know how babies work I think that's what they do anyway so the before and after state is that we're probably marketing to the parent most likely the mother and before the mother has this cold hard tub and afterwards she has this warm squishy tub for her sink before of course she feels scared and frustrated because you know she's gonna drop her baby into the big tub because babies are slippery or something right I don't know but afterwards she feels confident and in control because her baby is secure in the squishy tub before bath time is terrible again she's scared of dropping her baby but afterwards bottom becomes a breeze because the baby's not gonna fall out of the small squishy tub and of course before she feels unappreciated because her babies like why you keep dropping me in this big tub and then afterwards she's the supermom because the babies like yo you did it you got me into the tub I didn't fall out this is what I assume it's like to have children it's just this constant struggle if will I drop it clearly I don't have any kids if I did that would be a problem but the point is that you want to look at the before and after state and create the situation for for your user so when you're working when you're working on your own content try to use this checklist when speaking to your audience tell them what they have now versus what they'll have later tell them how they feel now versus how they'll feel later and so on and so forth and if you're interested in learning more about this concept there's a really great article by a digital marketer on customer value optimization which I recommend checking out and I will be giving a link to the slide deck after this so the link will be in that slide deck and finally the last principle seems like a given in most situations and that is include a reason to share but I think a lot of people forget what that really means and it doesn't mean asking your audience to just please share this post on Twitter at the end of an email it means really asking yourself why should I share this and will this help somebody better express themselves so why is it that everything that the Trump administration does seems to go viral why are so many people even those that typically don't follow politics getting so riled up about this particular president now without going into too much unnecessary detail it comes down to one thing which is emotion most of the things that Trump says are either either completely approved of and loved or completely abhorred and detested there really isn't like a happy medium but because of this passionate love and hate people are becoming inspired to act in order to have their voices heard and what happens is when Trump makes a claim like something like his travel ban on Muslims or the fact that climate change doesn't exist the people that agree with him tend to express themselves in that way and the people that are against him tend to lash out and then it becomes this ongoing cycle where everyone's retaliating against each other so when people care about something what they do is they act in response to that care and they speak out in response to that care now it might not be as easy to get somebody emotional about let's say a social analytics company but what people do get emotional about are the stories of other people so founder magazine is a company that really taps into this well and they actually sell a course on to teach people how to grow their Instagram followings but instead of just telling people to buy this course they actually share the success stories of their audience or people that have completed the course and what ends up happening is that business businesses or entrepreneurs that have found success share those stories with their audience and then people from their audience who are inspired and motivated end up taking up the course and sharing their own successes once they've completed it as well so it continues a cycle in that way so does your company have any of these great success stories that are the result of your product and can you share those stories with your audience in order to strike this emotional chord so here's a quick recap of all of the 12 principles that we've gone through in case anyone wants to take a picture sorry I did he doesn't want me to go back you were like in the middle you were like I got my camera ready and then I was like nevermind just kidding now go back just kidding oh sorry did we trying to take a picture no go ahead go ahead I won't do it again okay he's like face makes me along the point is remember that setting limitations for yourselves is actually a really great way to fuel your own creativity and to come up with these engaging stories that will in turn inspire and motivate your audience and get them to become more passionate about your brand so before I go I understand that for many of you it's probably harder to create this content because you might not have the budget you might not have the team so one thing that we're working on is we're working on a new product but in order to collect some data we've decided to create free infographics and exchange not a sales pitch I promise you you will get an email from me but it'll be like can you fill out this form so I can create an infographic for you so if you're interested in that I won't go into too much detail but you can find me later and we can talk but you can just follow this link you can get a free design and you'll also get the slide decks by following this link this is you can take a picture of this I won't I don't want such the slide I promise go ahead I'm waiting in the mean time does anyone have any questions thanks all right we have time for a couple questions did you get the picture okay I'm really happy okay you've created some really cool infographics using some very popular IP has there ever been any pushback from JK rowling Disney etc about like you sort of leveraging their super popular thing and their names and their pictures um no and if you look online there's so much fanfiction and so much fan created content about these big brands they're way too big they don't care enough and all we're doing is we're sorting people into like houses based on their company culture or creating a map to help users actually watch Game of Thrones better so we've never had any issues the only the only area that you actually do you might find a problem is if you're using that content in advertising and you might like use Oprah Winfrey's face as an advertisement to state that Oprah approves of your product and that's an area of concern but if you're just using the brand and using it as like a trending topic I don't think we've we've never had any issues any other questions yeah we have well aside from like the Google IO thing we've created content around our own tools capabilities as well kind of like I was talking about the social the example I gave about the Twitter analysis data that tool was a very social analytics tool and it wasn't when they approached me I was like I don't get what you guys are doing and they just provided me with the data and then we created we pulled in another topic that we could leverage to make it more interesting but the thing is like any trending topic somebody else is asking me about this we're right now for instance I've been engaged we're working on creating these like roadmap templates which aren't that exciting but one thing that we might be able to do is like create a road map for Jessica Jones on finding killgrave like that's one way to just pull in that trending topic that makes sense hey the the quality of the kind of traffic that you get is that something that you kind of target because obviously like if you're in a specific space on the issue industry you know you want kind of quality leads and that stuff coming in it seems like you know if you kind of go really wide and you're going Jessica Jones or whatever you're gonna get a bunch of randoms coming in is the philosophy sort of you know you'll cast a big net and you'll get quality kind of out of it or do you do anything specifically in your strategy to try and you know pick up the subculture or whatever that's gonna be yes associated with you industry or whatever so our goal we have a few different goals but when it comes to traffic the viral concepts that we're creating is actually to get PR mentions and as a result by getting high authority sites mentioning us we can increase our own brand visibility our own domain Authority which in turn helps push up all of our other content but for instance with the Game of Thrones piece we got a hundred thousand views in the span of two days none of those people converted but we saw an overall trend of like uplift across the site and that's because Google was seeing all of this traffic coming to our site and it helps give us more visibility online and like I said it's brand awareness right if you if you have more content out there and more people talking about you and knowing about you they'll be more likely to remember you and they actually do need to use something like you
