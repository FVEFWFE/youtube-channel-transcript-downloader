================================================================================

[Music] this is my fourth time I might become third time speaking which is always exciting and cool way back when I did the first talk in micro confu is my first talk ever when Rob invited me I was super scared obviously I'm still scared every time but more scared than usual and I gave what I consider to be a very tactical sort of talk and I've sort of not given that many tactical talks but we're gonna get right back to kind of the original stuff that I love talking about which is the actual words on the page when you're writing copy for your landing pages website onboarding emails all your emails everything there's so much to know but ultimately it comes down to the words you actually put on the page the word choices that you make so I'm talking to you today about money words we have to call it I mean money words sounds like kind of dumb right but these are words that perform really well again and again so we produce a lot of I think we're still good we produce a lot of coffee over many many years lots and lots of it and so we went back through and did a sort of audit of our highest performing copy and we looked at are not as high performing copy two and identify some of the words that recur again and again so when you're thinking of writing copy for your business or when you're reviewing copy that someone else writes for your business you're gonna be looking obviously at the words and I want to give you some ideas some food for thought for when you're actually putting the words on the page and choosing what to eliminate versus what to keep so these are like high ROI words and phrases that we use all the time so what kinds of ROI are we talking about so just to give you some background because normally when I talk I walk you through like case studies like here's what we did here's what happened here's what the results were when we tested it or whatever so I'm not gonna walk you through exact case studies like that but I want to give you some background because micro competencies are naturally skeptical which I love and so I want to walk you through like so you're like okay where is this coming from Joanna like it's one thing that you're on stage but what do you guys actually doing so we work with a lot of tech companies in particular but also some oddballs like sports and entertainment which is always shocking because I can't tell like a baseball from a football but it's neat to be invited to help with that but we work with companies like sprout social Prezi canva Wistia we've done something with a couple years back now actually and Shopify again more recently companies beyond that - those are just some pretty cool ones to mention examples of ROI I've talked about this a lot of thing he talked about this two years ago micro comm 3.5 times the paid conversions with these eight emails that we rewrote for Wistia so nearly 20% drop in turn four emails that we rewrote or wrote for canva don't worry wrote for canva for work and that might not sound like a lot but that's a really big like scale like there's a lot of signups going on there and impacting turn like that was pretty powerful and then outside of the tech world we also I mean copy hackers is an online training business actually so we work with a lot of people in online training and there's this woman named Amy Porterfield who has a really badass training business and this the technique some of the stuff we're going to talk about today we're part of this 3,000 students being enrolled in a 2,000 dollar course so you can do the math pretty easily on that one and that happened in a very short window so lots of stuff again this is more copy hacker stuff so we did a half a million dollar five-day launch with these techniques we're in the middle of another one that's doubling that right now sales page course that we did you know 150 in about 60 hours with three emails in one sales page and nothing else around it and of course you have to have like a platform and other things things like that but once you've already got people coming to you how do you get them to actually convert and with this is our 10x freelance copywriter where it's our monthly recurring revenue so so yeah so we're doing what I'm going to show you is part of writing copy for these high converting campaigns focusing on money words focusing on word choice has anybody heard of a word that you believe is a high converting word give any examples like when I say ooh it's like a magic word Bree closing soon brainy rides safe best somebody heard of what did you say buy it now okay you heard this one because so I'm not gonna talk about because today because um it's one of the possibly more common ones out there if you've read she'll Dinis influence anyway for the marketers in the room it's not that it's a bad word it's a good word but we haven't tested anything with it it doesn't come up often in the copy that we write so I'm not going to stand up here and teach you anything that has anything to do with what I don't know only things that have been working for us and because is not one of them so seven of them are quite different from that now I know we just got back from lunch and so people are like oh speaking after lunch is the worst cuz you're in a food coma but I always really like it because you're not thinking about food you're done thinking about food and my mind always thinks so I want to quiz you because why not right you're a captive audience and I'm on stage I get to choose just kidding pop quiz then for a word choice okay put yourself in it's time for you to write copy or to review copy for your business what do you do if you have a big objection to overcome so you know that your reader has an objection you have to overcome it can you think of any copywriting technique you know maybe one that I've mentioned or spoke about first in my very first micro comp talk anything that you should prioritize in your copy you have a big objection to overcome acknowledging the objection with any thing in particular you don't have to have the answer okay so there are some things floating around but by and large we're not that sure right and that could just be because you're like Jeff I just sat down like calm down like I know I might be sure later give me a chat so we're gonna walk through this stuff but another question if you had particularly jumpy customers like people who are like a anything that could make them feel they're deciding logically not emotionally what's a word you might use it's a phrase you might use validator okay couple ideas no one feels that confident okay we're gonna get you there if you're struggling to keep people reading down the page or down the email we often all default to oh nobody reads let's just make it short that's the easiest way to avoid this problem that they're not reading this is like pull the words off the page any way that you can use copy use actual word choice to keep them moving down the page anything come to mind puberty what did I hear like maybe we'll try that well test that one nice and see what happens okay we're gonna we're gonna get to all of that before the end of the session you're gonna have answers to that and hopefully you will feel confident with those going forward let's get into the very first money word can we think of a word just a word that you use when you're writing or that you've heard us talk about before or something like that that works repeatedly money we're gonna free and money where are you it's Frank Kern teaching you guys how to write copy like no offense summers like was Frank Kern don't look him up okay so we're gonna get into the money word number one but first before we do which of these I'm gonna give you a couple examples which of these makes it feel like the outcome or benefit is more within reach for you okay so our job is to make sure that people who are reading or copy actually believe it in some cases just by them actually thinking like oh yeah that could happen that that's that's for me okay two options here you can feel free to not show doubt if you're like I don't like your quizzes or you can you could win a million dollars or you should win a million dollars which one feels more Within Reach be let's try again hey okay you could file your taxes without worrying where you should file your taxes without worrying you could be as famous as Kim Kardashian or you should be as famous as Kim Kardashian should is the winner so why though what are we talking about what's really going on with the word should so when we're talking about could we're talking about aspiration you could win a million dollars you could win the lottery and a lot of people buy into that right and but most of us aren't selling lottery outcomes we're not selling this big huge goal but we still try to make our copy really ambitious we're trying to set goals that are huge for people like if Weight Watchers tried to sell you on going from 300 pounds to 120 pounds that's really aspirational but how Within Reach does that feel you could lose 180 pounds versus you should lose 180 pounds so when we're talking to people in ways that feel more one-on-one like on our websites in our landing pages in our emails absolutely we suspend this idea of aspiration just throw it don't worry about aspiration when you're writing copy an unrealized destiny regret and the restoration of justice can feel far more human which is what's really going on with the word should aspiration is good right you could get something amazing out of this no I was telling Josh Kaufman I have all of these now that I'm like 40 I can't see anything anymore so that's fun look forward to that but I have a whole bunch of little examples here I'm gonna read out to you I just have to get em up the first one here okay example of should in practice you can't maybe you can read this possibly not okay this is an email that we sent that monthly recurring revenue that 30 mr that we have for the 10x freelance copywriter membership site this was an email in that so it goes goodness storm right out of the gates and say it if you're a freelance copywriter who still hasn't hit the levels of revenue respect and real badassness the gig should entail you need to hang with me on this webinar today we're gonna skip all the career fair stuff and dive straight into the biggest mistakes that are straight jacketing your freelance biz reducing what should be a lucrative and predictable six-figure affair into and so on so not what could be but what should be and what's really going on here this is like if somebody's seen the movie The Shawshank Redemption they may not seen the movie The Shawshank Redemption you have to leave like I don't know who you are I can't talk to you anymore um so what was going on in that movie we watch it so my house who's seen it more than once yeah so a lot of us how so of us you haven't it was too heart-wrenching to get through a second time what was going on so this guy this seemingly perfectly normal human being loses everything goes through the most traumatizing horrible experience for like 20 years of his life and ends up spoiler alert but you don't deserve to hear anyway if you haven't seen it no I'm just kidding but spoiler alert at the end he has to climb through two football fields lengths of raw sewage to get to his life on the other side of the walls like that is not aspirational it wasn't some guy who didn't deserve to get out who could live on the other side of the walls it was someone who should be on the other side of those walls so when you're going through and this is just a quick check for you to do when you're writing copy if you see can or could in your copy try replacing it with see if you can tap into that and really connect with what people are actually feeling on like a personal level level not incredible amounts of aspiration but like restoring an injustice in their lives like they're doing the work they're doing X or Y or Z they graduated from university they should be X there's so many things that we're already doing in life um and you're just trying to correct that injustice should is money we're number one money we're number two okay copy school that's Co we're in the or at the very end of this launch right now this one word and a variation of it makes up 5% of the copy on a page filled with 10,000 words any idea guys well done hey I'm gonna pretend I talked to you that but you just guessed didn't say anything yes you or variation of it 517 out of nearly 10,000 words are you or you're now this is something to talk about quite a bit a really good trick that I recommend that you follow is to rear a every line of your copy with the word you at the start so look on your website look in your emails and if you have a copywriter who's doing this for you or somebody on your team acting like a copywriter go through and the exercise is rewrite every single sentence don't think about it just do it rewrite every sentence with you as the subject you or your that's it and I guarantee if you go to your site you'll be like wow none of these start with you so it was gonna be like a really good exercise so I randomly was like okay I have to find an example for this so I went to drift because I was on their site anyway because we use drift and I was there for another reason so I went to their homepage I think it was and just grabbed and this is like because this is everywhere you can see it everywhere so it's a really easy one for most of us to fix this is what they have I'll read it for you this is conversations not for it was okay with drift on your website any conversation can be a conversion instead of traditional marketing and sales platforms that rely on forums and follow-ups drift connects your business with the best leads in real time now like us like readers of the site we can look at them go like yeah that's that's perfectly fine copy like that sounds good I'd be happy if my site sounded like that it's short so people are all like happy with that but if we rewrite it can we make it sound while keeping the message exactly the same can we make it sound more like it's actually about your prospect so they can see themselves on the page in ways that maybe they kind of can't right so this is us just rewriting it not testing it this is how you would do it so the headline that cross hadn't stopped stay the same we're just working on the body copy your team can turn any conversation into conversion with drift on your website you'll get the best leads in real time in ways you simply count with traditional marketing and sales platforms so now we're fully talking you and now when a person comes to the page what do people care about do they care about you maybe they care about themselves possibly a little more probably a lot more than they care about you possibly entirely more than they care about you they don't have any interest in you whatsoever you're the worst no you're not the worst but they don't care right so they care about themselves and the rare exception is those who care about you more than themselves or at least as much and that's like Apple fanboys and stuff like that where you don't even have to write copy to begin let's don't even worry about like solving for those people we want to begin with you and your things like that were ever possible making that the subject so we did this in our coffee school launch I won't read it all out but the sentence a couple sentences here are you don't have time to play a poor man's game of copywriting chicken with the blinking cursor your CMO your client your employees they can't wait until you feel inspired enough to write the copy that keeps everyone including the company's Bernese burmese dog fed that's just beginning with you right and that's a really straightforward easy thing for you to do right away and then the more you do this the more you will just start naturally being the focus of the coffee that you write so you won't always have to go through and manually insert you in order to actually express that this is for your reader and it's not about you it's about them going forward you'll get into more natural things where like this entire block which you don't have to read this whole block is all about you but at no point does it actually lead with the word you it'll just start coming more naturally but importantly this seems to be like a filter for us when we're writing copy or reviewing copy other people write for you definitely doing that is you the subject is though is you the subject now you can say I and if you have at all for some reason read direct response copywriting type stuff you'll probably know that a lot of old-school copywriting always led with I was very story based leading with I I would argue that those days are kind of over you can say I you can talk about your product but only after you've talked about them first repeatedly so for the copywriter mastermind we lead with you in the copy we're talking about you you you you you then we do a quick transition and only then we talk about ourselves only once you've earned the right and said like yeah I know this is about you this matters more to you everything here should be about you only then are you okay to switch into talking about your product and this is even true on your about page and your contact page in case you're like that's not true for those nope it's true everywhere and this is just the you rule really straightforward thing easy for you to keep and start using in your own copywriting now that's where if you wanted to get this you could but don't worry about it money word number three case we've got should instead of could we have you wherever possible money we're number three is to that worked together actually still and already now what's going on here is pretty similar to what was going on with the should word to begin with this idea that you've put in all of this work you've already done X and still why isn't happening you've already gone through X and still why isn't happening so we use this all over the place quick little examples here they'll read off for these so you know about them in context so which means this is an email that we did for copy school two years ago so the copy reads which means you'll still struggle the next time you're supposed to produce a high converting email campaign you'll still think of copywriting is something you guess at and as a consequence you'll you still actually guess at it you'll still live in a world where you never ever get that feeling that comes to publishing new copy so still just getting into write still you're already you're doing that you're still going to get this effect even though you're doing some sorts of work and then over on the other side you already know that a 10x freelance copywriter career won't happen so what are the things that are already going on for your prospect that they already know that they're already doing and they're not getting the results that they expected if you can join them in that moment and talk through that with them that's gonna be really powerful for them because it's true to them it's not just putting the word you on the page like we just did in the last one it's actually going back to like what you're going through so the more you know about your prospect and I know that some of the speakers are the attendee talks today are covering stuff here so there's more to come on that but the more you know about that person who's reading your copy the more you can actually tap into things like you're already doing this and still you're not getting that so we use it all over the place already what's going on here is already is the word that signals like these are signals this is word choice it's intentional word choice it signals a step taken which ought to put the reader ahead so what's the thing that your prospect has done where they should have gotten ahead because of it if you're talking to like new grads they graduated they put in the work there should be something good on the other side of that and then still signals a lack of progression in spite of the step taken so this is all part of something called exclusive empowerment which you can use if you want to nerd out on it and that's just like what exclusive what what empowers your prospect in ways that other people are not empowered so what's actually going on for those people who turn into paying customers for you what was happening for them immediately before they signed up to learn from you or to choose your product or whatever that might be now these appear all over our long-form sales pages and they always generally always appear together or in close proximity so here is another one this is from the digital course note this is from a different one for Amy Porterfield to sign up at the top here this is the beginning of a long form of sales page so the goal is definitely like pull people in important question for coaches experts chorus creators and online business owners who still don't have a profitable email list of twenty five hundred engaged ready to buy subscribers so can you see a little bit how that word still is starting to bring people in and match this this idea that they have like this goal that they had but they're still not getting the results and it puts them in a place of like feeling their pain without having to poke too hard at their pain they're put back in that moment your job is to get them there this is also all over all sorts of sales emails that we write I just gave this as an example and these all do work together still already and should work really well together and then we have these here as well for Amy Porterfield the emails that brought in that essentially a six million dollars in a week you're already sold on creating digital courses you just haven't found the right guidance implementation plans or accountability to confidently greenlight the project you've already been investing time energy and money in building your digital courses course but have suffered from momentum crushing missteps and misfires more than any entrepreneur can reasonably reasonably Endora so again this is like this is the kind of stuff that might feel like why would we do this when you invest in doing this when you try to do this stuff when you like look at copy as so much more about a conversation what's really going on with people than just you know Rando words keep it short bold stuff etc etc you can get more inside their heads and so again this is all over the place everywhere now what's going on here what copywriters know is that even nuanced moments of VIP penis are really important for getting people to say yes to you so again that's tapping into what your prospect has already gone through poking at it saying like look you already did this you should be getting this result but you're not getting into that can help bring them into the conversation okay now this is a really tactical one because that was kind of like up in the air sort of thing the next one is here's the thing does anybody use this or a variation of it in your copy some of us do right yeah so I use it I use it all the time any paragraph that I have that starts to feel a bit long I just throw in here's the thing or the tricky thing is or things like that make it its own line and people pay more attention to it I'm gonna talk through why that is here's an example okay so this is just a news levin vut a Shinto come to one of our live events sorry live online events so sideways sales pages are the pages that are responsible for some of the biggest launches in the last 10 years we hit our first half million dollar launch and we added an SSP door at launch process and marketers like Jeff Walker completely swear by them but the tricky thing is this how do you actually script the videos that go on those pages now what's going on in that moment that but that but the tricky thing is this or the here's the thing moment you're breaking up a deal with someone actually answering that I saw hand gulp that's a cool takeover but you're breaking up this flow this like people are just stuck in it and reading like okay paying attention but now you're drawing attention to something and the thing that you're actually drawing attention to you the but here's the thing is a really kind of an empty right it's not saying anything but it's setting up what comes next and that's where you want the part that's most important to follow what comes right after that and that's something called the bucket brigade has anybody heard of this no okay well this is good you guys are gonna have so much to walk away with okay so the bucket brigade idea goes way back to like fireman putting out fires as groups way back in let's say the 1800s I don't know when back before there were fire hydrants and hoses I guess so they would stand in a lineup with all the water over here fire over there men would stand here in these lineups and they'd have buckets right I think we've seen one like Bugs Bunny or the Flintstones or something like this this idea and they've moved the water through that what's called the bucket brigade to put out the fire and just keep putting it through but it's like this idea of moving something moving a piece of information further down the line so you have to kind of keep following it so but here's the thing gets you in there other things are things simple as first things first with a colon after it then a line break second things second colon after it line break especially when you're writing emails I know I know because I've heard it for 15 years that you want to keep your emails short you want to keep your landing pages short try not keeping them short and try actually using some of these techniques to pull the reader along so they keep paying attention even when you're like no people don't read this is how they keep reading you add in things like that this is not it you do not just want to say here's a whole bunch of here's some bullets click on one of them that's not what we're talking about so what's happening here is this idea of getting people to stick with you no matter how much you're telling them so obviously we want to be interesting at all times but sometimes we need to use more words than we feel comfortable with especially when you're reviewing copy as a team and everyone's like oh no one reads online you're like oh I don't want to die people do you read online they don't read boring things and they can read more if you help them along so we talked about like scannable coffee a lot scannable coffee isn't about you know bolding the most important thing on the page or using bullets that's not this you're not trying to write copy for people who don't have time for you that's not gonna work out you have such better opportunities for people who do have time for you to actually speak with them and connect with them so instead of bolding the thing in the middle of the page that you think is an important thing you don't want someone to miss if you bold the things that come directly before the thing you want people to pay attention to then they're more likely as I'm scanning down the page and I see but here's the thing bolded there now I'm like oh what's the thing and I'm reading it that's what we need to do with our emails not just let people walk away without reading anything but give them a reason to keep reading it and we do that all over the place here again that's another example okay we're getting down to the final ones in our money words so far we have should you what else already instill and we just did here's the thing I like okay I think I would have done well in like teaching grade three except for the kids okay money word number five the truth is the fact is okay this is a good one it's like bucket brigade just like that but it's signaling something way cooler it's not as empty as the here's the thing so on the digital course Academy page again that I mentioned already with Amy Porterfield this truth or fact was used six times on that page alone and we used it all over our coffee school we use it all the time here is an example I'll just point these out for you so you can have a look at them here's the let me just go close right I can't see it because I'm old here's the thing here's the thing the truth is the fact is all of these again and again right we're seeing it all over the place the truth is : the fact is : those sorts of things again you're tapping into something like logic so people want to believe that they're making logical decisions we all know this we know that they're making it emotionally and we know that we have to make them feel like this is a logical thing word choice can do that simply saying the fact is or the truth is seeing that word is a lot like that magic word because because it's also a signal of logic like I want to do this because we believe that everything that follows the word because it's going to be like oh there's a logical reason for this same with the truth is and the fact is now obviously it's about tone too so if you're like the truth is all the time and you sound like a little know-it-all and that's probably not gonna go that well but if you use it sometimes when you know that people are like mmm and they're feeling something and they want to be pulled out of that feeling for a moment so that they actually tell themselves this is a logical decision I'm making this is what we want to do obviously we need to tell ourselves that we are basing our decisions on Logic cool that brings us to this is one that I spoke about at microcon from the very first talk afterward Heaton Shah wanted to work with me after that so I feel like this is the money where just because Heaton was like hey let's work together so I'm like I'll always talk about even if but even if so has anybody used even if in their copy ok this is one of those back in the back of the room of course this is one of those classic go-to so that's going to like really immediately impact your copy just like the you rule well if you got our book that we put out years ago that Rob mentioned we're stellar messages come from just in writing the book alone and knowing that people reading it we had to overcome their objections to we have even if throughout that and it was on 10x emails on our sales page where it reads even if you've never sent an email before you're terrified of unsubscribes your list is microscopic etc etc so even if is the beginning of this whole objection handling experience right so the persuasion technique here is simply objection handling here is how you make it work in your copy you take the benefit or the outcome that you want people to believe the benefit that you're selling them on the advantage depends how you look at it but the event the benefit or the outcome then you add the word even if and then you put the objection that's that's it so you take the benefit even if objection it's so brutally simple if you apply it to your cross heads on almost any page and you'll think oh people will notice I'm reusing this don't worry about it just start by doing that so an example is immediately boost your copies persuasive power let's say if that was my benefit for you you're going to immediately boost your copies persuasive power even if you've never written a line of copy and we could keep subbing in different objections and subbing in different benefits too and you can do that all over your page and it very quickly becomes this this absolute signal that you know leads to objections being far better handled than if you just kind of avoid them obviously importantly here is you want to make sure you're doing this without like introducing the objection so the more you know about where your customer is in their customer journey the better that will work but again don't overthink it just start using it money word number seven we're already there you're like Joanna its copywriting it's good for you it's not an already thing for me okay money word number seven is what any idea what fills this in ever word your prospect keeps using that's what we want to sub in there and we need to learn what that is of course this is just word mirrors so originally I wanted to give a whole talk on word mirrors alone on this idea that this bigger kind of idea that you need to reflect your prospect on your page so well that they can actually see themselves where they are and where they're going to be next not they're huge aspirational self but where they're gonna be next so that's our job as copywriters and growth marketers that's what we're trying to do create these word mirrors okay here's how we did it so this is something that you can apply really quickly just anybody use Thank You pages for like sign ups couples it may not use a thank you page somewhere most of us have Thank You pages what are you doing with your thank-you pages what goes on them there's a real question so I can have water what goes on the next call-to-action awesome good that's rare but yes good anything else do you know what's on your thank-you page thank you bye II like what now a gift the rabbit with the pancake on his head I think we once had one like that cuz we thought it was funny and then we realized it was a tragic waste of space anybody else yeah thank you page yeah we'll talk okay so thank you page after a person does something and you think them what more can you do on that page so for copy school immediately after a customer purchase copy school 2018 this was last year we had a thank you page on that page we actually decided to use it and we asked him this question type four of embedded easily on this was a leadpages landing page as well what was going on in your life that brought you to join coffee school today this is the question when I was back had conversion rate experts this one was one that we rolled out to everybody and I was part of making that survey I was like the lead on making that survey and we rolled it out used it across client after client gigantic clients it opens your eyes because it's gonna be open-ended as well people have to answer that question so the question is what was going on in your life that brought you to blank today brought you to sign up for our webinar today brought you to want to change your project management software today that brought you to X today what's the thing that you want to ask them about what did they just do now you want to find out why because then you can join the conversation happening in the heads of people who are also like they are of course right that's what we do so we ask that question and we got I mean we talked to copywriters so we got some like obnoxious things like the answer one of them was groping in the dark of an educated purgatory destined to be chained to low wages and toxic work environments yet unwilling to surrender to the perils of loserdom which like made my day kind of in reading and like thank you for that Bree some of them are gonna be far more useful than that and you'll see actual like words and synonyms for them repeating throughout so we saw the same kind of word repeating again and again it was confidence or a version of confidence a word like confidence we saw it so much in these responses and there were hundreds and hundreds of responses here we saw it so much that we were like okay that's that's got to be a money word so we added it in to the remaining emails for our launch for copy school and that was of course we've got confidence as our money word and now let me use my iPhone if I can so that led to of course that's writing this email and we add this whole section in here in this entire section I'm just gonna zoom in and show you up close the entire section is just selling confidence that's it we use the word confidence we use variations of the word confidence again and again in this and of course we would because that's what people were saying they were signing up to get they wanted confidence will give you a confidence so we used it all over the place here knowing that that's actually what they are getting out of it too they weren't saying they wanted one thing we were like oh damn I wish we had that like they actually they could get that out of it in the end so the most convincing copy as we all know it's not waiting in a list of money words those are all gonna be good you was gonna be good again and again still and already and should those are gonna be good but the real words of course that are actually going to move the needle are the ones that are actually waiting in your customers heads your current your ex all of that stuff and we know that but are you doing it are you going in and looking for the words and then taking exactly what they say and putting it on the page that's our objective so now that you know I'm gonna quiz you again if you have a big objection to overcome and the idea what technique you should try and your copy okay even if okay if you have particularly jumpy customers any idea what phrase you should use to make them feel they're deciding logically not emotionally truth is fact is if you're struggling to keep people reading down the page and the idea what you should do in your copy use them all together for maximum ROI and then tell me how it goes thanks guys Jenna thank you for a great talk I heard you speak about 18 months ago and where the premise of your talk was to talk in the customers voice but although everything you've been talking about today has been talking in our own voice right we're seeing you as opposed to talking from the perspective of the customer I was wondering whether you had thoughts on how to maybe meld these two ideas and if you just expand on that just for me yeah totally so I think that's great and this is part of this is exactly part of that so between all the voice of customer data were like what you're selecting from what customers tell you then you have to figure out how to string that together right so words like should like when it comes down to it you have to make some more choices sometimes you'll put good in and now I'm just saying you should put in when it comes to you you're still going to use the voice of customer that's completely it so I think about and this isn't an example that I put in here because I talk about it a lot but we rewrote the home page for a sweat block which is this let me know what's what block is it's like if you yea have hyperhidrosis and it just helps you like if you sweat a lot but we opened the page up and this was fully based it had I think 5,000 Amazon reviews and our whole exercise was can we just take like language from Amazon reviews for this product and use what reviewers say about it to write the copy so we did and to beat the control by more than 50 percent paid conversions but the headline became and it was in quotation marks and that's one of a bonus money word things I didn't get to but it was in quotations and it was like the headline read it doesn't even have to be hot out my armpits are always wet that was in the first person that was taken from voice of customer data so yeah like helping the people see themselves on the page but when I see it in the first person in quotation marks I looked at it and if I feel that way now I'm reading along right and as I keep reading down the page then we transitioned into you so we took things out of the first person with the quotation marks and we had a whole section that was just listing out exact examples of what people with hyperhidrosis have to deal with polled in that voice of customer data like people would say I have to tuck tissues inside my shirt I I cannot give high fives I always wear black and so we put that in in the in the second person wears like you're always you always wear a black you can never wear it like gray that sort of thing and so you're doing the same thing and those are all like a thousand money words right those are all just a variety of words that come from what the customer is actually saying so the to work together yeah that's a great question Thanks we have time for one or two over here hi Joanna hi great talk thank you at the beginning you said that you studied copy that worked and copied that ahead and worked and I wondered if you had a corresponding list of words that you avoid because all the other ones I don't have a list of words not to use again I did however recently accidentally send a subject what an email with the subject line that was my placeholder when I don't know what my subject line will be and it was f SD f SF yeah or whatever like you type it quickly over on the side of the keyboard just to like fill in the field and move on with your life it went out with that in it so I'd recommend just double checking everything you write to like pull out the FS DF s out there but no there is no there was no like oh wow that stands out as like that's the worst thing it was mostly like oh we just attacked the whole problem wrong yeah for things that don't work yes this is a specialization of the previous question on the actual CTA button I seem to see a lot of I want to get started kind of stuff is that do we teach that okay except that we recommend that you don't put I want to in it right so if you're writing a CTA the formula the formula to follow generally at least is I want to and then blank whatever fall I was like I want to increase my conversion rate then increase my conversion rate becomes the button except when you're at the place where they're actually like in cart or ready like they're about to have cash change hands and then you don't want a call to value then you want like a call to action thank you so much thanks you
