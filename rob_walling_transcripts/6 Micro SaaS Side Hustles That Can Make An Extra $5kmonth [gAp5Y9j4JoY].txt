micros sass products are small oneperson SAS companies and they make great step one businesses by step one of course I'm referring to my stairstep method of Entrepreneurship one of the big benefits of micros sass is it can get you started on your entrepreneurial journey and it can start bringing money in the door quickly in this video my team and I have dug up six pain points that you might be able to solve with micros SASS and if you've been watching for a while you probably already know you should stick around till the end of the video for my bonus idea that's probably a no- break trer idea number one is a knowledge base with multiple levels of hierarchy I use this idea with permission but anonymously it's from a Tiny Seed founder who posted in our slack the original poster or op writes we've been using help Scout for both our support in our knowledge base for a number of years and we absolutely love them we've been thinking of changing our knowledge base to be more hierarchical and have subdocuments Etc help Scout doesn't support that and neither do a bunch of other knowledge-based systems like intercom everything seems seems to have categories then documents but nothing below it it's something I'm continually messing around with to try and find a good solution because honestly our support doc organization is the pits and with that limitation the moment you have a complex application it makes sense that you would want multiple levels of hierarchy so is this a micras is it a plug-in for help Scout or is it perhaps a knowledge base that starts off as a small MVP and develops into a knowledge base with multiple hierarchies our next idea comes from Twitter user Jerm Rico and it's customer onboarding workflow for Salesforce the op writes I'm looking for customer onboarding for Salesforce it should include collaborative integration plans I do onboarding at my job and it's a pain doing it over email and Excel I'm in charge of clients connecting to our apis for bill payments cash transactions Etc and I guide them through the process for example we sign an NDA they get API keys they do an integration there's certification they sign contracts there's access to production testing and launch we do all this with just Excel and email and a few folks chimed in on this thread and suggested tools like onboard. arrows2 and the op followed up with I had a demo with them I wasn't sure if this was onboard. or arrow and the op said I loved it sadly I'm constrained by company tools and red tape and I'm also tied to Salesforce idea number three is a credit-based billing system and it comes at us from Jeff on Twitter Jeff Roberts writes a credit-based Billing System you buy X number of credits and it tracks redemptions now in my research I don't believe stripe offers credit consumption they do offer metered billing but that's different so the first step in this would be researching does stripe support this and the second question would be is there a way to add this on as a third-party component I think there is the big question is how many people need this as an engine and how much would people be willing to pay for it idea number four comes from Cel Bez on Twitter and they're asking for a dependency outage autoresponder a tool where you declare your critical dependencies for example versel cloud flare subase then you connect your customer support tool Twitter DMS email the tool then does a status check of each service regularly and the tool automatically answers with a predefined message during dependency downtime idea number five marks a second appearance for this tool it's analytics for super base this is a quick one it comes from John hanstock on Twitter John says connect your superbase instance and see feature adoption and usage automatically per customer idea number six is square space e-commerce discount code manager and we dug this up on the Squarespace feature request forums the original poster or op rights is there a way to generate a unique number of discount codes in batches it's important for us to generate unique codes for our members creating them one by1 is very time-consuming we're looking for a way to generate them in batches and ideally export them from Squarespace for easier distribution alternatively we're open to importing coupons if that is possible this post got more than 10 responses from folks wanting to do the same and the op was requesting this for Squarespace but we switched over and looked at Shopify and there are a handful of these types of apps seem to be doing well in that ecosystem so maybe there's opportunity in this one in a second I'm going to give you the seventh bonus idea before I do that I want to tell you about our online community microcom connect it's at microcom connect.com we have more than 5,000 bootstrapped and mostly bootstrap software entrepreneurs and SAS Founders in this community we have a free tier a basic tier and a premium paid tier it's highly moderated it's very high quality High signal to noise ratio and it's a worldwide community of entrepreneurs just like yourself you should check it out microcomp connect.com the seventh bonus idea is a pipe drive addin for Microsoft Outlook we pulled this one from a pipe Drive feature request and the op writes I'm using Microsoft Outlook on Mac and Windows using a pipe drive addin for Outlook to rightclick on an email to automatically create a contact or a lead in pipe drive would save me a lot of time so we did a little research addins are pipe drive's equivalent of plugins and on this thread more than 25 people piled on they chimed in to request this same functionality pipe Drive offered something like this before but they deprecated it pipe dries customer service recommended a plug-in for Gmail because Gmail is the same as Outlook I don't know so this seems like an obvious need that was once filled and has been unfulfilled is there a void in this market I don't know seems like it could be worth some research and some conversations you might be wondering to yourself if building a micro sass is even worth it shouldn't you just swing for the fences and try to build something huge in this next video I'm going to lay out why micras just might be the right Next Step for you make sure to check it out
