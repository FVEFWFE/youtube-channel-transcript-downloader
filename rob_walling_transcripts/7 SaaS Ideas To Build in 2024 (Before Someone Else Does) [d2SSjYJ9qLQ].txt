================================================================================

it's that time of year again winter is coming we're amidst the holidays and I'm wearing of course my classic Lumberjack Chic so in light of the holidays I wanted to bring you my loyal viewer a brand new list of seven SAS ideas that you could start building in the new year and if you stick around till the end I'm going to give you an eighth bonus idea it's probably one you've never thought of as I walk through these ideas I'll let you know where we found them some of them are on public forums like Reddit or Twitter and we of course will link those up in the description below idea number one is client portals for Wix which we found on reddit.com and the poster writes I am a freelance and full-time agency art director my current portfolio is on Wix I would love to set up a client portal or Hub on my site that allows clients to access files folders submit project requests as well as receive invoices and send payments ideally with their own individual logins have any of you had success doing this on Wix or other sites totally fine if it's a plugin if it works well enough I've heard of CRM services like Salesforce and HubSpot but they may be too expensive for what I'm trying to do and in fact I think they are too expensive client portals for Wix this would be one that I would take a peek does it exist is it any good does it have good ratings this could be a great step one business idea number two is a support ticket system for clickup and we found this on the clickup forums where people can make requests for new features what you can tell from this ticket is that clickup doesn't have a native support ticket system and there's a 5-year-old feature request with 2500 upvotes with their users basically begging for a solution so clickup has offered kind of a pseudo solution but users appointed it's basically a workaround and many many people are unsatisfied with it so it feels like there's a lot of Market pull here for someone to create a great step one business although this would have a lot of platform risk so it's definitely something I would think about as a step one business my producers found this by looking at different feature request boards for the various large SAS marketplaces that we have listed at microf.com marketplaces if you're interested in building that step one or step two business in an existing ecosystem or App Store head to microf.com marketplaces to get a big list of places you can check out idea number three is an architecture plans review and commenting tool you might think of this like frame.io for architectural drawings we found this one on Reddit and we'll link it up in the description the op writes my firm has expressed interest in making the switch to digital for all of our in-house drawing reviews this is for check prints Squad checks shop drawing reviews Etc we're a pretty small firm of mostly contractors I'm one of five Engineers so I was looking for Alternatives in place of the larger Enterprise software Suites blue beam seems to be the most common but I think that may be a bit excessive for our needs I imagine most of of us would just use normal pen and highlighting tools with the occasional text box here and there we currently use Nero for our PDF needs but the review tools are terrible Edge has a nice pen tool but the highlighter is only for embedded text and the op asks what do you use he's asking in an architecture group and then they wrap up with while working from home last year most of us just Ed Nitro Adobe with a mouse but that was hell very inefficient there are obviously other tools on the market that can kind of do this but if you read this post there isn't a great solution for this and blue beam the alternative that they mentioned starts at $240 a seat so if I were to build this I'd be thinking about can I build a streamline tool that does this and exactly this to where perhaps I could undercut one of these bigger players idea number four is from nugget. one thanks to founder Justin Vincent for letting me use one of his ideas in this video this idea is an in-person event venue setup planner the op writes I a stage hand at a rental performance venue on an almost most daily basis we have to communicate with rental customers who describe in writing or on the phone the setup they desire for the stage and the venue upon their arrival many times what they ask for isn't sufficient for their actual needs or they were picturing something different in their heads or we were picturing something different based on our knowledge and our equipment I would like an app that could be front-loaded by us with the amount types and capacities of equipment available to rent everything from sound shells to a dance floor to the number of chairs risers microphone spotlights coordinated with the amount of time and Personnel it would take to accomplish each setup but obviously only we would see that part customers could drag and drop items onto a diagram of our stage so we would have a visual of exactly how they want chairs and risers and microphones placed we would use this multiple times weekly in our rental setup I would even want to store certain companies or renters that rent often from us so everyone in the shop would know what they want even if they hadn't worked with the customer before this would save us a lot of time and therefore a lot of person hours and money idea five and six are around the ever popular and fast growing no code ecosystem idea number five is from Twitter and it's Version Control for no code this is from JB Jeff on Twitter he requested Version Control for low code SAS apps should be in the form of UI plugins that can be embedded into other SAS apps features view history set versions create branches collaborate with others initiate rollbacks web hooks for Integrations I think this is a great idea idea is it even possible to build how hard to build I don't know but this is definitely a pain point that people are running into following up on that idea number six is automated testing for no code or low code applications when we are code we have unit tests integration tests system tests all kinds of tests and we didn't used to and the code was brittle things would break we would introduce errors and bugs as we changed it no Code and low code have not solved this yet someone will it maybe it's the no code platforms themselves or May maybe it's an indie developer like yourself who builds a plugin and solves this for their users the seventh idea before we get to the bonus comes to us from Nick Swan on Twitter and it's low setup product analytics Nick Swan the founder of seot testing.com chimes in he'd like to see a product Analytics tool that you don't need a consultant to set up and run just install the JavaScript snippet it tracks all page visits and all actions taken you tell it the final event you want to happen for example a subscription than you page and it tells you the common pages SL actions used and visited so that you can figure out what actions successful users take to see value in your tool in a second I'm going to give you an eighth bonus idea but before I do that if you haven't picked up my new book The SAS Playbook how to build a multi-million dollar startup without Venture Capital should check it out it's available on Amazon or wherever greater books are sold or you can buy it for me directly SAS playbook.com it's available in all the formats you'd want including Kindle PDF paperback and audio it's even available on Audible if you've already read the book and you got value out of it I'd love a five star review on Amazon or audible really appreciate all your support the bonus idea for today comes from Justin Duke on Twitter he requested an API that lets me post a payload of HTML a device type and a Target app and it returns a screenshot of that HTML rendered as an email on that device in that app this reminds me a bit of litmus which is a tool that allows you to view emails and I maybe even web pages on multiple devices but he's added a bit of a Twist to it and it might be something you want to tackle make sure you're subscribe to the channel to
