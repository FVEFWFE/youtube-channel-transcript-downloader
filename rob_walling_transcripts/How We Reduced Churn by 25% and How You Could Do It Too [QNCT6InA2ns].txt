[Music] but so my name wrong procurement Express comm Sassa that helps me have breakfast lunch and dinner with my kids so as good as it sounds max only eats brown food though he wants to put tomato ketchup on everything it's it's a disaster and I can't get the little two-star and top the Krabby Patties right so that's not about nuts about that so um probably more from your perspective we are b2b us after we sell to finance teams we help them manage their purchasing and we're so we fell to like - two - sorry and 200 employees that sort of size and what I'm going to talk about is churn and how to reduce it but let's face it probably we don't pay as much attention to turn you might like so and even though we all know is churn it is important so just by show of hands if you have a hand put it up very very good thank you yeah yeah keep it up if you're happy with your turn right okay and keep it up if you have a if you don't have a plan sorry sorry if you put your hand up keep your hand up if you're not happy with your turn and then keep it up if you know how to fix it okay there's actually only a few you we should just go outside maybe but we should all be happy about it so I want to give you a few more enthusiastic about it so let's do the math on the situation every time I hear a word math now I heard this guy Andrew young American publication he wants to try and make America being harder he's an interesting guy but of course we're in Europe so let's do the maths instead and let's do the math on why turn really matter so what I'm gonna show you helped us reduce our turn from 2.2 22.5% over a course of a year and and you might say well it's hard to get excited about so let's just figure out what that means internally for you in terms a lot of actual revenue number that might make difference in your business let's make the math easy let's say if you could if you had a churn of 4 percent 25 percent reduction not 1 percent times 5/12 you know a year I would give you 12 percent more mor well that's quite a nice figure and it's worth paying attention to and yet let's face it and spend lots of time on sales lots of time programming marketing or what do we actually have to do what tools we have to actually improve our churn frustrating there's a lot out there you know like mostly it comes down to success and what I think is success definitely the way we used to do it I think it hello kitty here by the way every call starts to copyright and she beep you our rules in this presentation so bear with me but you know success is generally do you the way you reduce churn and when you take a success why you hate to be responsive friendly documentation you know be there when you need it but really just you know not parent if your customer is metaphorically still coquetry trying to use your software the last thing they want to see is a cat what they want to is maybe a fireman together matter of three or and you might want to hire height you have seen Breaking Bad these jokes aren't gonna work either it's not Hank it's actually been since the South African guy works with me he heads up her support and we sat down and figured out how can we get out of this sort of reactive we actually do something about improving churn that's not just wait for the plugins forget takes let's come up with a plan and he said James I used to work in a five-star hotel and you know the difference between a five-star hotel and a four-star hotel the difference is in a five-star hotel they anticipate their needs before you have that hmm that's interesting I like that how can we do that how could we come up with something or we can actually be more proactive not just try and fix the bugs or whatever like we actually help our customers cuz we spend all this half getting them up to the sign-up days especially in SAS you've got to expand them most of the revenue for our customers comes through expansion revenue not actually new revenue so let's let's do something about this so I'm going to show you is I'm going to show you the process that we rolled out sort of beginning this year more or less the beginning of this year we've done this about 60 times 60 different times and it's it's a so what we're going to do is we're going to figure out who our best customer it's not just the customers that our success team are interacting with most and sometimes not we're gonna make up some sort of excuse to interact with them more order than the software or not breaking I know we're going to find out how to deliver value for them and then set goals around how they can use our product more and be more successful so this is so first up how do you figure out who your best customers are what is a couple of ways your lots of people are using NPS scores figure out you know who is happy and who is not there's e OG Shaun Ellis customer survey which basically asks our customers how disappointed would you be if you could no longer use our software which is survey I like using and that'll give you a subset of your customers somewhere hopefully between 40 and 50 percent it actually are really would be really disappointed if they couldn't use your software anymore those guys are the guys who I want to put effort into not necessarily people who were doing a poor job for you want to look after them of course but what I want to do is I'm gonna work two people who really love our software and try and expand that usage more so the tool we came up with or the excuse is what hopefully you know if Dan Martell just believes that video on what a quarterly Business Review or Executive Business Review and bigger software companies often use this to reach out to customers and to engage with them before they're having a problem so what we'll do is I will send out emails client I got my list of you know my 60 or so favorite customers customers would like us to pass I will send out an email to them every month or so the selection of them say hey I'm the CEO or pyramid Express I notice you're using the software a lot but I want to be able to jump on a call because I think there's a couple of ways I could help you get even more value that email gets a great response rate we sign up the call and then it's me and Vince and sometimes a product person sometimes someone from say oh I'm not calm I'll pound it we talk to the customers and we do something like this so I'm going to show you the actual template that we use for our what we call our QPR's and our business reviews to order your business reviews and and it starts off something like so we customize it obviously you put their customer name in there we explain to them about actually the aim of this presentation is to session if they drive more value for them and how they're using the product we tell them I'm going to show you exactly how other customers similar to you are using the product to drive success and and then at the end that I always say I'm gonna have a present for you always like to cover off there's always a couple of things sometimes people are getting onto these calls because actually there's something being bugging them that they didn't really want to raise a ticket on or whatever but it's something else I always leave that open ask them is there anything else you want to cover at the end of this call and note that down see I don't worry I'm gonna get to that sometimes you get into a little bit of customer support there and then we get into the actual review so the point is you got to provide value in what you're doing here so how we do this or how I do it is we do an audit of their usage this is their similar to an audit that we do for them so I would go through before to call I'll have prepared put in things like you know how long they've been a customer you know how active they are in the product I like to put in names of people who are actually using the product more or less you know could then they get to see and then they start to smooth I put some effort into this presentation I like it so it opens them up a little bit and start to listen more to what you're doing are you talking about I know no bottom gets a little bit more interesting say oh I see you've got lots of budgets in there it's ending spending lots of money that's really good you know true our platform ticular and then I get to the PS line and in this example here 734 MPs I know all of our customers have a great MPs we use segments our sorry Santos meter com2 quarterly review at a happiness of our customers that gives me a number of customer by customer how happy they are in this instance when does a low number like a 7 what I say is you know what was part of the reason we're on this call is I notice that this 7 is lower than I would like it to be and that tells me that you might be happy with the product but maybe there's someone else in your organization you know what that could be in our case sometimes it's the guys in the stores you don't like using the mobile app or it's someone who doesn't like having to account for our expense when they're making a spending company money whatever it is point is it opens up a genuine conversation and you start to get some action points together on how you could actually improve that so you might say hey do you have any any idea why your NPS might be lower than the antenna average sometimes they'll say they'll give you everything say okay well you think we could set up some training or could I record a video for that person fine get them on board or get more usage from it whatever it is point is be genuinely useful or come to being really useful so and doctor then gives you moves on to the product usage so you can see each customer we measure how many of the features they're using there's customers like 6 or 7 percent and I'll go down through say hey you're using us for this and this and this but I notice hey you're not using this for expense management you think you could do that yeah actually I didn't know you big guys did experiment maybe I could do that as well great do you think we could set a goal maybe for six months five if you start using us for expense management you're already paying for the software why don't you use it more sometimes they need to pay us more to do that than sometimes they add more users and whatever sometimes not doesn't really not point is deliver value so once we set those milestones we agree a follow up date and then one of my favorite parts of the QB or I'll come in with the product stuff I'll explain what's coming in the product what they think about it sometimes I'll show them screenshots give ask their opinion on what we're going which direction going very good for sort of product development stuff and then the magic question how could we win more business no how could we actually be more useful for you and how could you pay us more and they'll normally have a few ideas but we've been talking about a few of these of those ideas up until now that is where you'll start creating deals in your CRM they may come up ideas you know what actually we have sister company I haven't known someone else and if they have someone that you can refer up to I'll show you this so this is from catered my Mike Mike eight artists from caters and uses a promotion like this say there's some safe thank you for being on this call do you know we have a five hundred dollar referral fee for a referring customer get a chance to really being acute crews and that's a sort of a thank you all for that Mike what works this works really well for Mike actually doesn't work for us at all so it's bad what we were starting to do now is just offer them a mug or t-shirt or baby grow or whatever from our store so in summary that's how we reduced our turn by 25 percent and I hope you found it useful it's y'all later [Applause]
