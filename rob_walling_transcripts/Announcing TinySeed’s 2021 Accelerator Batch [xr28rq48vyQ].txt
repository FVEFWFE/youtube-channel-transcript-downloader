(bright music) - Hi, I'm Rob Walling, the co-founder of TinySeed. TinySeed is a year-long, remote accelerator designed for SaaS founders. We launched three years ago with the thesis that there are thousands of companies every year that could benefit from funding, advice, community, and mentorship, but who don't need traditional venture capital. The results have been incredible. And for the past three months, we've been reviewing hundreds of applications from some of the most impressive SaaS founders around the world in preparation for a third batch of TinySeed startups. We've continued to be inspired by the volume and the quality of companies that apply. Today, I'm excited to announce the 18 companies and 31 founders we'll be working with in our next batch. The first is Aurelius, founded by Zack Naylor and Joseph Szczesniak. Aurelius is an all-in-one space for researchers to organize notes, capture insights, analyze data, and share outcomes with their team. Next up is Breachsense, started by Josh Amishav. Breachsense enables security teams to reset stolen usernames and passwords before criminals exploit them. Then we have CloudForecast, founded by Tony Chan and Francois Lagier. CloudForecast eliminates wasted costs in Amazon Web Services without significant engineering resources. Through easy-to-understand emails and Slack reports, engineering teams can quickly react to cost anomalies that can otherwise sit for weeks. Number four is CraftyBase launched by Nicole Pascoe and Nathan Hawes. CraftyBase is inventory and bookkeeping software for sellers who make handmade goods. Next up is Harbor Plan, started by Clinton Agresti and Rob Carrington. Harbor Plan is an out-of-the-box sales tool that enables non-tech savvy users to follow up with leads automatically via email and text message. Then there's Lasso Analytics, founded by Andrew and Laura Fiebert. Lasso Analytics is an all-in-one affiliate marketing plugin for WordPress. Lasso helps you create beautiful product displays, find new affiliate opportunities, and easily manage all of your important links in one place. Next is Lexgo, founded by Leonardo Barrientos, Juan José Figueroa, and José Burdiles. Lexgo is the first automated legal service for startups in Latin America, enabling founders to complete their legal processes faster and at a fraction of the cost of a lawyer. Number eight is Localyser started by Tarik Qahawish. Localyser is an online reputation management solution that helps brick and mortar businesses manage all their reviews across multiple platforms in one place. Next is Monolith Forensics from Matt Danner. Monolith Forensics is case, evidence, and lab management software for digital forensics labs and teams. Then there's MSPCFO, founded by Larry Cobrin. MSPCFO leverages the data in a managed service provider's systems to identify actionable items that can drive growth and stability to the bottom line. Then we have NewsCatcher, started by Artem Bugara, and Maksym Sugonyaka. NewsCatcher allows users to search through an indexed database of online news articles in near real-time. Next is Planifi from Tom Vandervort and JJ Branthingham. Planifi provides project and resource planning for architects and engineers, making it easy for design professionals to plan and schedule projects, forecast performance, and predict staffing needs across offices and disciplines. Then there's Postaga, founded by Andy Cabasso and Sam Brodie. Postaga is an all-in-one link building and outreach platform that helps marketers quickly and easily drive traffic, increase search rankings, and get press coverage. Postaga analyzes your website, blog posts, and podcasts to find and help you act on the best outreach opportunities. Number 14 is Rails Autoscale, started by Adam McCray. Rails Autoscale is a Heroku add-on for avoiding app slowdowns and lowering your Heroku bill. Then there's Security Studio, from Evan Francen and Kevin Orth. Security Studio is a suite of tools that helps small and medium-sized companies assess and manage their cyber security risks. Next is Senior Place launched by Jason Buckingham and JD Huntington. Senior Place offers a CRM designed specifically for the rapidly-growing senior Pplacement and referral industry. Then we have Testable, founded by Constantin Rezlescu and Ciprian Amariei. Testable helps behavioral researchers create experiments and surveys in minutes instead of hours or days, using natural language instead of code. And finally, there's Zentake by Stephen Kohler. Zentake is a patient intake management tool that improves patient interactions for medical practices via HIPAA compliant electronic forms. I wanna congratulate the companies in our Spring 2021 batch, and give everyone a warm welcome. Applications for our fall batch open this summer. If you're interested in funding without the headache of traditional venture capital, you'd like access to an incredible network, and mentorship from world-class SaaS founders, make sure you're on our email list by signing up at tinyseed.com. Or, if you're a bootstrapped SaaS founder doing more than $5,000 in monthly revenue, and you wanna be considered for late acceptance into this batch, head to tinyseed.com/apply. Thank you again to everyone who applied. I'm looking forward to a great year ahead. (soft music)
