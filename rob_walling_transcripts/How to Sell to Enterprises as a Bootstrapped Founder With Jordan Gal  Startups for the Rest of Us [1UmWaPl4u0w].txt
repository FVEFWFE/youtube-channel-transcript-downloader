================================================================================

the question is what successful strategies have been used by bootstrap sas founders to help mitigate actual or perceived risk when selling to early customers especially enterprise we've all dealt with this i think unless you're running a low touch sales process we're charging 40 bucks a month i mean even in the early days of the first customer who's going to pass 200 or 250 which is nowhere near enterprise i know bootstrappers call that enterprise but enterprise is like fortune 1000 right it's these are big companies versus someone paying you a thousand a month or something that's just a bigger customer in mid market or whatever but we've all experienced this i know you have two what are your thoughts on this this is something that everyone faces early on if you're bootstrapping if you're a small team you've got that credibility gap this is the conundrum of dua do you say we are working on it or i'm working on it it's even more difficult as the price goes up and as the customer size goes up so the the way i look at this is is at card hook one of the things we learned was that there was a more complicated metrics of fit for customers we used to look at it as one metric if you're doing enough revenue you're a good fit as we got more sophisticated in that we started to understand that there's multiple types of fit there's financial fit there's strategic fit there's cultural fit there's technical fit all these different types i think what the person writing in is referring to is a risk tolerance fit there are people out there that are down to take that risk and they like being early and they like being a beta customer and they want to take a chance on you and support you and be part of that and if you're talking to a company that is extremely hesitant on that it's not that you're building the wrong thing it's not that you can't do it it's not that there's a mismatch between the type of companies that you're working you want to work on and the size of your team it might just be that there's a mismatch between that particular prospect not being one of those people that want to take a risk so it's tough to overcome and you can make assurances you can talk about more collection of money up front you could talk about your track record you could talk about your plans you could talk about your war chest whatever you want to do but you also want to make sure that you're talking the right person who wants to be a beta customer early adopters right that's really done that's the name in our industry for folks who are willing to take a chance on a new entrant into a market because the early adopters often see an advantage to using new software something innovative maybe it'll reduce their training costs maybe they'll reduce the cost of their maybe they're paying a lot of money and you're going to be cheaper maybe it'll be more powerful you know and they're willing to take those risks and then they're the what is it it's the the early adopters this is from jeffrey moore's book crossing the chasm and there's like five or six of them in the the last one is the laggards and these are the people that maybe you're talking to a laggard right and you're at the opposite end of the spectrum i have heard this conversation happen many times in especially in like slack channels and that i'm in around you know like microsoft connect and some other founder channels and part of it i mean there's someone who's running like a four-person five-person bootstrap sas company and they are doing i don't know let's say half million or a million a year i mean you know relative large for bootstrap size but relatively small in the scheme of companies and he gets this question frequently once a month twice a month of wow you seem really small how big is your team how much revenue do you do how many customers gets these types of questions and he basically handles it like being pretty honest frankly and and saying well here's our team we've been in business for seven years they've been around a long time right we've been in business for seven years we have this many like they have i don't know more than a thousand customers or something paying us we have a lot of long-term contracts like financially we're very viable the software has been stable you figure out which of these things you can rely on now all the things i just said noah who's asking this question can't rely on any of those because he doesn't even really have anything yet right so that's that's a hard problem if you don't have a product yet it comes back to what you said which is just figuring out which of the levers of which things does this prospect really want out of it and if they're so concerned or they're so hung up on their risk of being an early adopter then they are probably unfortunately even though you have a relationship with them not a good customer for you yet yep yep i always give the advice to skew toward the transparency because then you don't need to keep up the charade about behaving as a customer support person and then a success person and using different names and i mean i've heard some crazy things from people you just don't need to keep up that trade you can be honest and then your customer or prospect will just get the real view on things then they'll get bought in i think one idea he threw out in the email he says one idea to reduce this risk might be to allow significant prepayment up front as a way for them meaning the school to provide capital that makes their commitment safer which i'm almost like wait a minute it doesn't sound like the opposite yeah cause they're giving you a bunch of a bunch of money but i mean certainly if you can convince them to do that why wouldn't you do that's kind of like customer funding right that's what that's referred to i just don't think that someone who's risk-averse is going to volunteer to pay you for three years of the software without anything yes but but it is also a good indicator of demand so when when we had our first really big merchant approach us really big for our situation approaches cardhook we almost used it as a test and we explained to them exactly who we were and that we were learning and the things were starting to go well but it wasn't you know wasn't all good and then we put the price to them product at that point was 300 a month plus a transaction fee and we said to them if you can commit to us for a year at 10 000 a month then we will make all these changes that are necessary for you and change the infrastructure and all that and they said yes and that was a really important indicator for us to understand okay so now we can think about pricing differently we think about our value differently we can build out our infrastructure differently so it was helpful in that way to find an early adopter that was willing to commit to the money because they knew that that was going to help fund us and help fund the infrastructure so it's kind of a two-way street yeah i like that i like a lot actually the other thing i would say when i i think of noah's situation is you have an idea to build enterprise version of software that is focused on small businesses and you are talking to the school that you used to work at my biggest concern is even if they say yes you spend six months or a year building this you sell it to them what then what next like does anyone else care about enterprise software in this space is this a thing like what other validation i would be doing more validation before i tried to sell one company on it because what you may find is that you you've built yourself a consulting agreement where you're not actually getting paid for all of it you know you're getting a monthly fee for a product that you have one one customer for the market size is one yep so good luck with that noah i hope i hope you keep us [Music] to find a updated
