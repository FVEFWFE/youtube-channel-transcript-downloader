[Music] [Applause] thank you guys so my name is Matt Moltar and for about eleven years I was a police officer and I left that and started a company called agency 360 agency 360 there what they do is we we have a SAS tool that helps public safety organizations like police departments and 911 centers we help them track and monitor the onboarding of their new hires and about three years ago I needed to hire more people I got so busy that I needed some help and I screwed it up big time big time and what I'd like to do is share with you guys a few of the lessons I learned and and how we use those lessons in hiring our new team so right now when I look back at the last three years and how I screwed this up I think of hiring is like this banana-peel in the middle of the floor have you ever seen like The Three Stooges or cartoon spongebob and somebody drops a banana peel and you just know it's so predictable you just know someone's gonna come and step on that banana peel and slip and fall that's how hiring is I knew hiring was important right I had I had heard all about how your first hires make or break your company how a people hire other a people you know I listen to the podcast from Rob and Mike and all of their advice and I still still screwed it up and if you've ever hired the wrong person I cannot tell you the pain that that causes the nightmares I still have from issues not only does it cost you productivity and time and lost revenue but the stress the stress is crazy wrong way there we go crazy on your family right because you know I want worked in and family to kind of intertwine and it rubs off on them big time and I didn't I should clarify this too I didn't just screw up hiring my first full-time employee I didn't screw up hiring my second full-time employee I screwed up my first five full-time employees I don't even know why I'm still in business anymore but I learned a lot through this process and like I said I'd like to share with you how we change things and and really improved and change the team from the first lesson I want to share with you is know what you want from this employee my first hire was a contractor relationship and we started get busy and I was like hey I like how this is working how about we get together and you come on full-time and work with me and she said yeah and what we didn't do is lay out what our job description was you know we didn't create that foundation of how this was supposed to work and it came back to bite us that kind of started the cracks in our relationship day one the cracks were there and they just got bigger and bigger and bigger so now we put a lot of time into the job description and random starwars pictures its micro cough right we've got to talk about star wars somewhere so when I think about my job description I think about what do you need you know what do I need I need someone that cares about sales more than I do so I don't have to worry about it culture what kind of culture mica trying to create I have a family you know I want to integrate work and life into that so you know will this person fit into that what kind of culture am I trying to create and the key with the job description is to be as transparent as possible like right in the beginning we talked about hey 60% of your time is you know like take a sales manager that we just we just hired 60% your time is going to be working on our inbound leads it's gonna be doing online demos it's gonna be following up with emails but 30% of your time we want you we think you should have 30 percent of your time data court dedicated towards outbound things and 10% of your time is going to be random stuff because that's what we need when we're running a small like this and one of the biggest things we added we're creating a profile here but one of the biggest things we added that got great response from the candidates themselves was at the end of job description we put what does it look like if you did a good job what does a good job look like and so many people came up to us and said we love that that's you know help them visualize the position and think of themselves in that role and whether they could be successful in that role so lesson number one put the time in in the job description lesson number two don't be desperate we got into a position where we needed a developer and we were promising features and deadlines were coming and we didn't have anybody to do it and finally someone came in that was a good coder but in a small company we need more than just a good coder we need someone who can manage the project who knows about architecture front-end UI UX kind of stuff and and we brought this person in and I mean it cost us a year you know took us another six months to fix all the problems afterwards so this is real real pain here so now we take our time you know our goal is to get three to five candidates we want it to be a hard decision who we hire right so we're going to promote and take as long as we need to find the right people and we're looking for a sales manager in our example here that we just hired we're due lope where do sales managers reside no LinkedIn most of them are on LinkedIn so we put it you know we approach this with an inbound and outbound campaign so we put it in the inbound put the LinkedIn ad out there get that going we tell our friends we have our co-workers tell their friends we tell our family we tell our customers that we're hiring get that generating and also do an outbound campaign that's where I'm looking hey what jobs near me have have people doing a similar position that I think could bring their experience over and I just reach out to him cold hey we're looking we're looking to grow are you still happy where you're at let's chat both processes the kind of the inbound reaching out to all your friends family and the outbound have delivered great candidates to us so the key lesson and after you collect all that you need to track it all again if you use LinkedIn they've got a nice little manager tool but if you use Google spreadsheet that's fine one power tip don't create this complex matrix of how you're evaluating people keep it simple they either meet your standards or they don't so take your time be patient the third big lesson so we hired somebody for a marketing position and we did a great job description we were patient we had a ton of great candidates they thought they could do the job they came from a big company I thought oh doing this as a small company that's gonna be easy compared to where I came from and that's not true we didn't test their skills for ourselves so now we always run them through tests to make sure they can do what we want them to do on a daily basis and we and we frame it very nicely so we'd like you to come in for a longer interview so that you can learn what a day in the life is like because these are the things you're going to be doing every day and we can see your skills and we've got three exercises we're going to put you through so in the case of the sales manager we had our three exercises was follow-up to an inbound lead someone filled out our schedule a demo call them right our second one was a present an online demo present a website or a feature they have a website you know right and the third is come up with a cold campaign how would you approach our customers this was so insightful the cream of the top cream of the crop really rises in this in this situation so in our inbound lead for exam and that exercise we'd literally leave the room and we give them the instructions like hey we're gonna do this inbound lead when you're ready we're not trying to pressure them you know when you're ready call and we're gonna mock through it and you learn so much right in the beginning first question do you have any questions before we start if they really care about sales they'll say something like yeah what's the next step in the in the lead process what stage are we trying to get them to what's the common objections that you receive we go through the scenario talk to them and it doesn't matter what their answers are in the scenario but I'm asking myself what's their tone is this something our customers are gonna relate to is this someone they'll they'll be able to connect with and then at the end we all get together and the first question is how do you think you did you know did they'd and they'll go on they'll say oh I think I did this well or I didn't do this well and there's such power and insight and learning that a good sales person might say something like oh I did this real well but I really screwed up this and I was so nervous and the whole time you're thinking well I didn't sense they were nervous if that's how they were when they're nervous that's awesome it's really a lot to learn there so those are the three lessons get the foundation right be patient as you wait for your candidates and test their skills it's made a huge difference for us I feel like I'm not stepping on the banana peel anymore and falling on my butt but I love talking about this topic there's so much more to share I'll be happy to share with you our job descriptions our emails everything reach out to me matt at agency 360 comm or we'll be around the conference the rest the rest of the day and early tomorrow but thank you guys so much and best of luck scaling your companies and growing your teams
