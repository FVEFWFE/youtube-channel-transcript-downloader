what if I told you that right now there are founders building sixf fig businesses by creating micro SAS apps for platforms you already know today I'm sitting down with sneer alof a non-technical Founder who followed my stairstep approach to go from dropshipping and selling eBooks to growing an app portfolio for monday.com Marketplace to $330,000 in monthly recurring Revenue in less than a year in the next few minutes you'll learn how sneer identified and validated these specific opportunities the exact Playbook he used to get his first 10 customers and the key strategies he used to take his apps from0 to more than $30,000 a month before we get started I want to say thanks to monday.com for sponsoring this video If youve thought about building a SAS but you weren't sure where to start you won't want to miss this chat let's dive in sne you've built a handful of Monday apps can you give us a quick overview of the portfolio that you've built yes of course um so we have around uh four apps on Monday uh we have an AI we have a couple of cool automations app does a couple of Co automations that are really useful in Monday we have an integration with Google Sheets and we also have um an app that basically allows you to add the same item to multiple boards on Monday so those are the four apps that we currently have on the marketplace I get emails pretty much every week asking me how to find these kinds of ideas right or these kinds of marketplace opportunities can you help me understand how you came up with these ideas yeah of course um so the first one the AI assistant was really just a project that we shipped for the Monday hackathon so Monday hosted the hackathon for developers to build some cool AI features AI apps um that integrate with Monday so that was the first one we came up with the idea in a day build it and um just uh launched it it was really uh quick and dirty and um that's how we Shi that one um the second app I would say the Google Sheets one was um really came out of a need that I had and something that I thought was really um my intuition said that there should be an integration between Monday to Google Sheets uh so I kind of built it out of my own need and I also assume that other users on Monday have that need um so that's how the second one uh was developed the third one was actually an so we took inspiration from a couple of apps that already were on Monday um which for more about creating some more creative automations inside the platform and uh the fourth one so that was the app that we actually validated the uh the idea and found that this was indeed a need in the market so let's dig into to the same item on multiple boards because it sounds like that's the one you did the most validation for how you said you you got on Zoom calls or something how many people did you talk to and did you do like pre purchases where people paid you in advance or did you get a few gues and then go off building yes that's a that's a funny story actually because uh we went on uh on Facebook groups and just saw some people ask me hey how do I build that setup for my business on Monday how do I do this warl on Monday and um I just told them hey I'm a Monday implementor I can set the whole Monday account for you while I was not really that that wasn't what I was doing at that time but I just wanted to get some feedback from people so I got him on a call I asked okay uh show me what you're looking to get done and uh this need like they they were able to explain what they're looking to do and there are some solutions inside M day that allowed to do it but um in their mind how the workflow they had in mind was supposed to to go was really to have the same item in multiple boards um so I got I think like five interviews like that uh it's it was an interview from my point of view for them they was receiving like a consultation for their Monday setup Beyond those interviews we also looked at Facebook groups and we looked at Monday Community forums and we saw that this topic is really is really hot like people are actually asking for it it's been out there for a while and yeah this need uh is still unmet so this is how we decided to build a solution for it got it so you didn't ask for money you just vetted that people really needed it and there was a lot of conversation around it at the idea yeah exactly and um I guess we didn't ask for money at font we built it in a very cheap way and we just launched it so it was really quick to develop it uh we did invest a lot of resources into building that product and yeah we just shipped a very lean version of what what it could be like we all of the fs that we have today were not even close to to what we shipped initially so that was kind of the validation to see if people are willing to pay for it we just build it launched it it was very lean and yeah when we saw that people are willing to pay for it even with the few couple features that we had when we first launched do you remember how many weeks it took you to get to m I think it it was honestly developed in around two weeks um yeah it took us two weeks but there there's also um phase where you need to get approved by Monday so we had a couple of other weeks uh going through that um um riew process uh so I guess in a month or so we were already live with this uh product and the sales came in the first week so yeah well I mean it sounds like you said you kept it simple I mean you must have kept it really simple to to you know be able to launch something in 2 weeks and you're not a developer right so how did you possibly usually it's the developer who goes and you know puts in 10 12 hours and can launch something in two weeks even something simple as a as a non-technical Founder in essence how were you able to manage to get an app built in such a short time I actually ran a web development agency so I had a couple of uh developers on my team um I just decided to take one of my developers um and told him hey I have an idea for you know let's try to build a couple of Monday apps um let's see if that can uh that can be something cool so I just took my developer I just explained the idea I went over the documentation as well to kind of see what could be done even though I'm not a developer I could kind of understand um what what can be done with it and I just told him okay um if I get this right you can do that and that and that so let's try to build something that can do that and that than that um like the those were the instructions didn't have any um product requirement documents it was honestly like a 10 minutes SC and he came back to me and show me that it's actually working um so that's how I I went about it even though I'm not a developer myself yeah but you had that experience running an agency that helps a lot so you have this product built this MVP that you got out in shockingly you know short amount of time after doing a bit of validation but not overdoing it you know it's not like spent months validating or months building it sounds like it was a couple weeks couple weeks you have this build how do you launch it like how do you let people know that this is out there so first of all the I think because the the need was uh was really high um I just U posted everywhere that that were like a Monday Community there was like a Facebook groups it was the Monday Community forms well actually the places where I went to validate the idea were the exact same places where I la like where I advertised it uh we could say um I simply created Facebook posts and um cre I reped to people on those uh on the money Community for where they asked for this feature I just rep to them directly and like quoted them and said hey this feature is now available check the app Marketplace and this is how I got the the first traffic um yeah and I think because it was even though it was lean it was kind of good it was kind of working um and we uh we were able to like I chose the categories on the marketplace in a in kind of a smart way I could say and I I chose like the categories inside the marketplace where uh we could potentially get more traffic so that was also like a kind of small thing that we that we did to get more traffic in the first um the first month yeah something I often say is when you're trying to validate an idea if you can't get any potential customers to talk to you now how will you do that once you have a product and it sounds like part of your validation was just seeing that a lot of people were willing to talk to you I know you were talking about being you know you were saying you were an implementer and all that but still there was a lot of conversation already and and I think it's it's less about the tech and it's more about the need and the pain point that you uncovered right yeah that that's the that's exactly it in a minute sneer and I chat about how that initial launch went and the exact strategies he used to get to that $330,000 in Mr but first I want to reiterate why I think first-time Founders should build an app or an extension on top of an existing platform like monday.com as sneer mentioned Monday already has a huge audience in fact they have over 225,000 customers across more than 200 Industries this means he didn't have to focus on customer education and marketing 94% of monday.com large paying accounts have at least one app installed which is why I think there's a lot of opportunity to build a SAS on top of the platform if you aren't familiar monday.com is a multiproduct platform that runs all core aspects of work business owners and teams of all sorts use it to streamline their work using their Work Management CRM service and Dev products if you want to build a product like sneer the team at monday.com has put together a great ebook that lays out their core user groups the job titles they'll often have their pain points and use cases for the platform it's a treasure Trove of customer research laid out for you and you can get it for free to get your copy head over to the link below fill out the form and sign up for a developer account thanks to monday.com for sponsoring this video let's get back to our conversation so we can hear about sneer growth strategies so you've launched and you've let people know that this app exists what was the initial response to launching that MVP in terms of Revenue yeah um so the first month I think we did around 1.5k the second month was an increase to 7K it was really going uh yeah the third month was already like 17K something like that those those were the numbers that jump was really high for month through month in the first few months because the need was really was really high um and again um I mean this is kind of a gray area but you know uh when I launched it I said all of the features like the dream version of the product that was kind of the the message that I was trying to to convey to those users so a lot of people installed then they found like some of the features um are still in development but for me it was like like if I can't sell like the dream version of this then like I I couldn't validate so the lunch was kind of the validation uh um mixed with the with the actual lunch right right and it sounds like you also had Word of Mouth like were people telling other folks about the tool yeah um so it got uh really popular among the Monday um community and um Monday forums so yeah users were were really um sharing this app with their um with their friends a lot of Monday implementors that were really installing those uh workflows for for their clients uh found this app and um started sharing it as well um and yeah we got a lot of uh a lot of Attraction um through water of mouth and after you launched you had good growth the first couple months but you mentioned Offline that you really dove in to having support as a competitive advantage and I think that's something I want to call out here because folks feel like sometimes if they're going to be build a Marketplace app um that it's more set it and forget it but you you didn't just put it out there promote it and then oh look it's just growing right yeah support have been the I would say the biggest uh growth engine that we had um so we simply add like a chat widget inside the app nothing too fancy um and yeah J just started speaking with us and um while some of them were asking about technical um bugs or struggles that they had with the PO which is also good feedback for us to understand like what doesn't work uh as good as we uh want to so a lot of the users came and just asked hey can this product do one to three can I do this extra um um feature uh and we got a lot of ideas from our users and we knew how to prioritize the road map based on this uh based on those conversations and I was I was basically taking all of those conversations myself and I really got to understand what the market wants like how it's supposed to look like what are the most important features that we ship as soon as possible uh yeah it was really helpful and um highly recommend anyone who's building their own STS um participate in the support add support that is easy to use with a chat um you can always automate it later but if you participate in those conversations you will really understand your users and understand what should be built next got it so being involved in support and really providing high quality support was not only a competitive advantage that it sounds like people were impressed by and were that was probably part of your word of mouth is that people like use this tool the you know the developers of it are really uh friendly and knowledgeable and helpful but it also helped guide the the road map to help you continue to grow is that right yeah absolutely and uh when I uh when I think about other apps that I um installed on Monday to kind of see how they're doing things I didn't see anyone offering chat support inside the app um and our level of support was really big beyond what the market expected that it was really just by itself just by having like someone to speak with um right when you used the app was a huge advantage of people told us up front like uh I chose you even though your app is kind of doing what the other what one of the competitors is doing I chose you because your support is um exceptional right and so in in conversations we've had you've talked about four things that you focused on to really help grow this app and one you've already mentioned in this interview which is you did stuff that didn't scale to get initial traction right you had conversations you went to forums and then you went back and you posted like that doesn't scale infinitely but you it got you that first month or two of growth you've also uh talked offline about how you really focused on optimizing your listing in the monday.com app store can you help me understand you know what the thought process is there so when it comes to optimizing the listing um think you should keep in mind two things first is the message that you convey that people will actually read and also how the algorithm will read what you're writing and how you're um posting and uh structuring your your listing um what I decided to do even though the app um might not be directly related for example for emails I added in the back end keywords emails because I saw that if I go and type something into the search bar they suggest email so I just decided to go with those keywords um to get attraction to get the attention of uh of users so that was kind of uh the one thing that we did there and we also invested into having um a very good uh expanded video in the in the listing itself so users will be able to land on the page understand what it does what are the benefits um you can also have there there is a long text that you can put on the listing uh especially in Monday but um I I doubt that anyone is actually reading this huge chunk of text so try to use um images or video to convey uh what your app can do and why U how it's going to help your users yeah and this is the thing that folks should learn if they're going to build for an app Marketplace or an app store is that each of them ranks and and and searches a little differently and so you need to learn enough about how that algorithm Works in order to you know figure out how to get your more towards the top of you know of the searches so to speak or of the listings so that that was two things you did third thing you did which you've already mentioned was you continued to evolve the product right you haven't let it go stagnant you've built features based on customer requests that comes back to the you know the support thing earlier I bet folks think they can set it and forget it and kind of abandon abandon an app and it's just it's not going to do very well over time you will get overtaken um so I want to set that expectation but the last thing is it sounds like you've uh asked your customers for reviews in the App Store talk us through that yeah um so it was uh really obvious for me in the first um when we first launched that we must get uh the attention and we must get some um clicks we need we need to do something uh and reviews are I think the best way to to go about it like if someone sees two apps one of them has no reviews the other one has 100 reviews at least it it will start by checking the one with the reviews and see what they're all about so um in the first few months of the app each user that I got a call with them do like an onboarding or even customer support call if something didn't work I was straightforward in asking them for a review I was uh sometimes I was even uh uh telling them okay you need to click here and then you click here and then you click on the five stars to post a review um most of them will would give you that review like this is honestly how they would rate your app but you know people are just I don't want to say lazy but it just you know no one stops their day to post their review so sometimes you need to actually take them by the hand and um yeah kind of push them into giving you that review and I think this is a huge advantage that we now have in the marketplace we have a really big amount of reviews um and that um that also helps in getting attention and also helps in you know kind of keeping competitors away because who wants to compete with an app with so many reviews yeah well thanks so much
