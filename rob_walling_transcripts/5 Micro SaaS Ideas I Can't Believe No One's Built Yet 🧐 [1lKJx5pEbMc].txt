for first-time Founders I often recommend that they don't try to build a standalone SAS instead I recommend they find a marketplace where they can build an app a Plugin or an extension so they can focus on the product side of the business without having to also learn and manage the marketing and the demand side of the business in this video we've teamed up with today's sponsor monday.com to give you five SAS Marketplace ideas that you could build as a great step one business in my stairstep method of Entrepreneurship but before we dive into the ideas let's look at why building an app for the Monday app Marketplace is a good opportunity to begin if you aren't familiar with monday.com it's a versatile platform that enables business owners and teams of all sorts to streamline their work with a wide range of customizable building blocks for easy integration and streamlined workflows their customers are looking for an all-in-one place to manage tasks projects and processes and generally keep everyone on their team informed and aligned within the platform there's a couple products including Work Management which helps helps organize processes and teams sales CRM which is you can imagine it's a CRM built on monday.com and finally Monday Dev which is infrastructure for product and development teams that helps them manage their software development processes Monday has over 186,000 customers if you can believe it across more than 200 Industries with teams ranging from two people all the way up to 7,000 seats in a single account which means could be a big opportunity for expansion Revenue also monday. is used by 50% of the Fortune 500 and they are seeing massive growth in Enterprise customers 90% of their large paying accounts have at least one app installed which is why I think there's a lot of opportunity to build a micras on top of the monday.com platform and with that let's dive into the ideas the first idea I'm calling quick item add this app would allow users to quickly add an item to any other board they have access to without leaving the board that they are currently viewing power users often oversee multiple projects or teams and often items from one board are interdependent with another so they need to quickly add a new item to a secondary board in order to move forward with the current project they're working on for example let's say you're working on your own SAS ideas board and you remember that you need to ask your Mastermind group about using Facebook ads to drive email signups instead of opening yet another tab it'd be great if you could use an app to add an item to your masterminds board without breaking your focus if you can make it simple to add tasks or items across multiple boards without switching context you might just have a winner idea number two is short links and share analytics if you've ever shared a link that looks like this then you already understand what the user is looking for here instead the link could have looked like this so this app should generate a short customizable URL for any public board work do or form created in monday.com not only does this improve usability and Aesthetics but it makes the links easier to share and easier to remember additional features could include tracking and analytics so the user can see the number number of views and visits to each link you could also build in Slug customization so that users can customize the short link to some extent making it relevant to the board or the documents content and one idea for a premium version is you can include domain customization to enable users to connect their own domain for generating short links Additionally you could offer security and privacy settings on a perlink basis to let users set expiration dates on links and password protect them I've seen a number of these businesses work outside of monday.com so this seems like it could be a good opportunity idea number three is a crossboard item dependency manager if you've ever managed a project you know that managing dependencies across multiple boards for complex projects involving a bunch of interrelated tasks that span different teams can easily cause a lot of headaches it's too easy to get lost in all of the complexity so for this one you can think about building an interface that enables the user to create and manage dependencies between items located on different boards bypassing the single board limitation of monday.com or maybe you could build a dependency visual visualization that creates a visual map or flowchart showing how tasks across various boards are related to one another you could also integrate the native automation capabilities that are already built into monday.com developer framework to alert their user or their team members when a change in one item affects linked items on other boards for teams that have complex task management and sometimes convoluted processes something like this could help keep everything moving smoothly in a minute I'm going to tell you about two more ideas but first I want to say thanks to our sponsor m.com after looking through the platform I really do think there's a lot of opportunity to build a step one business here the Monday app Marketplace gives you a lot of data points where you can gather competitive analysis things like reviews number of downloads and pricing their feature request forum is also a gold mine of problems that actual users of their software are trying to solve they also have robust developer documentation and they're committed to helping developers be successful and there's an apps developer Community where you can ask questions and work out any sticking points during the build process the the ideas in this video are just a few that we pulled together with the help of their team they've actually pulled more ideas together and they've put them into an app ideas directory that you can check out at this link that will also include in the show notes monday.com has told us that a revenue share plan will be implemented in the future but for now you'll keep 100% of what you earn and they'll even handle the billing natively this is really smart if they're encouraging developers to build in the marketplace if you're interested in learning more about building on monday.com head to monday.com slapp developer and sign up for a free developer account not only will you get access to all the resources I've mentioned so far in the video but you'll also get a bonus that I'll tell you about at the end of the video let's get back to the ideas idea number four is an AI powered dock to board converter so this idea is for those of you who are excited to experiment with AI could you build an app that can analyze a work doc or even just a portion of a work Doc and intelligently convert it into a monday.com board so using AI this tool would not just copy text but it would understand it it would create relevant tasks and add them to a designated monday.com board the app could further enhance task management by automatically classifying prioritizing and assigning tasks based on the content analysis this could be especially useful for converting strategic plans meeting minutes product specs or marketing briefs into organized project tasks streamlining the process from document analysis to actionable execution and our fifth idea today is a boards to slides generator so for this one the user is looking for an app that could automatically convert a select board into a well structured slide deck through an integration with Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint or keynote hey that's what I use I know it's like the little little sibling of slides in PowerPoint so whichever formats you decide to support from that point the user could then edit the slides but this would eliminate a bunch of tedious manual effort and perhaps within your app the user could create custom templates for any recurring reports presentations they find themselves creating on a regular basis I could see this being valuable for professionals who regularly need to turn project updates metrics or plans into an organized presentation whether that be for stakeholders team syncs or client meetings the ideas and opportunities for Integrations definitely don't stop there the Monday app Marketplace is relatively young with only 500 apps live in the system and when you compare that to the number of customers that I said they had earlier there's obviously room for opportunity here this is the kind of marketplace that has less competition than a lot of the other Market places we talk about and there's still plenty of use cases that need to be addressed oh and remember the bonus I mentioned earlier to quickly learn about monday.com power users and the problems they're looking to solve the team at Monday has put together an ebook that lays out their core user groups the job titles they'll often have their pain points and use cases for the platform it's a treasure Trove of customer research laid out for you and you can get it for free to get your copy head to the link below fill out the form and sign up for
