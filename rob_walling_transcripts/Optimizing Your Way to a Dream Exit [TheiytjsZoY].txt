[Music] okay so in June of 2017 Arvid and I founded a software-as-a-service in the education technology space called feedback panda and about a year after that when it was generating 25k a month we quit our jobs and went all-in and about a year after that when we were at 55 km RR we sold it to sure swift capital so today our burden I want to share how we went from founding to exit and about two years and some of the optimizations that made it all possible so the first thing that we optimized was our audience quite often when I'm describing feedback panda I have to start by describing the space that we actually fit into and this is because we got super specific about the audience that we wanted to serve let me just show you so here's where we ended up we were going to focus on ESL teachers based in the USA teaching online to Chinese children contracted by Chinese kid English companies okay this was this was a niche but niche should not be confused with small we knew at the time of our founding that one company alone operating under this kid English model already had 10,000 teachers and they were growing like crazy today they're somewhere over 70,000 teachers contracted to work for this company and this was this is currently 70,000 teachers with the same problem so being having this niche focus allowed us to uncover the common problem that each of these teachers shared and then it allowed us to focus our energy in producing the product that would solve all of their this one problem so we built one product to solve one called common problem which translated to one standard use case and that is the thing that informed all of everything that followed including our marketing so because we had this laser focus on this niche communication was streamlined we knew exactly who to talk to we found out where these online teachers shared tricks of the trade and we joined their communities and so we weren't looking to get into the community and disrupt online teaching we got into the community to observe to see what needs were being expressed by the teachers and then when they expressed the need for our solution we were there to present it so from there we grew organically and we turned the early adopters into ambassadors of our feedback panda tribe and this is just a handful of the posts from teachers raving about feedback panda on Facebook and our Instagram page is also full of posts from teachers giving product demos and urging their colleagues to join our club to join the club we created for them and so we really did create a tribe around our product and I would love to give another talk actually on how we leverage this user-generated content to then amplify the tribe effect that we created a round feedback panda which was our real marketing machine but today I think it's really important for you to understand that this was all possible because we found our audience first we knew exactly who we were building our product for so once we had the product we knew who to talk to and then on the foundational level we optimized our team Harvard and I are quite diverse and our skillset but we really optimize this diversity by getting specific about the different roles that we would take on in our company so we mapped out our company's structure in a chart much like this one including every specific role that we thought was necessary for our team and the greatest consequence of doing something like this was not our fancy new c-level titles which who are exciting but it was actually uncovering the unwanted jobs the job said were necessary and quite important for the business but that neither of us really wanted to do so for example neither of us was really excited about bringing up our skills and learning how to do European taxes so this is something that we contracted an expert to take care of for us so that we could put our energy into the places that were exciting that we wanted to bring up our skills in or that we were better suited for so as our company grew we were able to stay a team of two based on some of the optimizations of that arvind is going to tell you about all right thank you okay well let's talk about operations one of the most enjoyable topics for every boost your business operations often contains a lot of tedious work a lot of repetitive tasks and they can take a long time or they can just just be a lot of them right a lot of stuff that you need to do manually and don't have the time for that so having an audience like ours knowing them really well and being very specific allowed us to deal with these things by documenting and by automating documentation really helps to speed up these tests and automation is super helpful to reduce a number of those kind of things whenever our customers would reach out to us they would pretty much always have very similar questions because they all use the tool in the same way and we build it to be a single purpose tool so the experience was always the same and being a single purpose tool made this also pretty clear that for everything they would be doing there's an optimal way to solve it and once you communicated that to people we had a full customer service conversation that we could just turn into a knowledgebase article we use intercom for a customer service software so whenever a future customer would have the same kind of question they would be automatically suggested that kind of article they would solve it themselves because that's what people really want to do they don't want somebody help them to help them they want to solve it themselves if they can so we wouldn't have to do it and if you do this a couple dozen times before your most common questions may be you need to do it a hundred times for all these kind of questions your product may have then it really reduces the number of tickets that come in or that make it through that kind of self-serving stage we would also start screen recording the things that we would still need to do manually like data merging these kind of things it just wouldn't be able to do automatically and these screen recordings were for our internal use and would speed up ourselves when we would need to do it again a nice side effect of this when we sold the business was that actually this made it very easy to unboard a customer service agent because we had all these videos and all this documentation already in place so we didn't need any extra effort talking about automation we have a lot of client facing customer facing automation at feedback panda we are German company and we have a German bank account or had at least and American customers and they have American credit cards and for some reason American banks really don't like sending money overseas so they would block the charges quite often so we built a custom dunning system to be able to talk to these people immediately after the card was declined and just get them to do the steps to call their bank so we could actually capture the value of their subscription and get them back into it that was extremely helpful to answer brought is a feature that we use that is an intercom feature where you can respond to certain kind of questions with pre-written answers and we use that for let's call it critical interactions people that couldn't log in or people that needed to update their credit card before they could continue zhing the product and sent them really specific messaging and also linked them deeply into a product which allowed us to them them to solve their own problem even while we were sleeping so that was actually quite helpful for us at least to be able to see and we will always keep the tone of all our customer service conversations quite personal quite informal because we wanted people to be able to react to any message should be wrote and feel that it was a conversation that was important for us and it was actually quite nice the people really liked that the stuff you just saw about feedback panda on Facebook they also wrote that stuff about our customer support and that is good marketing if people like your support their friends will actually notice so that worked for us gonna talk about our onboarding strategy because that was super simple where's single purpose product with a single core value so all we needed to do was to show these people this value as soon as we could so they could understand how can I create feedback fast this is how you do it oh that's the value of a product so that was our all onboarding strategy we could focus extremely on that particular thing and I really helped with conversion our conversion rates have been north of 30 percent for the whole duration of the business because people really understood what it was all this documentation and all this automation really helped us in a due diligence phase of the actual acquisition because we would have a lot of information visibility just from using tools like this and using automation there's a lot of data that gets gathered and an acquirer really wants to be able to focus on these kind of things so they need to understand how many resources we need to put in this kind of project how many people do we need to hire all this kind of stuff and making this information visible through automation and documentation make that face really easy we're gonna talk quickly about one last optimization that we made when it doesn't really work for many or all SAS businesses because it's a hit-or-miss pretty much we build our own custom in-house referral system we built that because we knew it's gonna work and we knew that was gonna work because we knew our audience they were not just teachers these teachers were also recruiters they were recruiters for the teaching companies these schools these Chinese teaching companies because they had their own internal referral system where these schools would want their employees to recruit their friends and family to become teachers too so the people already understood the value of a referral system so we could just easily do it was really safe bet and it worked pretty well in January 2019 when we a crystal increased our prices by 50% we also implemented that system and 40% of all our new signups have been coming through this referral system so they worked super well so in conclusion being in a niche and knowing your audience really well was the most important part it's like that everything else came from that it allowed us to focus on the product that solved the proven problem it allowed us to ignore all these extra variables all these kind of edge cases and customizations that you would need to make in a larger market and it allowed us to focus on our business and it also really helped us because we would be able to actually grow and sell the company within two years without hiring a single employee it's great in the acquisition too because during due diligence it wouldn't distract us with all the automation and later it would be really useful in the handover process as well because we had all the documentation in place so thank you very much for listening to us hit the edits here Thanks thank you [Applause]
