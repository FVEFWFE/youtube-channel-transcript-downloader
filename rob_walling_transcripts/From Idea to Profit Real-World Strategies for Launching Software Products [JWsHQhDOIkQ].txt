[Music] I'm Nicolas I'm software project specialist and as a software product specialist I'd like to ask you to stop focusing so much on your product but first a bit of background so indeed I I own this software development agency based in Brussels Belgium we've been there for around 12 years now about 20 people and we are specialized in helping startups saw startups and marketplace startups mostly and I would say we have helped about a bit more than 100 startups over the years and unfortunately out of those 100 there we've seen a lot of failures and so I think we can attribute those failures to some mistakes and I'd like to share with you five kind of mistakes I've identified with them from real-life examples so one of our first customers actually it was a marketplace in the recruitment space so connecting job candidates with recruiters and we built this really nice in VP for them so we build you know nice interface nice framework and everything and then we then came the launch date we put it online and nobody came and well I guess the reason nobody came was that no one was aware that it was there right and I guess it comes from the solidedge we build it and they will come before that just now and as you know it doesn't work right and it's interesting because it's um it's still something that people believe but there are beauty studies about this when it comes to for example mobile apps I think it's Gardner that say that only 0.01% of apps that are put on the App Store actually are actually going to work and the reason is that well there are so many competition right and it's not enough to just put it out there you your project needs marketing second example it's a more recent example we built this how to go like a social vertical social network for people so um put it online on the day of the launch the customers came back to us and I give they handed us a list of all the features they wanted for version 2 to 8 right instead of I don't know focusing on trying to get some traction for the first version and in in a dress affair development we have this concept called the cone of uncertainty that you've probably seen if you are a software developer it essentially says that it's very difficult for a software development team to predict the cost very precisely when we are at the beginning of the project and the reason is that it's actually I mean you can you don't have a crystal ball right it's very difficult to to know what's gonna happen there can be any kind of you know output events like feedback from customers maybe competitors and so yeah it's very it's very difficult so you don't have a crystal ball so I think it doesn't make a lot of sense and I would even dare to say that it's not very respectful for customers because essentially you're telling them that you don't really care about work what they're gonna say about your product you have it all planned out third example yeah that's also something that's kind of related to the first thing we had this we built this MVP for a for a fin tech company building it was about cash flow prediction and put it online same story and then they came to us and they asked us okay you've done this nice MVP but now how should we price it can you help us and I guess well to be fair we we are knowledgeable we are passionate about the SAS industry so we can give some advices based on what we see on the market like the trends and so on but the reality is that we don't actually know because we're not the target market they should probably have as better as their their customers maybe do some kind of competitive analysis or essentially you know make a business plan right so that's a pretty common mistake as well and keep in mind these are not product people I'm a product guy but these people are not technical at all or not Furguson product I still make that mistake the fourth one is probably my favorite month or actually actually the opposite because we see that so often and it's it's really infuriating there was this customer working in a specific industry again a new kind of regulation a new law was about to pass and they wanted to capture that opportunity with a new piece of software but the data low past they actually didn't release the software and even one year later it still wasn't out problems obviously competitors were there other alternatives were there and but still they were nitpicking about very very stupid details like you know like some copy on the about page and some and something like that so I guess it's kind of a the fear of failure I suppose I'm sure you've seen this very famous quote that I really like to share as well from the founder of Lincoln Reid Hoffman and essentially yet I think that would have better really something on the day on the first day and then try to get feedback for it to to improve later on and the last example I want to give as well is it's a different kind of customer so we also help legacy software getting to SAS right so we put them on the cloud essentially and they reached out to us because they were worried about a new competitor are coming up which was raising money and currently very successfully and they told us okay how much to clone this thing and I mean I can't understand it but I think it's again it's a focus on product but here it's even worse because they're focusing not even on their own project right so and even if we were able to copy paste which is very difficult of course I couldn't be a good idea because we would always be chasing the competitor right because obviously it's like a moving target that the committee would still keep going so we actually advise them to rather do something else and find a new edge and a different angle to be better in that specific angle than just trying to copy paste and be a copycat so there are obviously many well-documented ways to avoid these mistakes and I just wanted to share three of them today the first one is it might seem obvious but it's really about trying to see what I mean right trying to focus on what you're trying to solve right the problem not the solution might sound obvious but it's not I mean your customer is essentially buying your product to solve a problem obviously right but what people forget is that they are already solving the problem in a different way right hopefully a less optimal way than the one you you want to sell them but they're still finding they're still already having away and you have to understand that right there is this framework that you might know or not I don't know which is called JT VG which I really like to use in all our new projects which is about I mean facing it like this your piece of software is doing a job right I mean your customer is hiring is hiring this this software and by hiring your software it is firing something else it could be a different kind of software it could be a manual process but it could also be about real people like literally firing and frontally because software does that as well but so really thing about about this you might have seen this picture that's basically people waiting for the commute and I guess the top image is from one century ago I guess and well the other one is more recent and the point here is that projects comes and go come come and go and but the problems say the same right they'll just find new ways to solve the same problem so I guess yeah try to fall in love with the problem not the solution and if you don't know what problem to solve then maybe you can focus it something you like particularly something that you are passionate about something that you approach that you have yourself of course or something you are really knowledgeable about second piece of advice trying to do the things in the right order want to give another example here as well of another customer that it was a meal delivery marketplace like basically homemade meals that you can sell to your to your neighbors and they actually decided to build their community before building the product so they they grew a Facebook group I think up to 50,000 people which is a lot for Belgium and with that they already had a user base essentially so that it allowed them to raise money I think there is two million in dollars or something like that even before building the product so it's very interesting because they could use that money to to build the product and I mean as soon as the particulars was ready already done the people were they were available something else about this probably I've seen that before right it's the lean canvas actually it's a variation of the business model canvas that we use in the Lean Startup methodology is it's essentially a one-page business plan and I usually like to share that with our customers because again focusing in the solution but when you when you think about it the solution is just one box of all those right so you could technically make a lot of different kind of businesses with almost the same kind of solutions and here I'm using solution as another word for product right in this case it's software because you could you know have different kind of customers you could have to sell it over different channels you could have different pricing system and so on to give a novice example that may not be the best but it's it's very clear when you compare for example today the mobile apps of Facebook and LinkedIn they look very similar alright if there's a news feed you can share articles you can like them you can comment on them and so on but I mean it's obviously a totally different job they're they're doing their right you wouldn't probably share baby pictures on LinkedIn for example the third advice is trying to focus on feedback and again I guess really from the start even before you have a product again it's not it might be contouring treated but for example I really focused on the problem again so for example if you're trying to build a fitness tracking app instead of trying to make a prototype and show it to your trade audience try to see how they do before so maybe you would go to gyms see what they're doing to track their fitness stats maybe they are using another app that you don't know maybe like don't maybe are just using pen and paper then why maybe it's not convenient to use an app in that environment I don't know but the point is to really try to get problem feedback so try to again try to make sure you understand the problem you're trying to solve only then you can try to you know find out a solution and try to present it you can do mock-ups you know with balsamic for example or any kind of aloe solution or again pen and paper it's absolutely a cheaper way to try that even before coding I'd be righted we do those so-called design sprint that you probably heard as well a lot of agencies are doing that now the point is to spend one week with a customer building a solution it's very fast actually it doesn't cost that much but you can already test it with customers very early on and in our experience it's solving like 80% of the questions or the feedback that you can get and as you can imagine it's better to know that before coding because easier to - yeah - to change something before it's a hard hard code and the reason for that I think is again another quote that I love is people don't really care about how your your product is you know it's working like the inner workings they just see the interface like they see themselves interacting with them and and I guess yeah that that's why most of the feedback is gonna come from this from this stage and to conclude I guess I mean when I shared this examples of my customers I am maybe you thought well this guy has really stupid customers right but obviously there are studies about this and one of the most famous ones is this one from a Harvard Business Review I think which essentially that saying say that most of them are custom consumer products are gonna fail when they are launched another one I like is this one from CB insight and you see that it's a yeah the top 20 recent stock could fail and the top two actually could be solved with them well by essentially stopping producing the wrong features or product thank you you want to know more I have a checklist that goes into further detail thank you [Applause]
