if a solo founder was to create an application like shopify would this be possible or are there certain regulatory requirements that would make this impossible example to accept credit cards and store customer stripe ids slash merchant credentials in order to make transactions on behalf of their accounts would this require a certain level of auditing that a single founder operation could not pass the word that comes to mind for me is resourcefulness in the early stages you need to answer these questions and my general assumption is that the web is now developed enough that there's a way there's always a way many of us who are familiar with stripe know actually there are no requirements around auditing and you can offload all of that to the payment providers these days because the credit cards never touch your servers so at cardhook we built a business that processed two billion dollars and we were never pci compliant because we didn't need to be because modern web and payment processing technology allows you to do that now sure it's important to know that but the real thing is to be able to figure that out to go look and do the research and dig around and figure out what services do i need to stitch together to make the solution that i have in mind possible the question sounds to me like more of a mental blocker than an actual blocker because you can figure it out and your job is to figure it out and to build minimally in order to get to the value that you're trying to accomplish so technically yes you can do it but the more important thing is regardless of what area you're in if it's ecom or not your job as the founder is to just explore and and figure it out yeah and that's a great summary of it and i think that i think a nice google of this asking stripe looking other folks have built apps like this in the past it feels if you're bootstrapping it but you got to think a lot about security and of hashing and storage my experience with stripe ids is that like you said you don't need to be pci compliant to do it but i haven't built an app like this right so this would be a research and a conversations with folks whether in microcomp connect or on twitter or whatever you can and then this is one of those things where if you're storing stripe ids and your bootstrap that's probably the way to do it assuming you can i'm not giving you advice to do it or not but this is also the reason that some companies raise money if you look back at gumroad's story they originally i think were going to use other payment processes or maybe they even did tie into other payment processors but they wanted to become their own payment processor and i remember talking to someone on the inside it wasn't sahel it was someone else that came wrong and i said you guys raised like a lot of money he raised like seven million dollars after bootstrapping for a while and he said yeah in order to go to banks and get the permission to become a payment processor we needed to raise buckets of money and i think that's probably true it lends some credentials of we have seven million in the bank and we're backed by xyz venture brand name venture capitalist and right or wrong fair or not fair that lends you a certain amount of credibility and flexibility to then do some things like become your own payment processor even that the the complexity of what has been built in tooling around payments even that is challenged because now there's a company called phoenix payments that do all of that for you and allow you to become a payment facilitator by partnering with them so maybe it still costs a few hundred thousand but not a few million so i think generally a bias toward this is possible we're going to just figure out what services are out there to make it possible in the way we need it to be as opposed to a bias toward oh i guess i can't do it because i'm so low and i don't have the resources like that i think that's the general [Music] question
