[Music] so about four months ago I found myself in a let's say stressful CPH my wife and I recently moved to this little city Lisbon we my wife is pregnant before her with how it was baby we have some problems throughout official papers my business is not doing as well as I expected and the money flow is actually very low then again I expected so it's a lot of small things and I started to feel pressure and an exit II and I realize that it it actually hindering my ability to perform well to do my best so it was time to do something so my name is Sergey and - today I'm going to talk about here and how I learn to deal with it in the last 4 month but first that's let's have a first part survive so which of you have ever experienced fear please raise your hand again pretty much everyone so or or relp you who didn't raise we're lazy because here is a natural while making it so it's with us the day we are born so it prevents of doing crazy stuff like this or that and everyone here should think the accesses for being faithful enough so they survived and path of aging so we can sit here enjoy at you and but as fear is natural rough reap main mechanism we can our brain cope with it so you are very very well known self is quite the top one quite so when we feel certain we run and in business context if you are entrepreneur and you have hundreds of responsibilities that you need to you to deal with and a lot of so you can start thinking okay maybe I just go for a normal job right so just maybe I just do some some some normal job and getting good better salary in most cases and I don't have to deal with with the stupid accounting and paychecks and etc the second mechanism is obviously fight right and when we can run the fight and while this one is actually really useful in many cases it has one very bad bear event consequence that we can see and I experience a lot is what's called over rock right when we start when I we start working 10 12 14 hours per day thinking okay I can handle that just one more month two more months and I can get get my big achievement and after that just lay down for a few months trying to recuperate the third one the third mechanism is obviously less but less well known and it's called freeze is when we don't run we don't fight we just sarin one place hoping that the predator goes away and in business in businesses we experience it also a lot it's called procrastination right when we don't go for holiday when we don't go for most most difficult tasks when we for example instead of calling equine we start reading books or go for conferences it's also kind of procrastination so as as I exist grab it I hopefully you know you see that you experience it as well so what graphite mechanism I found via five techniques I found that helped me most of all and the first one is actually oh my yeah he's hiring a turret or coach in my case it was the therapist regular sessions and it finds its if I found it immensely use all right to have someone you can freely talk to you on a regular basis and I mean I talked to my wife I talk to my friends I talk to fellow founders but it's still not the same so when you have a person who who know how to ask direct pointed questions to you and help you to navigate through all the math that's going in the Hat and what my trap has helped me my coaching session help me is to actually connect and their logical person and my mitre has helped me to connect the logical part of me with my emotional part and it actually helped me a lot you to go through proved anxious that is which is was inside me the second part and again that the second technique and my mic mightier please help me to improve it it's called track the roots I think is when we experiment fear when we experience when disappearance beyond experience anxiety is that sometimes we don't we don't fear there but like the real problem which is in front of us that's right now we actually feel something that this problem represents some pain but it represents in the past for example in my case I had problems too to say no to clients yes I was kind of afraid okay if I say no to this client so he leaves or if she doesn't leave psychic like that obviously I cope with it much earlier but it helped me through this sessions helped me to realize to track her down the route that it actually took two places from my childhood in my childhood when my parents at very high expectation to me and I was actually afraid to not 2d to this expectation and I moved it from my childhood to my to my business life so tracking the roots is extremely extremely important and helpful to look at it to look on your fears from from the different angle the third technique is actually physical exercises and many many developers hate that but it's really really helpful because our bodies and our emotions are interconnected and for example if you if you end a bad mood and you make yourself well then you would goes up it's the same is actually with anxa T and we have B fear because our emotions our emotions results in muscle tension in headaches sometime no share and when we when we release the pressure from muscles the entities also goes away so I was kind of skeptical to that in the beginning but right now for example when I experienced some some issues some some difficult problem that I fear I just I just go for retraining and in an hour I'm just a new person and ready to talk want their breath again the top technique is a it's kind of not intuitive one and you can use it when you are in this negative cycle of fear and fear when you for example for example yeah you you didn't reply to the email to your client in time and you start thinking oh you probably you start thinking okay I haven't required what is this client thinks about me right now maybe she thinks I'm in responsible okay she thinks I'm responsible maybe she thinks that I died that she start thinking I don't want I don't want to work with this company because irresponsible people working there but the thing is here we we start so we fear actually not the real situation but our imagination and there the trick to deal with that is actually to go for the worst right like start I mean you you have imaginations try to imagine the worst but it could actually happen like again looking at the example you didn't reply to to the mail in time okay now you mention a case so what's what's the client thing the client thinks aqui I'm you're in responsible so maybe it's probably start working with you but what good or what oh good war sense the client starts calling your other clients and saying hey this person isn't responsible what's next I mean you have no clients what next you have to fire the whole you over your whole team and as you go this cycle imagine in the wars you start realizing how ridiculous it looks like and how low the probability of this event but and it opens again you are then our angle that actually it's it's not as worse as it's possible and the last technique which which I use and it's mostly related to product product development is using time blocks so as a founder as a product owner I have sound equation for it and I I worry about it here so I worry about so how this vision how how my current actions so how my current actions how my daily steps are in line with this region right so how fast I'm going to to achieve that and what routes I have to have to take to reach it as fast as possible and at one point in time I realized that these worries this constant this constant thinking about okay so if my like daily actions are in line with my vision prevented me to do my daily tasks effectively so this is why I started using time blocks what it is it's basically what I do I say ok 1 2 hours per month when I'm playing in my month for example it's the time when I'm allowed to worry about other stuff so I'm worried about vision I worry about so how it's in life how is in line with everything I'm going to do but as soon as I am start layer either start as I stop planing they as soon as I start implementing what what I planned I stop worrying myself so this is kind of a mental trick the same you can do for like weekly planing daily planing early planing whatever you choose so this were five technique I I found very useful in the last four months and they helped me a lot so please use them if you find if you find that you are they fits you and remember that I mean after all development is a long road so enjoy every step needs and be proud you every day thank you
