[Music] [Applause] all right cool so I get the honor of speaking about outbound sales a little while after steli which is fine that's fine all right so I'm Jordan Gaal I run cargo comm with my good buddy Ben Fisher over there and what we do is if you go to one of our customers e-commerce stores and you start checking out but for some reason or whatever excuse you can come up with not to finish buying we hunt you down with an email campaign until you come back and buy like you should have in the first place that's our software business I also run bootstrap web with Brian who is just here a minute ago so here's what I'm talking about today the whole thing with outbound sales inbound that's what all the cool kids do and that's what's scalable and that's what a lot of companies we admire do and I want to do it too it just takes a while so while I want to get there I made the decision that outbound was the right move for us first and I'm gonna attempt to convince you in this talk that it might be a good option for you and I'll basically just show you how we do it maybe you can steal as much of that as possible and mold it for your own situation alright so and this nicely optimized title that you voted for which I appreciate thank you there are two important words the first is aggressively and the second word is efficient so aggressive because I don't know about you I am impatient I'm not as far along as I would like to be I imagine most people here are in the same boat where everything takes longer than you want so I think being aggressive upfront in the beginning stages is really important to move things as soon as possible at the same time we want to be aggressive but we have to be efficient because we're run out of money we're not burning other people's money for self-funded you you can be aggressive but you can't be stupid well you can't you just run out of money and I put a little ako desk because that's what efficiency essentially means to people in our situation all right so if I'm gonna try to sell you on something I should lead with the benefits right the first big benefit of doing outbound sales is the obvious one more money sooner the truth is what the real benefit of doing sales sooner and getting revenue sooner is that it takes away all of your excuses all the just one more feature and then we'll be ready to do X just one more integration then we'll be really ready to you know for primetime this just cuts away all of that because regardless of whatever skill and magic we all possess in this room it's all until you ask a stranger for money and this makes you do that as soon as possible all of us can call somebody on the phone today and ask them for money for our product so that forces you to focus on the right things the second and related benefit is feedback it's as important as sales in the beginning because real people will tell you when you ask them for their credit card and their business they will tell you what's wrong with your product what's good about it what they like what they don't like what they want to see so you get feedback from real people instead of reading blog post and saying oh that's cool how they're doing it maybe we should do it like that the third benefit I don't have a term for it I call it raw material it's just a lot of stuff happens when you email 50 people a day and talk to them on the phone and do that for weeks it just stuff happens so an example is we'll talk to someone about the software and they'll be interested in it but they're not the decision-maker so what they tell us is I need to go to the Wednesday morning marketing meeting with my boss and convince everyone there that we should use cart hook so we quickly learn okay we want cart hook represented in that meeting properly so we create a nice little three page PDF screenshots pricing features everything that you we want them to know instead of putting all the pressure on the non decision-maker that is interested we empower them with a little PDF that they print out they given the meeting something like that we just wouldn't know unless we spoke to people constantly we saw this and then all of a sudden you take the raw material and you create assets now that's an asset that we send out every time we talk to a non decision-maker we send it say hey you can print this out next time you have a meeting bring this with you and that works so there are a lot of things like that even the emails we send manually now we have a library of email so when we automate we'll know what emails to send when based on whatever events we haven't automated yet but the raw material of dealing with these people helps us build up these assets alright I'll stop blathering on I'll show you what do we actually do so we do a four stage process research that's where we find contact information prospecting that's where we actually reach out to people for some reason that shrunk I'm sorry but I'll just say the words on it so prospecting is where we actually reach out to people the demo yes we do the dreaded demo sorry I don't like it either but it works so we do it and then the final step is the actual trial so obviously trial two paid is like the most important thing but this is the top of the funnel I'm not really equipped to talk about that pretend like I'm an expert in that and that goes beyond 12 minutes anyway so that's our process so let's get into the first one research relatively straightforward you just need any contact info so what we did we integrate with the commerce platforms so we go to built with which shows you lists of websites that use specific technologies build with this 500 bucks a month so being a proud bootstrapper I sign up pay 500 bucks download 250,000 records and promptly cancel no shame and that's perfectly rational so now we have hundreds of thousands of emails choose me not emails yet domains we send it over to researcher to find the contact info we get them put it into a Google Doc easy next step the actual fun part the prospecting so we do a combination of emails and calls emails work but for us we actually close the demo the appointment on the phone so email gives us something to say oh yeah you got my email from yesterday but the it all gets closed on the phone so that's that's how we do it and we use a product called cadence by sales loft that helps us run a six by seven so six touches over seven days so it annoys them too giving us an answer one way or another so we do call email call email call email and then we try to push them toward the demo and we add about 50 new prospects a day to it and then the goal similar to what you Ana said how each element in your site should really just do one job here it's the same thing the person doing prospecting the only goal they have is to get a demo they're not thinking about a trial they're not thinking about a customer nothing they just have one goal in mind so anything that comes up what's the pricing like that's a great question to talk about on the demo on Thursday how does that sound basically any question that comes up is a great question asked on the demo how does Thursday at nine o'clock so all right the demo there's a lot of stuff out there about demos the way we do it the way we focus on value we just use base emotion and greed and it helps the prospector so what I mean by that is we don't ever say do you want to see a demo of my products what we say is you are a Magento store we have a Magento store customer they made three thousand dollars last month using our software would you like to see how they did it and then a whole demo isn't check on a product it's let me show you how they made three thousand dollars and in that process for showing them the software how it works and integrates them so they're visualizing I want to make money like this other guy and as opposed to here's my amazing software that has no features right now anew and from the demo their goal is to trial so the trial period that is the first time that someone at cart hook does anything with this process one two and three are all out sourced and the team is only taxed we only do work after a demo so we're only dealing with the absolute best prospects and our job is to get them from demo to trial what we really do is we try to sign up for a free trial while in a demo so at the end of the demo we say are you ready to sign up I can sign you up right now and that's that's our goal but if someone doesn't sign up then we do whatever we can manual and automate it to get them over to a trial and then from there it's actually try to convert and that's a whole other thing so what does it actually look like back to efficiency for prep for research we pay three bucks an hour this is all oDesk and all Philippines just hire people from the Philippines they're the best that's relatively straightforward we pay six bucks an hour for prospecting and we pay twenty five bucks an hour for demo it's 40 hours for and about ten hours and the results we get are like this I put infinity for research it's really there the researcher goes so far in front of everybody else it may as well be infinite so we're never gonna catch up to the researcher the prospector needs to get ten demos the person who does the demo needs to convert fifty percent of them into into five trials and then after that we start to handle things internally let's do some maths one hundred twenty bucks to forty to fifty right now at six hundred bucks a week times four weeks we spend about twenty four hundred bucks a month doing this and if we can convert 50 percent of our ten trials into customers this is what the math ends up looking like I forgot the most important line in there because I did this at 2:00 a.m. sorry Xander we basically add about a thousand bucks in mr r for every twenty four hundred dollars we spent not amazing but depending on your situation you could potentially do that forever and get really profitable it depends on a lot of factors here I'm just going to assume a $99 average revenue per user that's kind of what we aim for so if you look at that there there are a lot of benefits beyond just the money that that you get right so what I call the game changer number one is about marketing so we started this first so instead of guessing what our market wants what our pricing should be what features they care about what process they want to go through we now know because we talk to people every day we sign people up and we're adding customers so now when we redo our marketing site we have the right data from the right people we know what to say so it helps go one direction in marketing and then it also goes the other direction so next week let's say I run Facebook ads and I want to do a webinar 50 people show up to the webinar 10 of them turn into free trials more likely 10 of them are interested in doing a demo now we have a system built out there's nothing new that needs to happen no additional work we already have a system in place for doing demos and converting them into trials and move them forward so it goes both ways on the integration with marketing the second game-changer is annual bill sure Jason Cole would be proud if you can convert 20% so 2 out of the 10 into annual prepaid a thousand bucks instead of 1200 bucks up front sometime over the first 60 days all of a sudden you're adding 2,000 bucks up front to the thousand dollars and mr are all of a sudden you're profitable on this and you have that kind of dream scenario of marketing that's funding itself every month that you can just keep spending more money on it's an infinite marketing budget I think the term would be so that's how we do it obviously there are other things you can do higher conversion rates higher average revenue per user but this is kind of where we're starting and it's it's done an amazing thing for our company in that everything's oriented to sales because we're dealing with real people every day we're trying to get them to pay us money so the whole company's direction and mindset is about selling and selling and selling as opposed to what should we add what is cool what should we new technologies - should we use and I think that's healthier that's about it for me I don't have a picture of my kids I just have a picture of a loser turned into a billionaire which is what I want to be but it's for my kids I swear that's it you
