[Music] so a lot of what I'm about to talk about is gonna sound repetitive because it's a lot of what people like Mike and Erica and and Jason a lot of other people already said but what I'd like to talk about is I don't know if anyone remembers the last year microcon and Amy who talked she kind of mentioned my my new SAS plants go Paul and at that point I just hit a thousand month and I was really happy and I was just noticing that getting customers was a lot harder than I ever thought it would be and I think a lot of us anyone who's built products knows that we all tend to think that you know we're all really excited about what we're building and then we put it in the wild and um until we get through that learning phase that Rob mentioned yesterday it we don't really know that the perfect way to get a new customer so so when I launch plan scope I kind of had I wanted the immediate like I loved I'm one of those guys who when I launched something I will tail the log file and I'll just be glued to KISSmetrics or my analytics and I love being able to see kind of you know somebody comes to my site they read the marketing site they respond to call to action they sign up their trial and what I started finding though is that that's easier said than done getting trying to win somebody over immediately is not always ideal and especially if we're throwing money at people or for paying to bring somebody over to our website we can end up having pretty low results I think so what I'm going to be talking about today is how I've gone from this mindset of immediate gratification to taking weeks or even months before somebody who enters my ecosystem ever becomes a paying customer of mine and I'd like to just talk about the story that led me from plan scope to writing to to having a workshop and ultimately a newsletter so who here does acceptance testing so we know what happy path testing is right which is the you know how we imagine things work in a perfect world so my happy path of sales was somebody Google's for a project management software they hit my marketing site they are convinced by it they come to the signup form they give me their credit card and kick off a trial and become a paying customer that works sometimes but it works conversion rates can be pretty low I mean you know I spent so much time optimizing my marketing site and the call to action and everything else but still there was when I got to starting to set up a paid acquisition I just realized I was it was it wasn't panning out to what I thought it would be and this gets even more complicated when when we started advertising so let's say I run you know an AdWords campaign and I'm wouldn't be great if I was paying two bucks a click and let's say I got a three percent conversion rate I was then paying 67 bucks for trial say 10% convert she went through too quickly anyway I could be looking at three maybe even four figures just get a new customer and until you've had your product up for a while you might not know what your average lifetime value is so you could be losing money getting a new customer which is not exactly where any of us want to be so what I was finding out was I had a pretty high cost per customer act or cost per acquisition but my lifetime value at least initially was was low my goal was to flip that I wanted to I mean this is how you become profitable right you have you spend less money and make more money so what I'd like to do is just talk about what I've done throughout we're really the the epiphanies that led me to build ultimately a flywheel that's now allowing me to have really a 10x ROI so far on what I'm spending to get somebody and what they're ending up paying me so the two things that I really started applying my business are the ideas of by increasing trust and lowering friction it makes somebody more likely to become a customer of mine and I'd like to just kind of overview these two things and then go from there so trust who are you and why do you want my money this is something that there's a there's a certain person there's an amount of risk any time you know one of the things I teach consultants is the reason people would like to pay us less than we might want to charge is that they there's a risk that we will not be able to deliver what we're telling people we'll be able to deliver so we you know we might have these grand ambitions of we have this great software and we're gonna deliver an amazing outcome to the buyer but you know somebody who stumbles upon our site has never met us before they read what we say they might not sure they'll see some testimonials and everything but still the trust is probably relatively lower it's better when people guest blog or your mention on podcasts and people know who you are and everything but if you're just starting out you probably don't have that yet so the counter to the way to establish trust is to over deliver value so one of the things I started really doing is focusing on how can I really in debt people to me and one way to in debt people is to give them a ton of really actionable information that aligns itself with the end goal of your product so you know if I'm building project management software for freelancers I could teach people how to become better freelancers and really give them a lot of tips that have helped me and let them know that not only can I sympathize with I understand their pains III Witham Utley understand problem they're the problems they're going through and why they're looking for something like plan scope and over time I can really prove to them that I know what I'm doing and it makes the barrier of entry and that risk coefficient lower and the second thing is friction how hard will it be to start using this when a lot of us think of product friction we think of okay maybe we need to have stronger call to action or our signup form has too many fields but in reality there's a lot of internal friction there is taking case in point my project management software in order to get somebody to sign up or to actually use my product they need to internalize yes I'm gonna go out this signup form I'm gonna take the time to set up my account maybe get I'm gonna get familiar with this product I'm gonna invite my team and then I'm gonna need to explain to my team why you know what is this why are we why am i making them join me in this and then I'm gonna need to decide am I gonna invent an actual client to work with me on my project invite the client and then most importantly oh my god throw an actual real paying project at this and pray that I don't embarrass myself and these are you know we're always looking for escapes when you when anyone's trying to sell you anything we want any excuse to bail and that's why you know you read something by Shawn D'Souza and he really emphasizes the need to overcome objections we really need to get into the heads of our target customer and realize what are they struggling with as they read our sales copy and really you know throw that back at them and let them know we understand and we want to help them and that's also why long-form sales pages tend to work well too because we have the room to do that so with those two things in mind and this kind of reference is what what mike was just talking about no one buys software no one needs no one wants project management software what they won is a kick-ass consulting company or they want to be more transparent with their clients or something that measurably impacts their business you know no one just says I want to add software to my stack so what this what these three things increasing trust reducing friction and really delivering on outcomes has allowed me to do is think you know instead of saying I'm gonna I build and sell project management software for freelancers instead what if I'm teaching freelancers how to make more money or how to get rid of problem clients or how to invoice veteran and collect money better and instead of sending traffic to my marketing site why not send traffic to a free email course squeeze page that promises to help some B find better clients instead of convincing somebody to ditch their current PM software and switch to mine why not sell them a book with actionable worksheets and teach them to make more money because of something that I've I've given them and then I'll cross sell later my project management software so this is kind of what I've started doing and what's been surprisingly really cool about this is by the time they've become a plan school like this is an actual real customer the only thing that's different is the dates you know four or five months go by they actually sign up for plan scope at that point but by then I've already collected a few hundred bucks from them so it's kind of a almost like paid lead generation in a way but what I've done by then is they've been on my newsletter they've been getting I've been showing up in their inbox weekly I've been giving them free value I've been giving them paid content like he'd mentioned earlier they've read my books they've been in my mind they understand my philosophy on consulting and then the natural next step for a lot of them is okay well I I tend to agree with what Brennan saying about consulting and how to work with clients maybe I'd be interested in a software so this is a again and this is a actual profile of a customer I also have a 12 inch ruler workshop which is a really nice boost to customer lifetime value and this is kind of my funnel that I've set up and you'll notice the end goal plants go my SAS isn't you know it's kind of buried farther down and granted some people go directly to plants cope but ultimately where I'm sending traffic is this newsletter because with this newsletter I'm getting ridiculously high opt-in rates which I'll show you in a second and then I'm able to introduce low friction or lower friction offerings transactional products impulse buys you know getting adopting new software reverse getting a book that's going to teach you how to make more money as a freelancer they're you know Way equal and the value comes much sooner when somebody gets that book which software I mean think of think of signing up for hit tell if I taking you weeks to derive value from it and that's just the nature of a lot of a lot of software so you remember that into it out I showed before as a sample of an ad that sends traffic to a marketing site this is a ad I'm running on LinkedIn and Facebook down I think about two to ten o'clock I'm getting a forty percent conversion rate which is awesome and I'm spending about five and a quarter to get somebody on my newsletter I now have a list of forty five hundred it's actually I submitted this Wednesday so it's like a forty six hundred now I've had some churn so ultimately I've had I think fifty one hundred total people on my list since August its generate a two hundred thirty thousand and this is just through email you know I just have autoresponders that say if somebody buys this book cross-sell dusts over time for us sell that over time and this has allowed me to really have a as Rob would put it a flywheel that is consistently saying if I spend a five and a quarter to get somebody I'll reliably get about 10x off of them so the big takeaway and what I didn't really mention about the glue is everyone I have this mailing list that here's free weekly I know Joanna has a we cleanest list I know quite a few of us might because I'm a I'm a staple and a lot of people's inboxes and I'm giving them value if they if they don't get value they're gonna unsubscribe and that's fine I mean I can I don't imagine that everyone on the planet identifies as a consultant is going to be able to learn something from me but if you if you can what I'm doing is I'm building up this trust and I'm letting them know that I want to help them and you know if they're getting a let's say a one to one time to digest verses value output coefficient with my newsletter I let them know they're gonna get a 10x or 100x with my workshop and this really does I mean it's it's almost upwards of 60% of people who sign up for plants cope I can find on my newsletter and they've been there for a while a lot of them so what I'm finding is by taking things slow by over delivering value over a long period of time and then collecting the the results have been I mean I could not have gotten the growth I'm getting now on plan scope could not have been done had I done what I was doing before which is buying ads and sending them to my marketing site and I know like like I think Jason mentioned one of the benefits of up for an annual cut pricing is you can kind of recoup that customer acquisition cost early on but this is for more cash flow sensitive people and if you're not able to get a lot of annual payments upfront this is something you might want to consider take your time / - liver value and have intelligent cross selling paths and upselling paths that capture monetary value over time so thank you
