================================================================================

all right so first of all raise your hand real high real proud of you've no idea who I am you've never heard of me you or don't do this you and the other person in that role I you know appreciate you people you keep me grounded people that know me that's that is weird all right so here's what I'll try to do I will speak almost nothing about myself and then we'll talk a little bit about how to optimize your sales funnel I'll try to leave as much time as possible for Chuy so you can practice something that you need to cultivate if you want to be good at selling which is being proactive and taking what you need versus being you know just leaning back in your chair and be like enlighten me with all your wisdom but I don't want to think or work for it at all does that make sense this is yes this is no this is way too early and the good content hasn't started so what do you want them okay so let me tell you a little bit about myself anyways the clicker doesn't work so just imagine there's a logo that says close close calm oh there you go so this is the company that I run it's an inside CL CRM a lot of startups tech companies around the world use us to close more deals and make more sales they're interesting maybe for those they don't know is that we are fully involved company 40 people in 14 different countries around the world so fully distributed we are highly profitable eight digit right and we compete against some of the largest businesses in SAS in the world right this the CRM category is slightly competitive people so we know a thing that - about competing against really large companies doing it with a very very small team cool who knows this really handsome gentlemen raise your real high yes Ethan Shaw I wanted only the myth the legend the man he's not just pretty he's really wise and kind so for all of you that after this will have some level of selling withdrawal be like oh my god I need sell these voice in my ears twice a week Tuesday and Friday for 20 minutes screaming at me but not just him I need a little bit of a counterbalance maybe heating shop you're good at this startup chat comm you subscribe to we're almost 500 episodes deep we've been doing this for five years and lots of people tell us that they enjoy it and they learn lots from it so I've written a ton about sales and there's a I think at this point twelve ebooks on selling every ebook is a two to three hour read so these are short reads they're not poetic literary masterpieces right so there's a comma missing here there there's probably a misspelling or something but I guarantee you you're not gonna be able to read one of these books and not get value from it or something you're doing instantly it's very very practical stuff so you send me an email steli at closed comm just a bundle you get a link you download a folder for free with all the books whenever you're doing something you're trying to hire your first salesperson you read the book about sales hiring you're trying to improve your demos you read the book on devil's whatever you need I've organized it neatly for you read it and then when you fall out precious or you try my stuff and it isn't working you email me I'll help you does that make sense yes thank you one person I appreciate you applause is free and it makes people feel good so you should be heavy-handed with it just like smiles right or not it's not an affirming of the human being make them feel good so do it all right so first let's think about like when it comes to your sales funnel I'll touch on a few things everybody here has to hear because most of us do wrong and then we'll go into your specific problems ideally when you ask a question like I want to ask you a theoretical questions but even more importantly think about a deal you're currently trying to close something you struggle something you've lost make it concrete so it's going to be much more useful much more memorable for you raise your hand if they're if you're currently trying to close some kind of a deal you're talking to a prospect there's something that you would quantify as a deal if you're trying to get to buy your product raise your hand all right this is a good amount of you all right so this should be useful so first thing you need to do is you need to qualify your prospects right so there's lots of people that either come to you or you put to lots of people and the best way to optimize your results is to waste less of your time and waste less of other people's time so I'm gonna try to sell people that should never buy your product and don't try to find people that you should never have found talking about something they should not know anything about so when it comes to inbound which is going to be most of you people I would assume or a lot of you people you want to have certain signals that allow you to actually push a lead up as a more qualified potential opportunity right and it starts simple of course you can buy very expensive tools to do lead scoring but when they're five leads a year it probably is not worth spending one hundred and twenty thousand dollars on the heat scoring technology besides that with that amount of data you can't forget anything useful from lead story so when you start off just start off simple ask yourself who are our most successful customers and what do they have in common if you don't know that you do the opposite question which is always a good question who would be our worst potential customers right a good way to gain clarity is not just to figure out what you want but you write out specifically what you don't want right because if you don't do that you will sooner or later get confused and go after somebody or something you shouldn't have gone after in the first place so some simple things that you can do I'll tell you when we started this the simplest thing we did at close was very very simple we said let's look at it have we ever closed a customer that came from a young male or Outlook email address the answer was no not a single customer so like well it's been easy color dresses right then we looked at well if we take female like Gmail versus a company now what is the difference in conversion it was something insane I mean insanity in terms of difference of conversion and even more so if you looked at customers that convert it and then who to large customers almost nobody had signed up with the geladas so that we said all right so you sign up with the business address that signal number one that you may be a more qualified prospect number two we looked at location right and we said well he is the beautiful planet people sign up for everywhere around the world but of all these sign ups equally qualified to buy let's look at it turns out no they're not there's five markets that are like thirty times more likely to buy than the rest of the world for us so let's take those five markets and make them signal number two and then signal three was when you signed up we asked you one important question that was relevant to us you answered that these three things made you the high quality prospect or possible make sense very simple right we need to kind of prioritize our time not go after everybody equally then when he talked to people when you actually reach out and try to have a conversation with a prospect here's the source of all your problems all of them if you're in the middle of the deal which a lot of you are and if during trying to negotiate and close that deal there are there's a moment or moments where you're like I don't know what's going on here they said sent me three proposals we did and now radio silence not sure steli what is going on this is just one example it could be a million different examples but you're in the middle of a deal and this now it's not progressing and doing this like I am not quite sure what to do here the problem the source of that problem is you didn't ask the right questions you didn't ask enough questions and here's how we all try to overcompensate for that we just guess I do this all the time I talk to people all the time and they go well I ask me seventy-three proposals hye-won the middle one the low one I put together proposals I sent them and now they're not responding to my illness anymore and I go why do you think that is little well you know I think that maybe on the third proposal I went a bit too high and it scared them off and now I feel like they're afraid if they answer what makes you think any of this well I don't know it was a high number I'm like what did they ever say that they've been scared do they have a high number for me or something like did it like do you what based on what information that they provided to you are you making this interpretation and it always turns out based on zero information that was received from the customer always guesswork I guess what's really happening is it was raining last week in that country and I know finding an umbrella it's really difficult to there prop like we all make these real stories up the reason you don't know what's going on is you never ask the important questions a prospect tells you send me three proposals the answer is not yes it's not the next logical step here the next logical step is to go oh beautiful you want three proposals let me ask you why three wait three what are you going to do with it once you have them what do you do with them what is the next step by the way are you are comparing my three proposals with my competitors three proposals or just tell me unlikely tell me more you need more information send me three proposals is not enough information to know how to manage the deal or what to put in these proposals in the first place 80% of questions that people have to me about like what to put in proposals is because they don't have the information so I guess it should I do it more like this or more like that I'm like well what did the customers say they want they didn't say well did you ask no well there is the problem this is the source of all your problems you don't ask enough questions you don't ask the like questions and when people answer you're not actively listening you're not listening right you take the least amount of information and you run with it you're like oh my god fast one more question I'll ruin this beautiful moment we had right it was so nice they smile I smile I asked they answered why ruin this with more questions right because your job is not to create nicely nicely safe environment conversations that need to know where your job is to convert something to it yes or no you can only do that with knowledge through insight and context so you need to ask the question here's the deal some people you know most people they ask questions just to ask the question they don't really care about the answer these the difference between two exact tape answers I'd say that I only want to sell the companies that are 50 employees so I ask hey how many boys do you guys have we're about 50 cool cool cool and then the next person also says well about 50 well cool cool cool well let me ask now the next question well hold on let me ask have you guys been 50 employees forever have you grown a lot how many boys will you be in the next 12 months now one of them says well yeah since the 60s we've been 50 people right until we die we'll be 50 people will slowly you know scale back the boycott you know unto zero versus the other one that might be saying yeah well no we were five people three months ago we're 50 today we'll be 5,000 tomorrow those are not the same companies not the same prospect not the same customer context the number itself isn't telling the whole story right so you need to qualify better if you qualify better you'll close more waste less time make sense cool so time is really really important by the way and this is something probably really like bootstrappers people there are less resources we think that we oftentimes try to optimize for what is good for us versus what would be best for our customers and prospects I just had a conversation where part of the gist of the conversation was well but it's really painful to have to fly over there I want to expand into this new territory but I don't want to have to do the painful thing of flying over there and doing some of that myself can I just find somebody to do it for myself no answers always know if there's a choice between something painful and less painful probably the mail painful ways the right way right I'm glad you came to this motivational thought all right you're welcome all right so no like there's a reason why we like to just write up for emails right not too many because writing lots of limas against hard work we have to think how do I write 30ml zenus in a sequence that's hard work before like welcome to this tool hey do you want a demo hey you trial is up please by or goodbye right that's simple we can do that and they could have just automate it so everybody gets full school emails and I never have to interact with anybody and just lean back and make it rain let it rain money on me the answer is no there are you competing against other companies and me as a customer I don't care if you're a single person a thousand people it doesn't matter to me it's totally irrelevant well but I don't have that many resources that's your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] problem all right compete for a customer who doesn't care about this I care about time so the thing that you need to know is that when you have a high quality prospect in your funnel you want to get in touch as soon as possible we used to do this across where we call people within five minutes of them signing up for trial why it's a simple fact of life and it sucks but when somebody signs up and gives you their phone number in our case they would do this if you call them an hour later your reach rate meaning the amount of people you actually are going to end up talking to is as high as if you would do a cold call to somebody who never talked to you never giving you their phone number doesn't know you exist the same right around 15 percent of it right isn't that a heartbreaker like they came to you they sign up they have your trial that gave you their phone number permission to call and you'll call and reach as many as if you just call a random person that never wanted to hear but if you call within 5 minutes your reach rate is and this is hard for me to say but it's apparently scientific there was a study made about this 100 you reaches a hundred times I will be all within the first five minutes why because they're probably still on the lap book they just signed up they're probably not out skiing right it's been two minutes since been giving you their phone number and they sign up for free trial they will remember you I could be surprised people who we are as later they won't remember you they won't they sign up for 13 different free trials right and then they got overwhelmed and they're like ah let me play video games for two hours now you calling you like what what what clothes are you wearing like what is this about remember and we think that remember this was just three hours ago no they don't they don't so you hope within five minutes he'll remember this selection looking at your site you can welcome them ask a couple questions point them in the right direction there are companies that have intercom is doing this now they have a whole segment so they'll have prospects coming in and they'll say this prospect is a single individual user it's a small and medium-sized business it's an enterprise company and it's a timely buyer like they have a category of bio where they know the number one criteria for this fires that they need to make a decision fast they need to decide what to buy within the next three or four days they've got a new category like like smaller medium sized this is their buyers they need to make up their mind in here right a very very soon and they know that on average it takes most companies in the SAS world seven to ten days to get in touch with you so they know if we just get in touch with this person faster we'll close the deal because this person needs to make a decision quicker make sense so figure out ways you cannot do this with everybody but with your highest quality prospects one apart is getting faster and it doesn't matter that it doesn't fit into your work routine right and like your but I don't like to get into touch with before fast I'd like to make it fast is really uncomfortable keeps like you either want to be business and make your business and your customers drive and then it's not about your personal preferences it is about your personal preferences find a market in a business dinner can allow you to live your happy life exactly how you want to end it still works at x1 then when you whenever you give we here gives product demos of some kind raise your hand really high right oh good good percentage so there's a little book about this but there's a bunch of like most of your demos are probably terrible right so this is all well if you read my book it's the first step but you actually have to apply it so here's the deal with most demos I'll give you just the quick notes on it if you want to know more about it read my book about how to give product that must itself but you your demos are way too long way too long you probably are booking 60-minute demos with why 60 minutes who decided that 60 minutes is an ideal time I'll tell you why and who nobody and for no reason it's because it's the laziest thing you can do it's because it's a universally accepted unit of time to book with somebody on that calendar so you just do it and then since you have 60 minutes you will fill them with garbage right I'll tell you one thing there's not a product demo on earth that is 60 minutes where the human of the receiving end of the demo could retain the information this I cannot retain 60 minutes of information it's impossible you know what people are going to end up with after your 60 minute demo you know the emotional state that you leave people with after a 60 minute demo it's overwhelming it's exhaustion have you ever had this yourself know if you've ever seen a demo I've been on a call where afterwards you're like I feel overwhelmed right you know who doesn't make decisions people that are over well you know who people don't want to talk more to people that overwhelm them I already am overwhelmed on my own I'm doing well on that end like I don't need more humans and companies that overwhelm me with information a product demo is not product training it's a demonstration of value it's not training it's not supposed to make somebody a black belt in your product right figure out by qualifying them what they need how they're gonna make a decision and then show them on the demo I'm straight how your product is going to impact their lives and then wrap it up is another pet peeve I have people like to clickety-click around for no for no reason whatsoever like this is me and Inter screen of our newsletter software see you can bold things and then they like they're highlighted wording to bold it like what what the hell are we doing with our life why are we doing this why are you doing this to me and then they're like well and then when you want to send the newsletter you click the send button and they click the send button and now we look at this for two seconds before them and now it said why did we have to do this why why did we have to do this this provides zero value to our lives you show me the editor you go here a beautiful editor can write as simple as writing any other email if you ever have and then you move on with life you don't have to click on everything and we link every do you don't have to show me that the sent button works like what is this don't do that and then your demos need to act with a strong call to action this is a really painful truth most product Devils end with nothing the worst endings ever it's like we all think about the beginning where the car gonna start this product a moment to say something smart here and then there and then s week and then I'm gonna show them ABC and then it's simple we get exhausted by even thinking about it and I'm gonna show them all the other stand we never think about the end how am I going to end this demo what exactly am I going to say what is my clothes what's my ass what is the conversion what's the next step we need to take people and the demo mostly with a version of this so well thank you very much for your time and attention and yeah this was great and we we can send you some more information and then yeah oh yeah no it was really great all right goodbye what are you doing what is this what is this alright you're exhausted they're exhausted both parties go on each other anymore because you need a couple of weeks to like recover from this what is this tell me what you do now that I've seen your demo what to decide and tell me one thing and let's go for it and say it in a way that increases my confidence the level of clarity in my life that makes me go yeah now that I see this I'm ready to do something right it's very very simple ask this question what is it going to take to get this deal done this is the virtual close I've written about this a lot this is probably one of the best questions you can ever ask once you qualify somebody I want you to ask this question very early hey now that you've seen my product now that we've discovered that this could be a good mutual fit let me ask you what would it take for you to become a customer ups and then the important thing is you follow up until you've arrived in a virtual point in time where they say and then we would buy right again most of us what we like to do is we always like to stay in the safe space of nothing nothing ventured nothing harm right I didn't really ruin good vibes I show them the product they didn't scream it's not that bad not that bad feels okay why not hang up and now make up a story in my mind that they will buy that story will feel good I can go and tell it to other people they will feel good all of this messy dirty you know pavement like questions like do you have money you want to give it to me ask you know who wants to do that all right and then they have to say no and I have to feel bad and like hang out but we all feel terrible like there you know why not just avoid all this the reason why you don't want to avoid this is because you're in business and your job is not to create safe environments of pleasant conversations that is not your primary goal of existence your goal is to make [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happen to create value and in out of 10 conversations you can turn 6 into harsh notes and pour pour into a yes a conversion and a business relationship that's it's better than having 10 out of 10 you forget about your existence presently though right nobody hates you that's good no it's not your job is not to have nobody hates you your job is to make an impact for some people's lives to create valuable so you asked what would it take for you to become a customer boss and now they say something and whatever they say don't take it don't run with it stay with it oh well next I'll take this information I'll talk to my my team about it ok let's see you talk to UT let's say that conversation goes well what typically happens minutes well next we want to schedule another car with some more stakeholders asking more questions most people it sounds great alright I wish you a beautiful day that's well it's a great game plan they hang up and then they embellish well you know what's gonna happen here we're gonna have one more call next week with them and then they're gonna buy us a tails nobody ever said any of this so you stay with it you go well you're talking too early you jump another call with all stakeholders they asked more questions let's say that call goes well what typically happens next well next we want to put together a pilot and really try out the product to see if it works and I'm buying it again it's just continue just like just hang up and say ok just hang up and say ok just take it around with it just take it and run with it don't ruin this don't ask more questions all these questions went well so far fight that temptation go okay so we're doing a pilot let's talk a little bit about a pilot you know what other key kpi's well yadda yadda yadda and eventually you like let's see that highlight is a success oh now you need to go through leedle leedle okay and so now once we go through legal what then well then you have to talk to procurement ah okay and now that we talk to legal procurement are we in business now no now you have to talk to my grandmother she reads your palm in your future and if your chakra is aligned with the universe then we're in business yes okay now we have a roadmap of what it's going to take to close this deal with information with insights with context now we can step back look at it and go this will never work right I don't have 14 years to close this deal and this will never work or we can set out to make this work out to prepare for a legal permit maybe I should prepare for it now so I'm not surprised when four months into this deal these things come up and I'm totally unprepared for them there's other beautiful things that will come a painful beautiful things like you'll ask it what would it take for you to become a customer of ours and they go you know the truth is a budget is allocated until 2045 but you know I like to stay up to date with the newest technology so I thought it would be a good investment of your my time to watch a demo of your product thank you thank you goodbye let's never talk again right it's good to know you can never close this deal or maybe they'll say oh I don't really know and then that's beautiful you look cool that's a new answer do you don't know how to what wait it would take for you to buy oh well you know I'm an intern this is my first day never really bought anything in this company kind of useful information right well maybe they'll even give you a bigger gift of the truth and they'll say based on everything I heard I don't agree with you I don't think this is a bit beautiful beautiful think about it you think this call went well this demo went well you think they qualify you think they want to buy and then they tell you now what they saw made them grow this is across it's a beautiful moment of truth now you can learn and you can teach go whoa I from everything I heard I was under the impression that this would be a good mutual fit obviously I missed something help me out here what did I miss why isn't this a good why wouldn't you wanna and then either they tell you that your pitch sucked because they think they can't do something now you can learn to pitch better or they will actually educate you on how to prospect better and qualify better because they tell you something that you go yeah they're right they cannot buy my product sucks for them and then you should have figured that out much earlier in the process either way you'll learn but you need to ask the question early it's gonna enlighten you with information versus leaving in the dark in the land of you know peaceful hopefulness that leads to nowhere the power of right now okay do me a favor this is this is something is really gonna speed things up when you actually talk to somebody when you actually interact with the human being and the conversation goes well and there's a next action to be taken take it right then and there I'll give you one beautiful example one example I hate people give a demo they have some kind of a call or meeting and then they go well the next step would be to have a follow-up meeting here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna send you email with a couple of suggestions and then we can find a good time for next week to talk what the hell why why why do you do this why why are you gonna hang up put on your dumb to-do list and I'll follow up email to schedule a time and you have to remember this three hours later in your busy day on which times will let's suggest maybe suggest sometimes you send it to them they now have moved on with their life it's four hours later they're busy they're going home next day they have a big campaign their inbox is flooded with emails it's gonna take them four days to resurface then your email then they look at it again well now it doesn't any of these signs don't work what should I suggest I don't know let me answer this tomorrow and then a couple days later they send you an email be like I can't do these times how about those times those are all times that you can't do it now we're going back into real wasting days of our lives trying to schedule a call you already had them on the phone why not go the next step is to schedule a follow-up call you have your calendar in front of you yeah cool let's look at next week I have mine as well how about you say nine Tuesday isn't good what is good maybe Wednesday when today 9m 1 p.m. 2 p.m. 2 p.m. 2 p.m. is good cool I just sent you an invite can you quickly accept it you're accepted beautiful so 5 seconds you already got it done it's done don't leave people with to-do lists especially when it's small things you could do immediately oh the next step would be for you to sign up for trial how about that hey the next step is to sign up for trial because I didn't waste 60 minutes of your life we're just 30 minutes into this call we can take that next step right now together right let me actually sign you up there's certain industries you have to sign up the people here's a screen share I'm typing what email do you want yada yada yada I'll type in a bat password and I instantly are gonna do like password reset you're getting the email with a password reset I'm waiting for you to reset your password alright boom do you got it you got it cool now that you're inside let's look around the first thing you need to do is you need to upload a spreadsheet do we have the spreadsheet oh you don't have it let's write like you could actually take 10 minutes and babysit them movies then they're done they are done you don't have to email you don't have to follow up you'd have to bother it's already done you when you have somebody's time and attention it's such a precious thing use it use it don't go well we have 20 more minutes but the next step is so simple I can just send you an email about it what why not just do it right there and then get it done and then people oftentimes ask me about urgency like how can I move the deal faster how can I close the deal faster so what can I do to make these humans make up their mind faster there's two ways to do this one I don't like and the other one I like but it's very difficult I'll give you both I really don't like incentive driven urgency I really don't it I find it dumb like I'm like this is sort of dumb why do I have to tell you that there's a porter for promotion that if you buy in the next week you'll get an extra discount we see no free services or upgrade or whatever whatever oh we have a special promotion in October if you by now you're gonna get this cool to me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to me that is my reflexes are not as good as I imagined we could be obviously ii mean it's just so such a like theater like it is dumb why if i buy today i don't get a discount but tomorrow like i get a discomfort tomorrow all of this guy go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me but you know what the realities of this it works it works that's why a lot of companies do this it just works people like it people like it now you can be in the camp of vanillin like it's dumb and then you can suffer the pain of not closing deals oh you can just go with the program this is what people like this is what I'll give them this is what works this is what works alright incentives can work really really well I hate it but they do work the thing that works even better it's much harder to do though is to understand what is urgent in their life and in their business anyways and to see if you can tie what you do into that so when I know not just that you as a marketer are looking into marketing automation software but I ask you important questions like hey this quarter what is the most important thing that's going on in your marketing team what is the big project of KPI that you're trying to reach what are you struggling with what's the most urgent thing you're trying to accomplish what about it is difficult if I had that context and let's say it's about hitting some revenue number maybe I'll sell my marketing automation software something that can help you drive more short-term revenue see how that will be compelling like all I need to do is write short term revenue and now you're selling your software something that will help me that can be a building block on that strategy I would be internally incentivized to want to buy and use this quicker all right versus if you told me that right this quarter the most important thing we're used to safe cost to bring costs down you need to bring costs down by any means now I will try to see can I sell my marketing automation software is something that will save half is there a true compelling honest pitch it's more the cost saving side versus on the revenue getting inside and then it would focus on that could you imagine that when somebody's only were about cost-cutting right now and you talk about only how your marketing stuff will make them more revenue how that is a a misfit in priorities how they would not be compelled to move as quickly as possible buying your software because it's not the highest urgent priority does that make sense so knowing what is already urgent and important in your customer's life can really help speed things up all right but it's much more work because you asked a lot of questions and really pay attention listen you need to actually form your pitch you know and and focus it it's much easier to give everybody the same pitch and then just be like every month we have a special promotion and the last thing I'll tell you before we go into you a couple minutes of Q&amp;A is people will have objections to buying your product no matter how awesome your product is if everybody you talk to wants to buy with no objections you're not going after the right customers you're not going you're not taking enough risks you're not going out for customers that could give you a lot more value in return so the easiest way to manage objections is to realize that it's probably 10 to 15 objections you get all the time every customer doesn't have a unique objection they always it's always the same stuff that comes up I don't have the money we're already using a competitor whatever whatever like we have security concerns but there's a couple of things 5 to 10 things everybody will bring up as objections to purchasing your product write these down in the document these are top ten objections and then write a one two maximum two paragraph answer to those write it down then mark this document version 1 and every week in the beginning that every two weeks every month every quarter you update that there is no excuse to being unprepared to these objections or to be annoyed again somebody that is the same thing again this is fighting reality this being annoyed by reality all right reality versus you you will lose so just embrace it well if everybody says this I can prepare for it so anybody somebody brings this up I could be excited because they didn't prepare for it I am prepared I can now say something smart something that helps right and if everybody always brings up a really big like elephant in let's say everyone you're trying to pitch is telling you well but your competitor is already better we're losing let's say this is the first thing everybody's always saying again here's what most of us do we get annoyed we're like I have against somebody that says this again somebody says well why don't you you know that everybody thinks this is why don't you embrace it why don't you bring it out proactively why don't you go and now that I'm giving you my pitch here's what you're thinking next you're thinking what about this competitor we're already using it it's better right and then they can go yeah here's why and now you answer it right why don't you embrace it make it part of your pitch if it's you know definitely I run away from it they're gonna catch you with it and then you're gonna trip and fall so make sure that you're prepared for the objections and you can embrace them all right that's it for me what questions do you guys
