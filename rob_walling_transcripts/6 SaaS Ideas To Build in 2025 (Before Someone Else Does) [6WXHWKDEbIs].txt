================================================================================

starting a business isn't just about becoming the next Silicon Valley unicorn I think that one of the powers of building software starting SAS companies is about creating Freedom imagine you had an extra 2,000 4,000 or even $10,000 a month in your budget to cover your mortgage maybe a car payment daycare or maybe in your life it covers a lot more than that there is no more profitable business that I know of than B2B SAS I'm Rob Walling I've built and sold a handful of companies I've written five books and I've invested in more than 210 SAS startups I often say that instead of telling me your idea tell me the problem it solves and for whom and so in this video we dug deep into Reddit threads to find six real problems that people in a business context are facing and looking to solve these are ideas that we think have the potential to become real income generating SAS companies these ideas are very unlikely to become billion dooll outcomes but just maybe you could build a business that allows you to kiss your day job goodbye the first idea is Inventory management for custom apparel businesses and we'll link up the Reddit threads for all six of these ideas in the description and in this video I use the acronym op for original poster the person who posted the idea the op writes we are a relatively small company that produces custom apparel for artists musicians other businesses as well as creating and selling our own designs often one-of a kind and runs we sell via bulk runs e-commerce and sell at various events products we sell on the website are made to order I need software that does four things number one tracks component apparel for example blank shirts hats hoodies Etc integrates with our Shopify store and accounts for component apparel used for each made to order sale creates barcodes and skews for oneof a kind of items sold at vending booths and tracks work in progress items for example a white t-shirt that was tie-dyed and will likely be used for embroidery later obviously I don't expect free software but something that costs $100 per month may be more than we can afford at this time but as the manager I may be able to convince the owner that paying that amount or more may be necessary so I think the op is saying don't expected to be free but $100 a month is too much if I'm interpreting this and some of these Reddit threads I'll admit are you know they they write things that are a bit unclear so we're trying to make an interpretation here most of the ideas in this video are focused on a vertical Niche this is not only apparel but it's custom apparel I really like vertical and orthogonal apps because they have a lot of advantages over the competitive blood bath that horizontal SAS brings but if I was going to do any of these I would personally try to lean into a competitive Advantage I have whether it's an existing Network or an audience or frankly just some experience or someone I know that's in one of these spaces you don't need that to start a sass I know so many Founders who've gone into spaces where they didn't have experience but in these tight vertical niches it is always helpful if you can possibly pile on your competitive Advantage when most of us are starting out we don't have a competitive advantage in any space so at a certain point you do just have to make a decision and move forward but the more experience you get the more ideas you try the more extensive your network obviously the more likelihood that you can find yourself with a competitive advantage in one of these spaces second idea is integrating ticketing systems across customers the op rights I'm reaching out to see how managed service providers or msps are managing the challenge of dealing with multiple external ticketing systems when the communication happens via email rather than API integration we work with clients who use platforms like top desk fresh service service now and others since there's no API integration in place all communication comes in the form of emails which are then processed in our own ticketing system this setup has proven to be a constant headache here are the core issues we're facing the first is email formatting incons consistencies external ticketing systems send emails in wildly different formats making it tough to parse and automate ticket handling consistently auto reply Loops it's all too common for auto replies to create endless loops with both systems firing responses back and forth this clogs up our system and creates a lot of noise manual ticket management despite efforts to automate we often have to manually merge responses assign tickets correctly or even identify duplicate tickets because the email integration is far from stable and the fourth is customization challenges even with customers specific configurations to handle emails better it's fragile one slight change in the external ticketing systems email Behavior can break the whole setup we've tried building rules and filters but they can only go so far the entire process feels duct taped together and I can't shake the feeling there must be a better way and maybe just maybe if you know what an MSP is the better way might be you building some software but first of course it would be some type of validation is anyone else searching for this do you see any other threads anywhere on Kora on stack exchange do you see any Google uh keyword search is for this type of tool or do you just see red threads can you do cold Outreach to folks who are in the same position as this person because one person's need does not define a market but if the need is desperate enough and enough people have it and you can get into conversations with even a handful of folks who share this same pain this may be something you want to tackle idea number three is an Erp for small manufacturing facilities so the op paraphrased writes we have a small dietary supplement manufacturer in the US about 30 employees and we need to upgrade our system to a unified Erp we manufacture things like you would see at GNC health pills and electrolyt so it's like vitamin stuff we use a system of QuickBooks and lots of spreadsheets and some third-party apps but managing them and syncing them even with automation is too much there aren't the software controls or permissions available to know when someone has done something accurately or at all so that's one main reason for going the Erp route some of the pain points are traceability every ingredient that comes in needs to be traced all the way through what it's used in and to whom it gets shipped to number two is change order requests to work orders number three is accurate costing with regards to loss yields and scrap and the fourth is processing adjustments for example adding flow agents and Manufacturing processing AIDS and accounting for that due to ambient environmental conditions I'm looking for Erp recommendations I was considering business Central either through a Microsoft partner or the apti and build on but I'm just not sure if that's the right fit and Opie goes on to write so concerns they have about existing options and they wrap up with it's important to have apis for us to be able to extract data for business intelligence and other automations with third party tools and to share across Shopify and other custom ordering portals we created for clients it's not the sexiest business but I like really boring B2B SAS because most people don't want to get into it and you can charge a lot for it I've never built an Erp I've never used an Erp but I know what one is and if you want to get into this type of space the big upfront task would be to do some type of validation you start with your 2-hour validation of research online looking at keyword tools looking at all the places that people hang out is anyone else have this type of problem then think about your 20-hour validation which is Outreach and talking to folks who might have this problem as well as potentially building a landing page and sending people to it and then of course 200 hour validation If You Get There is building the MVP in this case you're building an Erp it's not going to take 200 hours it's going to take a lot more so this would be a case of two 20 and then something more than 200 to get an MVP in people's hands this is a type of software that you would need to charge a lot of money this is not a $50 a month $100 a month app you're going to need to be really digging in you're going to be thinking 10 20 40K a year to provide this level of sophistication and power that this op is looking for and if you look at any of the competitors the op mentioned they're all very very expensive if you're not quite ready to build a standalone SAS like an Erp here's something you should consider building a Marketplace app I recently sat down with sneer alof who launched four apps on the monday.com marketplace and within a year he's already at $30,000 in monthly recurring Revenue in our conversation he broke down his exact process for finding and validating these micro SAS ideas you've heard me talk about this before app marketplaces make fantastic first businesses because you're not starting from zero since you've got a built-in customer base take monday.com for example they've got over 225 th000 customers across more than 200 Industries and 90% of their large paying customers have at least one app installed if you wanten familiar monday.com is a multi-product platform that runs all core aspects of work business owners and teams of all sorts use it to streamline their work using their Work Management CRM service and Dev products if you want to follow sne path monday.com has put together this detailed ebook that's essentially your customer research Playbook it breaks down their core User Group typical job titles specific pain points and how these customers are actually using the platform it's basically months of customer research hand it to you on a silver platter to grab your free copy just head over to the link below fill out a quick form and sign up for your developer account big thanks to monday.com for sponsoring this video now let's dive into our next Idea Idea number four is client portal for a retail in-person business brick and mortar the op writes I need a software platform or website integration that allows us to solve a few things for our customers mainly the customer experience and satisfaction from having a One-Stop shop for their order or service they want we don't have inventory everything we sell is custom ordered 1 to 1 and A2 years out is not uncommon items are sourced from all over the globe and sold in the US we also offer consulting services to clients in the same field this requires deliverables the client portal should have and the op writes a lot of bullets I'll read the first three or four but you can reference the post if you want the first one is a login portal with order or service detail second is approval process workflow with contracts to sign by the client Po and invoicing file management for documents and pictures integration with Dropbox is fine and then you know there's seven eight nine 10 more bullets that you can reference if you're interested in this one the op wraps up above are some of the features I would like some I'll have to rely on API connections from other systems do you want to build software for Brick and Mortar businesses I don't know could be an untapped Market or could be a problem that only this one person has or could be a very small Market as with all these ideas they haven't been validated we've just encountered problems on the internet this is the very tip of the spear in terms of doing research online to find real problems that real businesses are experiencing and in theory these real businesses should be willing to pay for that's the seed of a great startup Idea Idea number five is a simple M media Asset Management mostly videos and at the least for one person content creators simple budget friendly we tweaked this original post to make it easier to read but the op writes I'm a solo content creator who's wasting too much time sifting through b-roll or having to re-shoot footage because I can't remember what I have I spent hours yesterday going through various options kyn though it's dead now edit ready and I'm currently trying out vidue vidue isn't bad though it's very clunky they're a tiny team and don't update enough so necessary features aren't being added and it sometimes creates additional workflow my other option was to pay for an advanced MacBook finder and just tag and write descriptions the op wants it to be available offline to manage one to two existing hard drives to ideally be a one-time solution ooh not a subscription no see I would V I would personally be vetting does anyone else willing to pay subscription the the op has talked a lot about it being simple and budget friendly and usually that's a real recipe for a high churn high demand like I want this to do everything for $20 a month or $200 one time it's tough so I'm honestly not a huge fan of this idea but we obviously want to surface it so you can see the kinds of things that are available out there and the problems that people are looking to solve and I have one more idea for you but before I get into that if you're wondering how to find and validate SAS ideas you should check out the SAS Launchpad it is the best course I've ever created it's more than 9 hours of in-depth lessons covering the entire Journey from idea conception to product launch you can get a free sample module it's 28 minutes of content called the DNA of a great SAS idea to just get a little taste of how good this course is I've never released it anywhere else and if you go to SAS launch pad. and click the start free button you can download that today all right let's dive in to our sixth and final idea for this video it's a museum cataloging app the op is looking for a museum cataloging app that's price accessible for small historical societies the main one Past Perfect is over $1,000 and does not have full mobile capability so my question is that $1,000 a month or a year cuz if you want something for less than $1,000 a year man it better be self- serve it better be crazy simple and it better not need any new features it should be feature complete after you know months of development back to the op's post even though it's a one-time purchase Oh no this is another one this is this is so interesting and this shows you as you walk through ideas on the internet to pay attention to this kind of stuff you're hearing my my commentary as I'm I'm going through it of seeing o this is a pitfall that I wouldn't want to sell to this particular Customer because if they want to pay one time I'm not interested I'm in to build a subscription business and so as you do research and look for ideas you're going to pick up on these little yellow flags that I'm trying to point out to you so I hope hope they're helpful I'm going to continue with the Ops post even though it's a one-time purchase a lot of groups don't have spare computers lying around or can't access their whole facility from One desktop computer and then you need cameras an app that volunteers could download to use their own mobile devices and upload to a central database would help beyond measure an annual or monthly subscription would be ideal oh here we go so the person is is open to a subscription something where it measured the number of users accessing at once versus how many devices because volunteers come and go yeah so just I'm jumping in here you would want to do like monthly active users so you don't do named users you would say however many users were active in a given month or given quarter probably a month um then the pricing would be based on that back to the op's post it would just need to be database in items with a few different options that could export to a spreadsheet as needed and a place to upload photos skipping down to the end past perfect is the most affordable reputable professional grade software top level institutions seem to have custom IT solutions there's a few other pieces of software on the market but the last one I saw quote for had a package in the $3 to $5,000 range which is about double the discretionary spending budget at most places I volunteered if an affordable solution exists it's not being marketed well to small and medium nonprofit history organiz ations obviously this is pretty Niche but according to the American Association for state and local history there's between 3, and 4500 Historical Society museums spread across the us as always your mileage may vary do more research but it's interesting that this person actually went from one time to saying I'd be willing to pay a subscription I hope you enjoyed my walkth through of those ideas today that we found out in the wild on the internet and I hope you'll like And subscribe if you enjoyed the video if you're interested in learning how to find more sass ideas like these go
