================================================================================

[Music] [Applause] couple years ago before I got into this world I ran internship programs anybody ever worked with interns before or ever hired and turns before okay so when you have interns you're working with folks who don't know your world honestly they don't really know much of the real world at all they come into your company they don't know who to talk to what they're supposed to do they don't know anything and what the first time I hire these interns it's a disaster we didn't have them set up for success we didn't give them any tools they needed to succeed so what we decided was true on board them we decided wouldn't it be better when people have more of a successful time with us if we gave them the tools that they needed very simple things like this is where the copier is this is where you need to bang on it when it doesn't work and this is what I want to talk about with you today we call it onboarding but it's really helping people get started and helping set them up to be successful with what we're doing now of course we do have to address this elephant in the room that this is micro conscious tartar a lot of us don't have ideas a lot of us don't have products crazy to think about onboarding before you have someone that something to onboard someone want you I will argue my thesis for our time today is that no not only is it not crazy to think about this now today before you even built anything but doing it will give you a huge advantage because so many of your entrenched competitors so many of the other upstarts will wait to do this so many people will wait to do the things that you need to do for onboarding until they've actually done something so we're going to talk about why people start using your product and then stop just some of the talks earlier today those everyone who buys a course then never actually reads it same thing happens with software people come in and they leave they don't do anything why we're gonna talk about the information that you need to send people emails to bring them back into your product we're going to talk about how to turn that information into emails this is a little bit copywriting a little bit user research a little bit customer success because that's what onboarding is it kind of touches on all of these different so when we think onboarding a lot of times we're thinking about something like this it's large complicated branching logic trees they're one component of onboarding you have your in-app messages you have your demos but when you people leave your product and you want them to come back you send them emails that are on something like this and it's really scary and complicated this is a behaviorally triggered sequence how do you get people to do things how do you know what you should make them do how do you figure out what to put in the actual emails how do you set it up so that it doesn't explode and everyone thinks you're sending them 15 emails a day because you want to if I mistake there's a lot that it can go wrong it feels like this feels like poking your eyeballs out to get the information to solve the problem but it doesn't have to so we're gonna talk first about what people do when they come to your product and why they stopped solving why they try to stop solving their own problems which is what they're doing they're not here because they love software don't really want software they want problem solved so when they stop using our software they stop using our product they're stopping the process of solving their own problems and I will argue that the biggest reason for this is the mismatch between the journey that your customer expects to take and the one that we force upon them so this is what we expect when we learn anything new you want to learn calculus you wanna learn copywriting you want to learn how to do advanced mountain climbing it's like climbing a mountain you start at the bottom you're unhappy and you're gonna get to the top and it's gonna be hard it's not easy to climb mountains but we do it anyway and when things are going well when we're having these tiny wins little successes we're feeling like okay maybe there's a nice little view over there we see some floral and fauna and things are going well we're making progress and we keep going forward because we're making that progress and eventually we get to the top the mountain there's great view but this is what most of us do the mountain has cobras and there's some scary clowns which is probably the scariest thing you can see on a mountain right there's a scary clown and what happens is that when we have this kind of experience what we're doing is making it harder for people to solve the problems we can we do things that actively make it more difficult for people to get started and throw up these roadblocks we're gonna talk about some of them I call it he didn't work the reason I call it hidden work is because we saw the the map or the mountain where there's the work that people expect to do you make your you may make your new customers whether they're software or info product customers do more work that is not essential to helping them solve their problem so when you force them to stop and figure out how to do it when you just dump them in without any help even if it's a book and it seems like it has some health when you're forcing people to become more of an expert on your product then you might even be before they can even get started and do the first thing this is all hidden work and we want to get rid of it we're gonna talk about I want to show you three examples I think that's what's coming next pretty sure that's what's coming next of emails that you may have gotten in your inbox emails that may be the reason that you think email doesn't work emails bad emails dead email something we shouldn't do because there's a lot of ways that you can send emails to people that create all this extra work and this is part of the product centric work later on we're going to talk about all that internal work that stops people from solving their own problems so this is easier I called this one the vacation photos approach it's like holding someone hostage so when you're starting to think about your new customers you may not have your products yet you may not even be at that point but if you are I want you to think about how you can make it easier to get started then forcing someone to watch a 22 minute overview of your video how many of you have what sat down and will been invited to watch a 22 minute video and have watched the whole thing start to finish okay and yet this is a chat I had with a customer text analysis tool I'm looking for a text analysis tool if anyone has any good recommendations let me know and this was the best help I could get how's it go watch this 12-minute video or user-made go watch this 22-minute video that we have no one could tell me how to upload my data so that I could get it into the product that's all I wanted to do and this is the own answer so when we create these onboarding experiences when we don't make it easy to get started it's like poor making someone watch your vacation photos before you let them eat the deviled eggs that's the analogy it's like the old timey thing we don't do it anymore and put everything on Facebook there's also the too much too soon approach so when we send people emails and we say there's each one of these blue bars is a call to action that I have blacked out when we send people emails that ask them to do a lot lots of times they do nothing there's a lot of excellent studies on decision fatigue and choice overload we won't spend too much time on it but when you give people lots of options that does not increase the likelihood they will take you up on them this is the worst one of all when you sign up for a new product and someone says hey how can I help it's like no man you know their product why don't you just tell me the kind of help that I need instead of making me figure out what kind of questions I could even have to use a product and this is what your prospects inbox looks like they're getting six tips please to read documentation sending people to making people choose between looking for the problem they have in help video or a blog people are signing up with a problem that they want to solve there's a job they're hiring your product to do and if you don't make it easy for them to find it will they do it I don't know I mean I don't think so only the people who are really the most committed right I want you to contrast that with this beautiful email from harvest now before you say Oh harvest I've heard of that it's a probably can't do a lot with it sounds like it's a simple project management app you can do a lot with harvest you can convert currency you can manage your team manage your team's time you can add clients manage clients you can do a lot but you cannot do anything until you create a project so when you sign up for a trial with harvest you get an email sent right away that's asks you to sign in and create a project because until you do that you cannot move forward so when you're starting to think about how you're going to bring your customers on board to your product I want you to start to think about what that one action could be which brings us to how the heck do you figure out what that action is what do people need to do before they get started there's a lot of different tools that you can do use to find the data that may lead you to a conclusion about what you might ask people to do Clairsville entrap is one of the cofounders of userlist which is a great behavioral tracking tool for companies like us that are nice and small that might not be ready for something like a KISSmetrics and when you're looking at how people use your product you can look at how people use your product when they upgrade to a try upgrade to a paid plan at the end of their trial and what people do when they don't and ideally you want people to more people to do the good things then to do what people who don't do so this is how you can start to figure out what the actions are now if you don't have a product yet how do you do this how do you figure it out and to that I will say you will never stop onboarding you will never stop optimizing you never stop looking at how people are using your product and this is one of the one of those unfair advantages that you have now starting today being able to say we have our product we have an idea of how people might use it our initial first steps what they might be but we're not going to stop and say this is how it always has to be this is the definite next path we're going to set up our onboarding and leave it and forget it the way that many folks do this is a very overlooked part of the customer conversation I don't like the the funnel so when you start to say okay what might people what might we ask people to do you can start to get into a mindset we're going to be experimenting and giving people multiple paths for work so when you know what you want people to do this scary email sequence doesn't look like that looks like this so I want you to look at when you think about all boarding emails and how you're getting people back into your product I want you to think about something that looks like this each square represents an email each column represents an action you are asking people to do with the emails in that column for example you might have a three things that people are more likely to do before they upgrade this there's a lot of great research on case studies on how Wistia did this and they have three actions they need people to do and they send people emails to get them to do those actions before our sales enablement sequence so when you are sending these emails you may be thinking oh my gosh Ally that's 28 emails are you insane and of course not we don't want to send people 28 emails not what I'm advocating when you're setting up your behavioural triggers you want people to get the emails inviting them to complete the action that you need them to do or that will help them be successful and then you can bump them on to the next sequence so everyone is only going to get some emails that's the easy parts onboarding getting people to come back in and solve problems that they have started to solve and then at some point decided they no longer want to solve is about overcoming some other things some internal work it's just chatting with Dave Collins in the hallway and I told my get your emails all the time and I can tell by the subject line that this is like I'm doing a lot of things wrong with my SEO and it's going to be a lot of work to get started so for me I've got this internal blocker I want what he's selling I know what he's advocating I should do but in order to get to a point where I'm ready to do it I have this internal work we have a lot of different kinds of internal work we may say we don't have enough time we may actually have very little time where we may just not feel like something's a priority your prospects may not feel like the problem that they want to solve is a priority even though they've already expressed that it is they may get distracted I know I'm always about three clicks away from Serious Eats and stalking my pantry and coming up with new recipes so we have all these different things that we people are happy that's happening in people's internal psyche that we need them to overcome so that they can be successful so we can help them get on board how do we do that Claire gave a great talk yesterday about this idea of jobs to be done research it's a product development methodology originally and you can use jobs to be done research to look at the job someone hire your product to do this is completely different than a user persona if you're thinking oh I want to help developers this is not the same thing as that this is about saying I develop errs we'll hire my product to do better marketing because they have a product that they want to sell what is the job at someone's hiring to do and more specifically what's the job they hire you to do in the moment when they hire you a lot of times if you have a product where you have one stakeholder and one or one stakeholder who's using it and then someone else who is responsible for paying for it you need to get some buy-in somewhere so the job someone may need your software to do may not be to use your software to solve the problem that it solves it might be that someone needs buying it might be that the first thing that you send in an onboarding sequence is to say here's the scripts that you can send your boss a lot of conferences do this right they say here's the script you can send your boss if you want to if you want them to pay for you to come here conference so it's not going to be whatever that job they're hiring you to do it's not going to be that they don't know how to use your product this is not their biggest pain they may hate other products and they made heat software this is not the biggest pain that they need to overcome so now we're going to talk about the first thing that you can do to a answer this question and be build your first very basic onboarding sequence the email that Justin mentioned that Joanna we've talks about is where you send someone an email that just says hey what's going on in your world is a goldmine of data so when you set up your landing page in your email form the first email that goes out can say what's going on in your world what led you to try and sign up for this product and then you can respond to those new folks this is something that groov did and they got like a 40 percent response rate they wrote about it on their blog lots of people coming in so how do you what you have as a young company is a big advantage that you can actually start to build these relationships as we're talking about this morning to have more of a conversation with your customers from the beginning it's a lot harder when you have 60,000 signups than when you have 200 okay oh and this is proof it works I asked this question and I get on my email I have a free course that I have on my site and I get a lot of great responses and this is how I know that user onboarding might be something you care about even though we don't have our products ready so how do you know though like how do you know when you're listening to people what it is what they're saying like what's the meat of it what's the thing that they really want to do what's the why behind all of it and one of the things that I love to do is to look for outcome based phrases just like Justin said I want to have a product so that I can this is what you can start to listen for when you're doing your customer research so when you go to forums when you go to Reddit or go to your industry forums LinkedIn when you're doing your customer interviews listen for what people say after they say I want a I don't know I want an invoicing software so that I can look really professional when I semi invoices because Microsoft Word just isn't enough where I want to text analysis tool because I want to be able to look at how people how common phrases are and I don't want a giant data science platform that I have to watch 22 minute videos just off Adams started to touch on how you catalog your research this is a big challenge where do you put it all these are three tools that I recommend our story is free writing software by Joanna Wiebe you can use it to clip all the research that you find when you're out on the web and you can use it to write whatever you're going to need to write nomnom is a tool that you'll use if you already have our product you can aggregate customer feedback and you can do searches for outcome-based phrases after people have already been talking to on Zendesk or drift and you can use usability hub to get some really good feedback on the messages that you think you're working on the sales page that might be a good start it's a good way to get a nice little test of the water this is one of my favorite tweets of all time look at all this great social proof from January from a UX researcher named Tanya snook and she wrote about UX theater and how in her industry she observes many people going through the seeder of UX research pretending to listen to customers I was chatting at lunch and someone said that there's someone in there a colleague of a colleague at another organization who will often say things like here's this quote and can we can we use this as a customer quote without actually talking to the customer this is rampant this happens in many many situations and the more that you can I can still hear me with the adjustment tip to the microphone a little bit yeah okay good the more that you can get in a situation now where you're starting to listen to the problems your customers have were you're actually listening to them on an ongoing basis not oh it's you know I put onboarding as something to worry about in September its September I'm going to worry about it then I'm going to move on the more that you're listening to your customers and the problems that they have on an ongoing basis never stopping the better off you're going to be and the more that you start this now this is your advantage now is that you're going to have a better organization that is founded on listening to customers because if you wait if you wait until you have been around for a while if you say you know I just want to focus on getting a quick getting as many acquisitions as I can all this onboarding sounds great but it sounds like maybe I'm not ready for it Ali let's just get people my product is probably pretty good if you wait to do this and you continue to build an organization of one or two or three what you have is no longer a strategic problem or an operational problem or a marketing problem you have a cultural problem and cultural problems they're hard that's what we're all talking about when we're not on the stage is hi what's going on in our organization what's happening this is one of the reasons we even come into this world because we hated the cultural problems that we were dealing with in our day job the more that you can get your business set up on the right page to be listening to people truly and not going to the theater of it now today they're not for me so this is my favorite part now we're going to talk about how we can pull this all together and we're gonna I'm going to show you an email that I wrote so what does an onboarding email need to do it needs to help someone come back into your product after they've left because everyone's leaving right everyone we can have to agree that no matter how good your in-app onboarding is no one's building the Hotel California of products like everyone's leaving at some point and we want them to come back so to get them to come back we have to give them a reason why we have to help them overcome all of these internal hurdles I want to deal with my SEO problems right now I don't know if my boss is gonna give me buy-in on this then we have to eliminate that product centric work don't want to say hey how can I help you want to say here this is a step by steps instructions for what you need to do to solve this problem and at the end of every email we have one call to action only one we're not saying here's thirty five things that you need to do to get started we're saying here's the one thing you need to do in copywriting terms we might call this message matching at the top where we're matching the exact phrases that our customers have used voice of customer data when you're doing your research and you're listening to people you're seeing what people say you're getting those exact phrases those are giving you gold insights into what people are thinking then the instructions then the call to action ok great so this is a fictional product I have fictionally developed fans of the real show Arrested Development may recognize the very common industry problem for banana stand owners which is that there's this hard two-minute keep track of inventory because not all banana stand employees have the most excellent counting skills one banana doesn't always equal a buck so i fictionally did some research and i fictionally invented this fictional product called banana blaster and the the problem that it solves is that you can know where all your bananas are you know how many bananas you have it all the time but the job that banana stand mister managers hire me to do is to make sure that their employees are all on the same page with how much counting is involved with whether a banana equals a buck so training is really important so when we're designing our all boarding experience i'm not inventing in my own head oh okay why don't we walk through walk you through all the features that we have I'm not saying here's the sales data here's the purchase saying here's the inventory I'm saying I know that the main reason you're here is because you need help getting your employees trained up so when we put this in an email we want to start at the bot or start at the top yeah that's tough so the hardest thing about running a banana stand is you have to keep track of your bananas if your whole team is trained easier it's gonna be easier if your whole team is trained the same way it's going to be easier we're matched we're joining the conversation that's happening in someone's head right from the very beginning and then we're going to give them instructions here's how you can help your employees get started there's some pre written training materials we learned from our customer research that it's not enough to have an onboarding experience that says here's the training section we have to say here is the here's how you actually use the training section your employees to read it and then one call-to-action send those pre-written Docs to your team and here's what the email looks like so we start at the top we've got a subject line as the top of our email and this is exact phrase message matching from our fictional product research where our mr. managers say why can't my employees count this is a big problem we say no there's a lot of turnover and you never know if you can really trust your employees we're acknowledging that this is a real pain we're calling out the pain we're acknowledging it and we're saying okay we've got this new thing you can do this is how you can train team members it's called banana math and then right in the email we're going to put screen grabs that show us how to use the product it's not gonna make people go watch a 35 minute video we're going to just tell them how to do it this how you actually deliver your instructions will depend on what you learned during your research Val Keisler on Jane Portman's UI breakfast podcast mentioned a study I know that's like for it's like my cousins uncles brothers sister mentioned a study where they found that people who read a newsletter read it on the subway in New York City and if you send them a link to click on anything they're not going to be able to read it on this so you need to know how your customers are interacting with your product and it may be that you just need to put all the information in the email maybe you suddenly okay so does this work is it real my clients ask me this all the time they want to know does this work is this the way to do it and the truth is that you could probably run a hundred and fifty onboarding experiments before you get to those those real measurable wins when you're a large organization when you have that testing culture and that testing infrastructure in place you can keep running experience experiments and keep learning well when you are young and when you're starting out the most important thing that you can do is think about all boarding as helping people get started if your learnings if someone's never been to your product before and they have a problem just do everything that you can to help them get started and all of this other thing kind of like onboarding it's a technical kind of jargon a term that I'm not a huge fan of thinking about it as helping people can get started is going to give you more benefits than worrying about whether or not you should do the test you guys got that like the queen is dead long live the Queen right testing is dead long live testing okay good so but I am going to give you some results join the conversation happening in your customers head works this is an email that the Sophia Quintero the founder of ñam ñam shared with me it's a key study email you might want to share customer success stories adam had some great customer testimonials and his launch sequences so what after you've sent your launch sequences and you're helping people get started in your product even if they've already paid you money i'll show them how other people have been successful as long as they care you can't say okay you can say that there's 35 different ways you can use this product but that's not going to be as helpful as really joining the conversation happening in someone's head this is a really great case study about if you do happen to go read it and subscribe to it about how listening to customer research allowed the person who is using nom nom to cut down their activation requests because they've realized that a problem in their welcome email making it easy to get started works harvest has been sending this email for the past four or five years same email I got when I got started coral Edwards the Director of Marketing at harvest pointed out that it's been the same email for years this is also called the rule of one in conversion copywriting where you only ask people to do one thing at a time there's another study by whirlpool and that's in MarketingProfs where you they took out all the calls to action in a single email so there's only one and they got a 42 percent increase in click-throughs val Geisler who was an attendee speaker at growth and another onboarding optimization email boarding consultant she's a big fan of treating people like humans she likes to say treat people like humans not ATMs and talking to people like the real people gets really good results some of her stats is like 600 12% increase just by talking to people like they're humans so what we're talking about it's getting rid of the hidden work and starting to learn a new product and it works if you take nothing else away from this talk I hope you will take away that the most beneficial thing you can have for yourself is the right mindset like really just think about that you're teaching people something new you're solving their problems you're here to address their pains you're eliminating all of the hidden work that you may not even realize you're asking people to do so special thanks to all of the many people who volunteer to help and Mike Rob and sander as always for being so excellent and Justin I didn't realize he was going to be emceeing when I made the slide so yeah I have a free course in email course on my site that you can get with a little bit more about the how you do the behavioral analysis looking at the data every tools different but well it goes into a little bit more detail you can also get the slides at that URL and you can email me thank you all right great talk Ali who's got a question for Ali put up your hand nice and tall we'll try to get to a few the DS and the meantime can the attendee talk speakers come up here thank you all right hey yeah thanks I have a question so obviously when you're bootstrapping something it's all about trade-offs like what you put your time and effort into developing so do you have any advice for deciding what is sort of good enough for now that you can then build on later oh yeah they're doing when you're building onboarding like what how you do that incrementally versus just the perfect version of it so the the square the slide with the squares yeah thank you the top I call it the top of the sequence so I would never recommend saying no emails is your starting point no help is your starting point I would you're always going to be strapped for time if it's a matter of waiting to launch an extra week or two and having four emails I would say definitely do that if it's a matter of waiting to launch a month and a half so you can get your 28 emails so I call it the top of the sequence it's not ideal it's where you're sending emails out based on the actions that you you're hypothesizing are most likely the ones that people will take and you're tracking a lot of data on whether or not people actually take those actions whether or not that's what people tend to do so if right from the moment you launch if you can have that as a starting point I also recommend that what's going on in your world email I wrote an article about that email in particular and Joanna Reba and Lance Jones at copier at air story send this email out when they were first launching just saying hey what's going on in your world and they got a ton of valuable data so that's like the micro place you can have your beta and still have this one email and then once you've got like a little bit of data at the top of the sequence and then moving into the larger one later on this please yeah yeah focus on that the each one email for each action now and then you drill down now the reason that I recommend this and this is something that I go back and forth with myself maybe at the next micro off we can have some email marketers like go head-to-head in a conversion copy sequence battle of what we should do but the reason that I like this approach is because if for me I would rather get a little bit more advice on how the product works especially since we're you're not sure if it's if this is definitely the right action so that's the starting point but all of that said recognizing that you're at a starting point and make a building in all into all the other time that you're spending on your product all the customer research all the development of features building in time to continue to look at how people get started that would be my number one recommendation thank you alright Anna Lee we have another question over here thank you that was really informative I noticed that in your examples of the emails they were all plaintext emails with instructions and then a call-to-action we have noticed in our one-off campaigns that Playtex emails do a lot better people just engage with them the more they just respond to them better and our current onboarding series is not plain text emails because they have screenshots so I'm within this hard place where the screenshots are useful and like you know this is how you do it here's the step by step instruction but I also have noticed that plain text emails are just doing better and better because people are sick of the like you know like the MailChimp layout that like looks like MailChimp so I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on that for effective instructions effective instructions so when you okay great when you talking about plain text you're talking about screen grabs do you okay let's see where's that one let me get this will be easier with the visual of course it's the last one okay so when you're talking about is this what you mean when you say you're talking about plain text with screen graphs or do you mean something different and this isn't working for you but not for onboarding emails okay I coming is going to be a little bit different so if you're finding that one way of doing something is declining to our earlier conversation that might be another opportunity to run a test so I recommend plain text as a starting point you can maybe consider working your way up or you can test them side-by-side at the end of the day there's a lot of best practices and then there's what happens when you actually put it out there so I like plain text it works pretty well but if that's not working for you then fit shot does that answer your question okay okay cool all right we got another question right here yes hi Ellie thanks for your great talk so you kind of touched on two different ways of doing things the one was like what's up in your world kind of email yeah when you have a new customer or someone new and then there's also they're like this is the one called action to like you use my product yeah I'm kind of in the early stages of like a beta products how would you weigh those two like could you put those two calls of action into one email should there be two different emails or how do you try get both of those two pieces of information to the customer so you have a product that's in beta you see you you know you have an idea of what you want someone to do when they aren't your product yeah okay but I also am interested why they've signed up and how I can help them and I want to do more research to you and the email that you send asking people to do something is it behaviorally trigger triggered or is it a welcome email or it's a welcome email to welcome you know and right now has both things know right now it just says this is how you step one yeah yeah I would do two personally because you can evaluate the results of each one separately and because it follows that rule of one you're only asking people to do one thing at a time I know if you get an email that says hit reply and also go to this other screen then you're doing your shopping list or you're finding you're next to Airbnb for your vacation so that's what I would recommend and keep it full nice and tightly focused cool thanks alright is there any other questions oh one more okay well do one more hi hi great points when I think of onboarding I also think about the instructions that you give within an app mm-hmm how would you contrast that with giving instructions via email and which is more efficacious it's not an either-or you want both so the in-app instructions are great for when someone's in your product but as soon as they leave they don't have those instructions anymore so what I like about putting the instructions right in the email is that it's priming people for what they're going to do so that they know if you had just because you had in-app instructions when you were in your product before and then you leave and you come back maybe the same tutorial is not available you don't know how they set it up so I like having the extra instructions so that you can like make sure people are getting them I would absolutely have them working together the second thing is that very often an in app tutorial happens when you sign up I don't know about you guys I do a lot of late-night reading and I sign up for trials midnight when I'm not ready to actually start using the product just kind of sign up for it cuz I know in the morning I will have forgotten that I was reading this article by this cool person so I'm what happens to me then where does the information go so you want the in app tutorials but you also in theme us that answer imperfect thank you sure all right thanks so much Allie thank you everyone you
