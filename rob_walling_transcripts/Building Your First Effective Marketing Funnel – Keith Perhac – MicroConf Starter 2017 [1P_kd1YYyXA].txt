================================================================================

[Music] all right hello hello I am Keith Eric otherwise known as Patrick's Keith it is true we did live next to each other in Japan about 12 years or so as you can kind of see here I've done a lot of stuff I run a marketing agency called Elfie net which horrible naming choice no one in America can either spell or pronounce it so we're kind of rebranding currently I am also the founder of seg metrics which is a SAS that we built out of our consulting agency and it does analytics and then summit evergreen which also it does online courses also built out of our agency um so what do I do I design strategies that turn visitors into customers that's a really fancy way of saying that I build email funnels so I help companies essentially build a landing page for an offer that gets their email address that sends them through a bunch of emails and turns them into a customer hopefully somewhere down the line I have lived 13 years in Japan and nine months ago I moved to Portland it is a huge huge difference from living in Japan I realized that my entire adult life has been in Japan so I not only had to get used to living in America again but also taxes business registration just how things work in this country the people I work with you probably know some of these mixergy front-end masters I will teach to be rich Evan pagan junior positive applause a bunch of people you can see on here a couple of enterprise a couple of SAS we mainly work with info product people those are people who are personality based brands that are trying to sell either coaching or courses or something similar all right this is important when I get excited I talk really really fast it is taking all my willpower now to talk at this speed I am going to try to stay at this speed for the rest of the the talk marketing excites me more than pretty much anything else my team can attest to whenever we get onto a strategy call or something they generally have to record it and listen afterwards at half-speed because otherwise there's no way to even take notes this is one her percent jaw Josh who did a presentation yesterday said I was telling him that I was 47 slides in he said that that's about three minutes of actual time that's probably true where it slides six now and I've been talking for three minutes all right I do talk fast there is a lot of information on the slides the slides are available develop your marketing comm slash micro comm pipe in 2017 that is also at the end so you also have that URL again I just don't want you to be trying to write down everything that's on these slides because it's it will be impossible all right let's get started what we are going to talk about today is building your first effective marketing funnel so a lot of you are as we saw on the graph yesterday our pre product or have just started your product probably don't have a very solid email marketing campaign or any sort of marketing funnel to get people on to your site and to start buying your product all right so we're gonna go through essentially from top to bottom a why is this important B what should you be doing and see some very specific steps on how to accomplish those all right so the end goal get visitors on your list and turn those visitors into customers all right so first thing I want to talk about is why our email funnel is important if you're in micro coffee you've probably been hearing for the last seven years that emails are important and it's kind of funny because you you go on to hacker news you go on to all these sites and they're like oh you know marketing is dead it's so saturated it's horrible you'll never make any money if you try to do an email campaign here's a bunch of examples from that this one's my favorite this is from Fast Company from 2000 I think that's seven and that's three years before I even started doing email marketing so and now email marketing honestly is hands-down one of the most important marketing funnels that I see in any business whether that SAS or personalities products anything email marketing is incredibly important and the reason for that is that emails give you personality right there's only so much personality you can have on a website especially for a SAS app you're not going to be able to connect with someone over a long period of time to develop that personality to develop that trust right and that's what emails get you is a long-term communication channel with someone to develop your personality all right personality goes a long way everyone know who this is yell it out Dave Thomas who is he the founder of Wendy's right this is a face that people know and connect to you instantly knew who this was this one's a little bit more tough do you know who this one is Major Nelson that's right Xbox and you remember this one guy on the left the middle one not so much Jerry that is there's an 80 kid 80s kids reference this is Howard Phillips he was the head of Nintendo for my entire childhood now it's Mike fella me I believe but essentially this guy was such a big part of the Nintendo brand to my generation that they actually had a comic that was in Nintendo Power every month and we followed the exploits of Howard and Nestor and absolutely loved it and it connected us to the brand so what are these these are large corporations that are letting customers connect with a human face right we tend to trust people more than we trust companies all right we saw that yesterday with some of the the opt-ins where we want faces people trust faces they trust people because they're like us if you say Exxon not much trust there right who's the face of exon exon doesn't really feed back into my into my life in a pleasant way all right who's this right in who's this Zelly not robert downey jr. who is this lars who's this Elan who's this Neil Patel all right so all of these people have use their personality have used their brand have used that connection that you have with them in order to build a brand to build a product and to build a business all right Elon Musk especially out of there when he was in PayPal not many people know of him now his face and his name is a brand on itself as PayPal at SpaceX is Tesla right it's now the Hyperloop as soon as that gets off the ground all right these are faces that put a human element that we can now connect to and we get trust from just from knowing hey this person did something that was amazing that we believe in and trust we're gonna trust him on the next thing that they do communication from a person is more of compelling than from a company companies don't give a crap about you people do even when you're working with support even with you when you're working at retail the person you are interacting with has a chance to connect with you has a chance to do something for you to help you a company as a as an amalgamation does not help you here's one of my email list this is my promotions tab in Gmail you can see kind of who I remember all the names that are being used to to promote brands alright one of these is Brian from Sam cart I don't even use Sam cart but I remind I remember Brian and since I have push notifications on my phone every about every day or so I get a message from Brian I don't think I've read many of them because I don't use Sam cart but I know who Brian is and if someone come up to me and said hey I'm Brian from Sam cart I'm like oh I know exactly who you are it's kind of like watching a watching a movie Empire Records for example back in the 90s great movie absolutely wonderful defined a generation at least that's what everyone told me I actually have not seen Empire Records but I remember it as if it was really good and I've actually had this conversation with friends people would be like oh man have you seen Shrek and I was like oh yes such a great oh no now I haven't seen it yet everyone saying it's great but I don't know it's that repetition right is that repetition I know Brian I don't know Brian but I don't and if he came up to me I have some level of connection and trust alright let's go back to Lars so I met large for the first time I think about three years ago at micro Kampf Europe and when I met him I felt like I already knew him because he sent me eight months of emails from KISSmetrics he was essentially the face of KISSmetrics in my inbox every single day every single week for eight months so when I met Lars I was predisposed to like him right I know who he is if Lars asked me for a favor sure whatever Maci's asked me for a favor no because even though I have the exact same connection with Lars at that point that I did with Macy's it's not a person there's not someone that I'm talking to that's having a conversation with me when I first met Lars it was like hey you're the guy from KISSmetrics I read your stuff that's awesome we now have this connection all right a little bit of story time so I read a lot of emails I am on a lot of people's email lists people email me for various things either because they're automated they want to sell me stuff or because we want to get our podcast we want to do something Brennan got me to respond to a canned email because I thought it was real and like I said I get a lot of candy mails and he was able to convince me and I responded and he's like key that was automated I'm like crap got me and then one of my other friends who will remain nameless asked me to be on his podcast about three or four times and finally he pings me and slices his teeth why aren't you answering my messages I was like oh crap I thought those are automated I'm sorry man I would love to be on your podcast I might want to work on your content writing a little the key is having good content we've heard this multiple times in micro Kampf from some really good speakers really good strategies on how to write good content content is still key the face makes it more relatable right let's do an example here is Neil Patel this is what he has on his website from aha - oh crap I am sharing everything on my journey to 100,000 monthly visitors that sounds like a good proposition that's Neil Patel I know that he's starting over I know that he's been successful I know that he will share things with me because I have trust in him what Starbucks said that which one do you trust more I don't trust I don't care about star buy Starbucks is not in my wheelhouse I have no connection to Starbucks yeah you got a hundred thousand visitors you're a multi-billion dollar company who cares all right Neil Patel has a connection to me through his marketing through his personality that I then trust to be able to help me all right so where does this come in to a marketing funnel all right I've kind of talked about why this is important so one thing I want to check who is doing SAS versus who is doing products and when I say products I mean things that are more personality based privatised consulting or info products so I'd like all SAS people raise your hand even if you're still free all right there we go okay all the product people please raise your hand that is much more even than I thought I thought it was gonna be 80/20 heading towards SAS I was wrong it looked like a little bit more maybe 55 60 % SAS everyone else's product that's awesome alright so I want to talk about why I want to ask that question what's important about that and the difference is what type of connection you can make with your customers products are easier to create an emotional connection with and SAS is easier to commit to create an educational connection with they're both possible ones just easier than the other all right we all know this slide we've seen this slide so many times you've your product you're not selling your product you are selling a better version of your customer that's why people buy your product they want to be a better version of themselves I would take that one step further and say that in a lot of cases people want to be a better someone in this case Luigi wants to be Mario right Mario is of course the good brother Luigi's mom forgets his name all right and it's really true we all have people that we're looking up to and just as Justin was saying we all have heroes all right one of the reasons that the talks here they kind of have inspirational half tactical is because it's important to know where you want to go and it's important to have a role model that you can then strive towards alright so these are three of my role models that I've had throughout my career slash life Stanley I want to be a cartoonist for the first twenty two years of my life that did not work out the second one is Dave Spector he is a newscaster in Japan and for a long time he was my rival both for Japanese and for integrating himself into Japanese society I still find him somewhat of a rival but I've pretty much given up and then ramita Sadie who I worked with for four or five years and really inspired me even more now with my agency on how to build how to market and how to run a company in a smart way that also is very I will say moral and integral to have a to not sell out to the to the dollar right even though his site is called I will teach you to be rich it's probably the most solidly teach you how to live a rich life and not take shortcuts cite that I've worked with and his business practices are similar so I strive a lot to build my company in my life in a similar way alright so again why is this important because your audience is looking up to someone they are looking for the answer and it's easier to get the answer from someone rather than something so who does your audience look up to the goal is really to have them look up to you you're the expert right you want to prove that your SAS your product whatever you are offering to them is able to solve their problems because you are the expert and you walk through it all right so how do we do that well we walk people through what we call a nurture sequence all right so this is a drip workflow this works in anything in drip ontraport Infusionsoft MailChimp convertkit doesn't really matter the idea is that we are going to send people down a journey alright and we are going to teach them why it is that currently their life sucks and how we can make that better and what we can do to make that better and how we went down that same path as well the goal of the nurture sequence is to put people in a specific frame of mind alright so let's go through what's in the nurture sequence they're about four main steps the first one is called what I call priming the pump so this is something that you talk about the problem but not in over terms right so this is something let's talk let's say you are talking about salary negotiation and starting out before you even get into the sale sequence or anything maybe you'll talk about how hard it is to to make ends meet or what would it mean if you had another 500 dollars every month and just start having people think about the problem set this isn't saying oh my god your life is so horrible you need to get a solution now this is just having people start ruminating over some of the problems that you are then going to clarify on and then eventually solve the next one show the pain this is I I'm not sure if Amy who I coined this phrase or not but the pain dream fix this is the first part of that where we're essentially showing the absolute pain and the problem that we're gonna solve and we put it in very emotional terms of this is why it sucks this is why it's horrible why do you have to keep doing this oh my god everything is falling apart then you show the dream this is what it's like after you get over that this is what it could be if you solve these problems if you're spending 20 hours a week on payroll and budgeting and all the stuff and it's preventing you from building your product or getting to the next step what is it look like once you remove that pain and now you're able to focus on the things that are important to your business and finally you reveal the solution this is how you do it you do it by buying my product taking my coaching course using this SAS software alright you're real the solution and get them to start in on it I have a quick this was a two second example that I found a couple weeks ago absolutely loved it I was looking for some Gantt charts in Excel and they said hey here is a great way to go through Excel here's a 30 step process it'll take you about 30 minutes and then you will have a single Gantt chart that you can then use and I looked at that I was like oh crap or I could just pay whatever money this is and get it automated for me every single time I click a button which one do you think wins all right that's a and I think an email sequence should go further but this is a great example of pain dream pain is oh my god I got to do this for 30 minutes the dream is I can click a button it's done the fix by that software all right so what does a new trainer Chur sequence actually look like so we're going to go through three main types two of them I recommend one is not so recommended but if you don't have time it's better than nothing all right so first one is a hero's journey so a hero's journey is just like the Joseph Campbell idea this is what the it's a myth archetype this is how Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and everything is built around it's the idea of you have someone who is called to action in this case has a problem and walks you through their pain their success and then coming out on the other side is horribly successful usually in the hero's journey the hero is you who runs the product or a face man for your company or someone else that the customers or the readers can see themselves as to emulate and to understand the pain it's very much saying hey I have the software I'm not just a guy selling software I built this software because every single day was horrible absolutely horse egg metrics and we'll go into some of the emails the reason we built it is because my co-founder charlie was tearing out his hair because he had to spend five to six hours writing these reports for all of his clients every single report costs taking us about five hours he it's all exporting data into creating pivot tables and he came to me one day he's like Keith if I do this one more time I'm going to tear out the rest of my hair how can we fix this and so we built seg metrics and that's part of our nurture sequence that's part of our email sequence it's talking about you guys are doing this too you're exporting if you're getting the numbers you want to know you're exporting all this data you are spending so much time on this and they're just horrible or you could click a button and pay me $40 which one do you think you're going to choose all right next step is the the next type is an educational and a pain dream sequence so with this you are not you don't have a face you're not going through a narrative you're not going through a story arc this is essentially more tactical solid this works very well for SAS you can definitely do a hero's journey in SAS it's just a little more difficult you have to kind of work things a little bit better but this is a standard email sequence that you would see if you signed up for WP engine or some other SAS company where they are teaching you cute they are explaining pain points they are teaching you strategies and successes that will get you farther in life they are setting themselves up as an expert and gaining your trust over time all right last one weekly newsletter like I said I really don't recommend it but as all things it's better to have something than nothing if you don't have the time the inclination or even are able to get out one of these other two sequences in the near future I recommend doing a weekly newsletter just so you can stay up-to-date with the people on your newsletter all right so let's dive in a little so I'm going to talk about the hero's journey first we're going to talk about how we connect to someone on an emotional level I've talked about a couple of these so it's going to be a little bit of a rehash so I'll go a little bit quicker so the idea is you show your own situation and pain you explain how you are like them like your readers you connect with them I'm just like you you show yourself at the end of your rope very common in info product marketing I didn't know what to do I was beside myself I thought about throwing in the towel all right then you show that you conquered that pain all right you say and then I did a then I did B and then I did see and oh my god it was so much better and I wish that I had these things when I was at the bottom at the end of my rope I wish I had had someone to help me like I'm gonna help you and that's when you reveal the the solution all right very important reveal provide educational content in the framework of I wish I had this this would have been great this would have helped me get over it so much quicker all right you don't sell until the end the product has scarcity usually so the like I said for info products this is really good because you either are offering them a deal you close down the shopping cart afterwards you can only buy in the funnel the idea is that you are convincing people to purchase through scarcity for a sass a little more difficult but you can definitely offer things like will we'll do a one-hour consultation call for free if you sign up for this or you can do the annual plan sign up for the annual plan you get a discount all right this is actually really small on this tiny little monitor so it's hard for me to see but this is the nurture sequence that we kind of go through so in this nurture sequence we are starting off with I believe this has two people on it Tim and Mary yep so the idea here this is the classic hero's journey that we use in our marketing campaigns these are the actual emails and kind of what we position for each of them but the idea is that we take our the main hero which is Tim and we're going to tell his story and then we're going to tell the story of a another student who has a similar problem we call her Mary alright and we talk about both their problems how they're coming into it and we're making sure that they're coming in from different directions so whether your audience identifies with Tim or Mary they have someone to identify with then we're also talking about famous people who have had similar issues we're talking about people some of our students that have had issues we're putting together that pain and the idea that everyone has this pain right and that there is a solution and that we have the way out after about 16 days of these educational worming emails we go into a sale sequence for about three days we say hey this is the offer this is when it's going to end and we do about four emails with that so hey this is the the card is opening hey now it's closing by the way did you notice that we're closing the cart all one thing that's important that nurture sequence has no sales emails in it whatsoever we do not even mention we have a product we do not mention that we are going to sell anything it is 100% emotional and educational all right people smell a sale coming a long way away which is why we did that prime the pump as well we want to prove that we are the experts with no strings attached upfront all right the sales sequence is also educational but it has a very strong sales message in it a lot of especially the previous generations of internet marketers will just send out an email that says hey buy my stuff doesn't work that great they get away with it for maybe a couple more years on name recognition but honestly content and education is the name of the game right now and even your sales emails need to be full of Education and help all right that was the nurture sequence so let's dive into an educational funnel all right so this is a little bit more SAS oriented but the idea of this is to show yourself as the expert so instead of connecting on a purely emotional level and a hey I overcame this - you're going to show yourself as the expert right so there's kind of the sequences that Patrick puts together that I put together the idea is to just set yourself up as hey I know what I'm talking about I'm gonna teach you everything I know all right the key points here educate on topics that fit your audience show yourself as the expert put links to your products in all the emails there's no reason to not put people to the sales page or to get them started on the SAS because you are connecting on an educational and in more intelligent level intelligence bad word but a blanking on the word but not an emotional level all right we don't want to overwhelm with the bat off the bat so it's not like super by myself by myself by myself no it's all educational end of the email you say by the way this great software that we are providing helps you be a better designer or be a better writer or be a better whatever it is that you do you should sign up here all right targeted content is key for getting through the inbox noise everyone in their mother is doing I'll call educational content sequences 90% of them are pure crap and they are so generic because a lot of them get content mills or content factories just everyone knows they need an email list right so so many people just put out generic generic emails and so you want to make sure that your target that your content is targeted specifically at the people that you are looking to hit here's an example so a general content mill kind of subject line would be five quick end tax savings all right that's interesting I'm not sure if it applies to me versus five quick end tax savings for freelance developers even if I really know my tax stuff the fact that it's targeted directly to me freelance developers maybe there's something I don't know there's something special in there that apply specifically to me that doesn't apply to other people all right this has just increased the value of this email tenfold we had a business card company that we were doing some marketing emails for and we decided to do an educational sequence and what kind of educational sequence abilities so we thought about standard designer educational sequences and like color Theory color theories a good one but everyone knows color theory and no one's gonna open an email it's like five things you need to know about color theory right because they went to they went to art school assumably so we changed it up a little five things you need them about color theory for business cards no crap is there something different about business cards is there something that deals with printing and metallic and there is there is different stuff but suddenly I've created this hook I've created something that's different that can stand out and target specifically what I'm interested in I'm on this list I'm interested in printing business cards now I'm getting education that's gonna help me learn how to make better business cards all right here is another education sequence this one really freaking hard for me to read it is small I am NOT going to be able to read those to be honestly to be honest but these are a number of subject lines and then pages that they will go to sales pages information pages etc that is essentially here's what we're gonna teach you about and it has a good cadence it has a cadence of here's feature one here's feature two by the way with feature 1 did you know that this is also awesome here's someone else who used our product that made it absolutely amazing and we're just going to talk them through an entire funnel sequence all right I noticed that have 16 minutes left I'm gonna speed up tiny bit alright so here's an example so this is the seg metrics funnel we did a seven-day mix because like I said the Cobblers children have no shoes I do this all day for my clients and when it comes to my own sass I am a horrible horrible lazy bastard so we're going to go through this this is a mix of kind of emotional and educational the first one all the data you ever need this is a five minute guide to all the data that you need to get out of your CRM specifically Infusionsoft in this case how you get it out of there what you do to get that data and how you crunch it all day - we lied it's even easier than we say haha just kidding we don't use those words because that's kind of mean but we're essentially saying you know all that work you did wouldn't be great if you could just push a button have it done oh yeah hey push this button and it'll be done all right so this is how you take that one and a half hours you spent learning everything and do it in five minutes now the important thing about this is since they did it and learned it a they trust our numbers because they did it themselves and they saw that there the numbers were correct with their numbers - they know how much of a pain in the butt it is to do it all right so that gets it going even faster day three is an emotional email where we connect that same story that I told you about Charlie we were just fed up we were absolutely fed up with how hard it was to get solid numbers out so we built this talking about the pain and the dream all right day four this is our case study how entrepreneur on fire used our reporting and there's a case study of how one of our big clients or one of our big customers use the reporting in order to increase the revenue day5 is a tip about stop leaving money on the table this is more of hey did you know that you're actually losing money every month that you're not actually that you're not reporting on these numbers here's how to fix it and then day six is the final let's hop on a call so we're happy especially this was early stage happy to hop on a call with someone walk them through understand what they want to get out of the system what they are getting our system and why they moved away from our competitors which is really big all right how do you know what to write so now we've talked about why we do what we do we talked about the format of what we of what we're going to do with these email sequences so how do we know what to even write how do we know what our customer base is especially if we haven't if this is our first email marketing all right so we're going to take a quick trip down an actual customer acquisition marketing brainstorm such well those a lot of keywords at once and we're just going to kind of go through so I want to say thanks to Jordan Jordan this is a actual strategy call that he and my team put together go sign up for card hook because it is awesome all right so the first thing you need to decide is is this hero versus educational are we going to set up a personality a person as the front of this or are we going to do it from a more educational like let's learn and and we're going to be the experts kind of thing in this case we chose educational then we go through customer exploration like I said these are slot these are a little bit small but I remember a lot of these we're essentially saying who is the target audience this is your customer research this is things that you've seen from people getting contact with you talking with you before in this case we drove we turned it down into two main categories who we called the respectable retailers so this is people like Harry's or online brands jewelry that kind of thing people who want to be the next Dollar Shave Club or something like that who has a strong visual brand and wants to be a powerful online sales force the second one are what we call the marketing mavens marketing mavens they are more like internet marketers they are doing a ton of small products generally sub $50 more like $20 they are trying as much as they can they run something until it doesn't work anymore then they throw it all away and go on to the next thing a great example of this someone telling me I think here at micro Kampf they had a friend who was running a t-shirt company that during the election based on the number of candidates they were selling t-shirts for each of them and as each one was getting knocked off they were knocking off the t-shirts from their from their store right so as soon as Ben Carson dropped out of the race they removed all the ben Carson shirts so they even made a different version of it or something like that these are people who are trying to cash in on trends and it's much more marketing it's much more fast-paced they're not looking to build an overarching high quality brand they are looking to be very successful at business all right what we decided with these two is that the retailer's the marketing mavens are going to go after things that work the retailers are the ones who really need to be convinced through the quality of the product if the product works and gets sales the marketing mavens are going to come so we focused on the retailers in this case we're gonna identify drivers and we have a bunch we just listed these up all on the board this was about a two-hour session and we just talked about what problems are they trying to solve what keeps them up at night why does it hurt so much and what problems are they trying to solve and in this case we came across some things one is they are very very particular about their brand about their visuals about the whole experience that they're having with their checkout the second one is that they are happy to spend extra money to make sure that this company and this product is going to be there in a year or two years once they make a decision they're going to keep going into it all right then we go through and we brainstorm a lot of headlines all right generally we do around 10 sometimes 15 and these are all in order and afterwards when you reading the slides you can see that they kind of go in spurts so we'll we'll hit on a theme and then we'll keep repeating off the theme then we'll try a new one and none of these are really good copywriting that's not the point the point is not to have a finished polished headline it's to get those key values and those key points that we want to to leverage there and then we can go back after we pick the best ones that resonate and then make them a lot better all right and these are the things that work going to use for our landing pages for opt-ins and essentially this drives the whole conversation in the emails all right next one we're gonna get multiple eyes on it we're gonna have everyone in the company we're gonna get our friends we're going to get people look at this we're gonna have decided maybe the top three or four that we like are they the same ones that other people like if so then awesome we're on the right track if not why not what did we see in the brainstorming session that wasn't conveyed when someone who wasn't in that session saw right and that's very important once you're in a brainstorming session once you're in the circle you're like so excited like oh man this is the best idea ever you tell someone else like that sucks man man oh oh that's a stinker so you want to know that you want to know what is a new customer a new lead someone who's never seen this before gonna think all right last one build the flow just like what we talked about before all right so that's the whole email sequence so now that you know what the headline is we're going to kick that off we're going to riff off of that with our email sequence and start convincing people people on all right so now we have talked about why it's important to be a personality why it's important to be the expert why it is how to put together an email list and now we're gonna talk about how to actually get people on your list all right the best opt-in magnets are ones that get people quote started quick or answer the question do you have a problem opt-in pages that are commonly searched that are good keywords have a high SEO and they can get a lot of visitors and a high conversion rate so they're very good you can send paid traffic to them but if they're good enough they're also going to get a lot of SEO traffic which can convert organic leads into real customers all right this is probably the classic this is the WordPress speed test by WP engine this is one you put in your email address and you they run a PageSpeed very common Google does it ping tools does it and you get you're putting your email address and you get the results as well as I believe it's a 28-day nurture sequence that is all educational all right this is the one for sig metrics you connect your Infusionsoft account and we will give you a business score on a couple of key metrics are you getting more leads are you making enough money is your trends going up or is it going down very solid sends them into the seven-day warming sequence this one is freakin brilliant I wish I had thought of this this is an anxiety test so this is for anxiety coaching and I believe some supplements as well this is just the DSM DSM V for self-assessment test made as a quiz I am not allowed to actually give out the numbers here but a similar quiz that we did for the health niche was getting around 20,000 leads per month all organic they were converting at around 65% and each lead was worth a dollar eighty from organic traffic so after they went through the nurture sequence at the end of the day they were making a dollar eighty so that's what almost thirty eight thousand dollars per month from organic leads from a quiz yeah this is another self-assessment quiz which I really liked this was a business assessment quiz you sign up you answer about 40 questions you get targeted advice based on the questions that you answered you should improve your business in a B C and D by the way if you want to get on a consulting call with us just fill out your phone number right there and we will call you and sell you on an eight thousand dollar product that has a 70% close rate this one is printing money for them right now all right this one is the HubSpot one how strong is your website it kind of goes through all the steps and all the things that people forget about their website like does it have SEO tags on it is it visible to Google do you have an h1 tag just various things that you should know about your website and puts it all just like the WP engine one puts it all together a nice report send you an email sequence all right so let's recap let's talk about what you should be doing next I like to end all my talks on very specific things of what you should do understand who your audience is sub niches are more powerful than broad strokes is easier to niche down into one specific target market and then come out later all right once you convince one sub niche to to buy something then you can move on to the second one build out much easier than starting broad and trying to capture an entire horizontal market all right hook for your product remember people that connect with people not companies what can you show them what pain can you solve for them that your product is going to solve how can you connect to people with people on an emotional level all right create a landing page that solves a problem or answers a question instantly so this is like a quiz or an assessment maybe it's just a checklist if you don't have time to put together a quiz have a checklist of the six things that you should totally be doing to improve your business now check one check two check three check for download this get started now anything that makes people succeed faster is good all right last part right eight emails that lead people through a nurture sequence to make sure that they are in the right frame of mind to purchase your product whether that SAS or an info product all right I want to say thank you very much and I'm happy to take questions for as long as we have great talk Keith thanks how have you seen open rates close it seems like a few years ago email was like a hack to have you have you seen the open rates I'm sorry let me start over how have you seen the the on page conversion rates from opt-ins change like over the past four years because it seems like early on people said they were higher like 15% or something like that but I've heard numbers in this conference like as low as 1% I product I think they're measuring different things when you were hearing the 15 percent I don't think you were hearing the standard like blog page to a newsletter opt-in for the over the last six years I've seen pretty much steady at one to two percent for that it has not gone up now what has I haven't seen any drop in any conversion rates to be honest it's all about the positioning I see top pages that are not blog pages like top pages that have a clear CTA converting at around 10 to 20 percent and like I said these quizzes and assessments they convert it around 60% it blows my mind every time webinars I'm seeing around 20 to 30 35 around there it really depends on the traffic you're getting we will see some traffic work really well with a with a certain landing and some traffic just completely fail but I'm I've been seeing pretty solid conversion numbers over time for email lists I haven't seen that decline any other questions out here here we go my question is for like marketplace applications would you consider it be proper for me to create two separate email lists for both segments of my marketplace as opposed to one would you say two separate sexes so for instance I have contractors on one side homeowners on the other side and I'm trying to get both of them to the marketplace yeah you should have two you should have two different lists at that point when you have very specific niches that you're going to be targeting you should definitely have two lists or at least segment them within a single app we have a client who does health coaching and then also teaches health coaches how to coach and even though they're on the same CRM system the emails that they send out are pretty much completely different the newsletter is the same but as far as marketing emails completely separate so you should have them on different funnels so it's all about segmentation it's all about understanding where people are coming in what they're interested in and how they can how you can create that connection with them and specifically in that case just like we were talking about the tax hints for for a freelance developers if you then have freelance designers you want to have that in a different track because if you start telling you a designer hey if you're a freelance developer you should totally do this they're going I'm not not a freelance developer who cares yeah one over here Keith sounds good so when you're looking at the distance or the time that you're doing intervals for your sequences what kind of things are you looking at to determine if it's once a week once a day for 28 across 28 days like how do you start working through that formula there's a couple of just off it's all off-the-cuff to be honest to start out you do it off-the-cuff because everyone's audience is different you can look at the the slides if you download them and it shows what we start at as far as timing generally it's one email every two days and then when sales emails we get a little bit more frequent maybe one once a day education the emails might be longer they might be once a week or something similar and then it's looking at how the open rates and the click rates are going right so we generally start with a best guess and then we monitor each week each month and see okay where's it falling down if there's a large gap between emails that are not being opened then we'll maybe make it a little bit shorter so we're staying top of mind that's an important question though because every single target audience or every single audience is different your audience is not going to be the same as the person next to you and the way that they interact with your emails and your site is going to be completely different so whenever you hear any marketer and myself include to talk about this kind of stuff these are strategies that we see working again and again but they are all jump off points for your specific audience no two clients are the same that we work with Keith I'll bring one question for you here someone looking at what you are presenting and saying that looks awesome but I'm just not there yet because I don't really have something to sell at the back end how would you recommend using strategies like this when you're just starting off whether just to build a list or in that early phase I would start off with a with the newsletter to be honest even though I said it's not the best example if you don't have anything yet what I would do is start off with a landing page and an opt-in for a checklist or something similar that you have to have an idea right so what is the number one thing you would tell someone at this conference that asked you about your idea right so let's go back to salary negotiation if someone come up to you and said hey what would you recommend for salary negotiation that's what you write down as a checklist or something easy something fast and then put that up on a landing page and then get people's emails to trade for that right one thing that I have heard this a number of times at this conference people have their email opt-in for the newsletter sign up for my newsletter almost always have bad conversion rate people don't realize when you're when you're the one trying to get emails you forget that an email address has value it is not a free thing just like you would convince someone to buy a product you need to convince someone that is worth it to give them your email address a great example I'm a couple of years ago is that Basecamp put together and now I'm totally blanking on the name the get started' book I believe they had it's an actually you saw it in the the previous presentation it's an actual saleable book I think was $27 and they released it as a free pdf on their site and hacker news flayed them alive they were like why would I give my email address for a PDF it's horrible right they're giving away a twenty seven dollar book for free but an email address is suddenly too expensive so it's all about positioning it's all about understanding that an email address has value to the people who are giving it to you so you have to give them something that is worthwhile in return thank you very much Keith all right thank you very much guys [Applause] you
