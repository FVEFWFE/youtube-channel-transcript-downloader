[Music] all right yeah Ryan babbles I am a Ione co-founder of harpoon app which is a freelancing application for right I'm tracking the invoicing application for freelancers I also do a little bit of content marketing and have some info products for SAS marketing as well so a tool that I found to be helpful and useful for me doing both of these is Twitter marketing automation and I was telling a friend of mine at lunch at breakfast this morning that I'm I'm a little nervous to talk about this subject because some people might think it's like the bane of the Internet and while some people are like sweet growth hacking like let's do it so then I was like well they uploaded it they want to hear about it so here it is and with with marketing automation through Twitter you know you can decide to go like on two different ends of the spectrum you know you can just automate a few things or you can have like a lot of automation and a fully automated account so it's really kind of up to you like how much you want to implement out of this talk but I'm just gonna run through a few of the things that I've done that I've brought success my way so with with Twitter there you know there are a lot of accounts out there and a lot of those are spammers which are fully automating a lot of things that they're doing 1.3 billion accounts on Twitter and 44 percent of those have never tweeted I was kind of shocked to hear that 43% of those tweeted over a year ago so there are a lot of accounts out there that are not being used or being used strangely enough but there then there's something that is a little bit more you know enlightening here that 29 percent of people check Twitter multiple times a day or 29% of those 1.3 billion accounts so even though there's a lot of people who aren't tweeting there are still a lot of people who are checking it or you know monitoring and even though they are not actively tweeting on it so that's three hundred seventy seven million people that are ripe for reaching out to via via Twitter it's a it's a pretty valid marketing channel so with my own personal site Ryan battles comm 33% of my traffic comes straight through Twitter links Google and email marketing bring up most of the rest with with the other being the small slice there but 33% I mean that's a lot of marketing there are a lot of traffic coming on my site through some of these things that I'm doing so my plan is a three step approach first I got to try to figure out how to get people to notice me on Twitter then entice them with a reason to follow me and then to convert and it's not just me this I run multiple accounts I even consult for clients one of my most challenging clients is a weight is in the waste industry they hired me they're like you know can you get us a Twitter account up and running for our our waste application and I'm like you know I don't know if anybody in the waste industry is tweeting or what we would even be tweeting but I'm proud to say we're up over 2,000 followers of people in the waste industry and every time we tweet out some news about waste industry it gets retweeted and favorited and it's it's a little insane so I'm like if I could do this with the waste industry there's really nothing that's off-limits here for going after this with Twitter marketing automation so first to get people to notice you you've got several different thing things that could happen within Twitter that would bring you a notification whether that's on your phone or your email or on your SmartWatch and that's whether you get a favorite a follow a retweet and mention someone adds you to the list or a direct message now one thing I will say I'm highly against direct message automation I think that it's just the worst I hate when I follow somebody and they're like hey thanks for following you know want you to download my ebook here I think that that's kind of scammy but a lot of this other stuff you know if you just favorite someone's tweet like what's wrong with that you know you get a lot of people to notice you that way and that's how I can grow into other niches where I haven't been before with different accounts so the two tools that I started off using first of all to automate some of my Twitter usage first was if this than that and what you can do there is you can automate the list building within Twitter so if you you say like alright anybody who tweets out I'll just keep using the example of waste management anybody who's tweeting out news about the waste industry I want you to add them to a list called waste industry simple enough that's an if-then if this then that recipe and in doing that I started notifying all these people like hey this company just added you to the list of waste management so that got them to our profile and then they would follow us and that was pretty sweet and then crowdfire has anyone used use that tool or heard of that tool used to be just don't follow its it's a way for you to follow other people based off of the people that they follow and it's like a rapid way to do it because you just like use your thumb and click click like so it's a it's a free app on your phone but I didn't I didn't quite like using that because it's not fully automated it required me to log in and do that every day so something that I came across my friend Justin McGill I recommended it was this this book called um become a technical marketer and that is a $2.99 ebook that if you're at all interested in learning how to hack your way through some marketing stuff highly recommended it gives you a lot of recipes for how to leverage different technologies out there and get some of the things done but so that taught me how to use Python to to use a Twitter library to actually automate a lot of these things that I was doing so through that I would create a script that would retweet favorite that would follow people based off of certain things and I was able to plug that into some of the accounts that I was managing which really grew the following but the problem is that required me to like log into my terminal every morning and type in a command to make it happen so I was like surely if this is just a script there's got to be a service out there that I could throw this on a server and have it run automatically so that's when I discovered Python anywhere and Python anywhere is a service with the free account you can upload a Python script and it'll execute for you on a daily basis so once I discovered that I was able to greatly grow the following in a lot of different ways and one thing I did notice is that if you some people when I was telling them about this presentation they're like you know well doesn't Twitter like shut you down for some of this stuff and yes in a way so the problem is don't be aggressive like with any of this automation stuff don't be like yeah let's follow 500 people a day and like see out where that gets us I just did it with like a small amount like a very I try to keep it under 100 touch points whether that's like a favorite or a retweet or a follower and unfollow I just try to keep it under a hundred and I fly you know under the radar one one when I first started I had it like it 200 different touch points per day and Twitter was revoking my my off and I had to go like restart it so so yeah it's just something that you know you kind of want to be smart with you don't want to be too overly aggressive with it but it is a way to you know keep some some basic touch points out there on Twitter to increase the following so the script that I have originally there was I would unfollow 50 people who hadn't followed me and then I would follow some followers of others that were in the same niche then I would follow people who were tweeting out certain keywords I would favorite anybody who had mentioned my username and when I say my I'm not just meaning my personal account but the other ones that I was managing so anybody who would favor or you know at mention us so typically it was like they were tweeting out an article or talking about us you know we just wanted to give him a little like hey thank you for talking to us on Twitter just with a little heart and then um so I would also favorite any tweet that came out from certain articles so this really helped out with that waste management company because there are 2 big publications online that blog simply about waste and all the different things that happen in the waste industry so I'm like if anybody is tweeting out stuff from this source then clearly they're interested in you know the waste industry and maybe we want to get them on our radar as well so that was a big one - just favorite those articles coming out and grew a lot of people that way so after you get people to notice you through some of those automations now it's like how do you get them to follow you well you have to have quality content on there and to automate the content it's not fully automated I mean you have to craft the tweets that you put in there but you can use tools like buffer to spread it out over time edgar which does essentially the same thing but will repeat your queue within different buckets q qu u u Co they actually if you select like certain interest categories they will help put different tweets in your buffer to go out so something I like to do there is for an account like maybe I want every day or every other day to at least have something go out via Twitter even if you know I didn't have the time to create my own tweet and then if this than that is also allows you to set up recipes where you can follow different RSS feeds and send things out so what I do with this if this than that is I created an RSS feed of inspirational quotes and then I told it to go pull from that feed and every once in a while send something out for a couple of the accounts that I manage so here's a tweet from the waste management I just want to show like you know when you when you put a graphic in with any of your tweets it's much more likely to get favored didn't liked here's just a simple example I just grabbed this one when I was creating the presentation but what is that yes six retweets and and seven favorites just from you know the random industry of a voice management so there is something you know to be sharing with the world even if they're not all like you know designers and developers which is you know initially what what I was targeting with my own stuff so then the final part of the recipe I mentioned was to convert so you get people to follow you you get people to notice you you're putting out content out there now how do you get them to subscribe to your email list or come to your site or something like that so you can create these Twitter cards and and then I pin them to the top of the Twitter profile but it's it's a simple one-click because Twitter already has their email all they have to do is click once and then they get added to your email list if they choose to subscribe so this is actually there are tutorials on how to do this both for convertkit and drip you just can google those and so if you use one of those two tools they'll show you how to type in you know your your email marketing list and create one of these and then I also put the URL to the site on the Left column there now a lot of people put their Twitter URL in the URL field but I also put it in the bio because a lot of people use Twitter on like like apps on their mobile device or something like that and some of those apps don't show the URL for the profile they just show the bio so if you put your URL in the bio you'll get a lot more click throughs as well so finally to close up what I would say if you only had 15 minutes per day or per week I would spend that time buffering up some relevant content maybe you're following some RSS feeds maybe you are you know following news or recent industry stuff so buffer of some relevant content at mentioned some other people who are you know follow other accounts and mention those people you can even add retweets to buffer so if some you know a bunch of people are tweeting some interesting stuff you don't want to just like plaster your list with them all these retweets you can buffer those up as well and always reply to ad mentions when people are trying to start conversations with you and then just to close if you want to read a case study of how I just two weeks ago spun up a Twitter account and tried to do some of this automation for this account freelance kik I did that and already we've got hundreds of followers I don't already sell I have some plans for how to take this to another level later on down the road but um you can read more about that here so to get these notes and links to everything I mentioned go to Ryan battles comm slash micro calm and [Applause] you
