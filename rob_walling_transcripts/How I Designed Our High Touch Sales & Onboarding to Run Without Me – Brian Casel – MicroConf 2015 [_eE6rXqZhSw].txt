[Music] okay so inbound sales on autopilot that's that's what I'm talking about here today for those of you I haven't met yet I'm Brian castle I co-host the boots draft web podcast with with Jordan ghoul will actually be speaking right after me last couple of years I've been running a site called restaurant engine which is a SAS kind of productized service web design service for restaurants and I currently teach a course called productize about building a product as service product as consulting model so last year on this at micro comp I didn't attendee talked about restaurant engine talking about content marketing and how we've built our inbound organic traffic steadily over time and that's really how we've grown the business is through you know consistent content email courses and that sort of thing and I talked about how I kind of removed myself from that process and outsourced and delegated it my talk here today is kind of the next step of that is how do we convert this inbound organic traffic into customers into sales for for restaurant engine but my goal since day one of starting restaurant engine was to build something that can ultimately run without me I I really wanted to see if I can build something that can basically run on autopilot and become an asset that that either runs in the background or you know can become a saleable asset that I can leverage and as as the years went on in building restaurant engine I I learned that it's the done-for-you service and and the high-touch activities whether it's the content marketing our consultations and sales which I'll talk about in a second and our customer support and done-for-you onboarding and and even as I learned that and that's what provided the value in this business I still worked to remove myself and systematize it and automate it as as much as I possibly can so here is a look at an iPhone and this is the notification that I receive when a new customer comes to restaurant engine signs up and pays our setup fee and right here this is the only touch that I see when a customer comes through our system through our marketing through our sales signs up now they're being handed off to the customer support team they're on Bart onboarding the customer when I get this ping on my phone I don't even need to get it I could turn it off if I wanted to but I like it it has a little sound on it this is like 2g you know so that's one notification I don't really want to turn off but when that happens that it represents that the the system has worked that that somebody came to our site a couple of weeks ago requested the consultation somebody from our team called them up followed up they that lead was nurtured they signed up and now they're being handed off automatically to the team to set up their new website but it wasn't always like this for the first few years of this business it was generally all me I was I was doing all the customer support basically that happened in my gmail inbox I was the one doing all these consultation calls I'd spent four or five hours every single day calling up customers I was on the live chat you know answering questions just kind of hustling and clawing my way into the the first few customers in this in this business but about 15 months ago my daughter came along and I had to slip this slide in the presentation today but that's when it really it became real for me that I have to remove myself from this business because my time is very much limited and you know that that was coming around you know about two years ago so that's when I really got serious about building these systems and automating so I'm going to talk about the four main components of our inbound sales system and that's basically the initial consultation our CRM how we organize leads our follow-up and how we nurture leads and get them to ultimately sign up and then the onboarding to bring them on board and manually set up their site and let's get into it so here is a video demo that we do it's it's 25 minutes long it's recorded it's on the site and my goal here was just to try to educate customers as much as I can before we get on a phone call with them and try to answer some of the most common questions that that we've received so I did about a year or two of consultation calls before I came out with this video demo so I did all those common questions and and tried to cover it in this in this 25-minute it's an extended you know pretty long video for someone to sit through but we get plenty of leads who come in and want to learn as much as they can they already see the pricing and everything so there we try to qualify them as much as as much as possible by the time they get into a consultation they can request the consultation right alongside that that video but not not everyone who comes to our website our video people you know they don't rest on toners don't want to sit through a long video so we also have a dedicated forum on our website to request a consultation and actually as you'll see it's it's quite a few questions so we're asking for a lot of information here we're asking for their phone number we're asking for their email address asking them about their restaurant are they a food truck are they interested in online ordering and we're getting all this information and so that to kind of you know a little bit kind of qualifies them and you know they're they're not just kicking the tires they're actually going to fill out this form from there the form actually brings that person into our CRM automatically and we actually use Trello for this I just found that it's the most flexible solution for us and it's easy for us to integrate all of these different pieces we connect it with zapier so when the person fills out the the consultation form it creates a lead a card in Trello and all of this leads information is in is automatically inputted into the description of the card I used some some markdown to kind of format it and and here we have you know their name the restaurant name email phone number you know what did they say that there they were interested like which features and whatnot so I have a sales person on my team who goes in every day and sees these these new leads and you know so she'll call up every new lead as typically same day sometimes you know the next day and she will write comments on the card after every interactions that we can understand you know what's what's going on if if I have to jump in if we have someone else working on sales you know jumping in it we're all on the same page we also use the due date and Trello to to mark the next follow-up action so every card we have procedures in place that every after every interaction set the due date either for for tomorrow if you didn't connect today then call back tomorrow if you did then call back in a week so there's always a next action and that dude it is the is is the the notification for that we also do email follow-up after every after every call so we actually use help scout for this not only just for customer support but also for pre-sales because it makes it easy to kind of collaborate within the team and ask each other questions and make notes internally we're also running some marketing automation email marketing from the time that they request the consultation not only are we calling them up manually sending personal email follow-ups but they're also receiving automated emails we're using drip for this so they're getting a case you know customer case studies highlights of our features and these are actually tailored based on what they entered in the consultation form so if they said something like their if they're a food truck owner they'll get a case study about food truck customers from there eventually they would either sign up or or they disappear hopefully they sign up and that would happen either over the phone with our sales person she'll literally just fill out the signup form for them over the phone that happens quite often or they'll click a link from one of the emails one of the personal follow-ups or one of our email marketing and get back to the signup form they'll sign up and I get that little ping on my phone awesome and then we actually use a beer again to to connect them to our customer support team so here we're looking at our slack chat room internally so the support team gets up gets a ping hey we have a new sign up go ahead and initiate them they'll send them an email and get them started on setting up their website you know requesting their their materials and whatnot that used to be me I used to I used to take you know a new customer's account information and like manually forward it over to the support team but now it all just kind of happens on on autopilot so you know again this is kind of an overview of those four main components and some of the technologies that we're using we we kind of connected up using gravity forms for the consultation form Google Docs is where we organize all of our procedures so so all of our sales calls and follow-ups all of these have documented procedures and documented key you know answers to common questions and answers to common objections and all that we use Skype for the phone number so the team is all remote so we use a you know a Skype phone number that we can all kind of share is like one company number Trello zapier kind of you know connects all these different pieces together help scout for email drip for email marketing and and slack to kind of communicate internally and again with some automated messages and slack so that my team is up to date on what's going on and all that kind of adds up to a productized service so again I'm taking high touch activities content marketing sales in you know phone sales manual email follow-up manually initiating new customers and walking them onboard into the into the service and then connecting it all up with highly standardized procedures some software some third-party tools and just kind of hooking all these things up so that everything just works as a streamlined cohesive system it took several years to to get this working the way that it does but it's it's been it's been you know a lot of fun to kind of kind of kind of build it and that's this is the kind of stuff that I actually teach in my course on productize services and I put together a setup guide to show you exactly how we hooked up all these different pieces that I talked about today so the settings and configurations from connecting gravity forms and your WordPress site use the the drape the the zapier connection to Trello as a CRM help Scout all of that is documented in a guide that I put together and you can get that at Cass gem calm slash micro comm and if you have any other questions or anything I'll be around tonight so happy to talk to you thanks [Applause]
