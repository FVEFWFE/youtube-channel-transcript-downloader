================================================================================

in this video I'm going to talk through eight amazing developer tools you're probably not yet using I'm Rob Walling I've started and grown six companies written three books about entrepreneurship and invested in more than 100 startups I want to start by giving a shout out to the Tiny Seed Founders who I reached out to Via our slack Channel and as for suggestions for Dev tools that they've recently discovered or that they think are lesser known than they should be Tiny Seed is the first startup accelerator for SAS bootstrappers if you're interested you can check it out at tinyc.com but I did want to thank the founders who took the time to help me build the list for this video tool number one is toast log you can find that at toastlog.com where you can get console errors right on your web page and I love their homepage animation showing how it works so with toast log you can see errors warnings and logs as they happen on your site without having to open the browsers console and you can find bugs you didn't know were there via notifications in their unique toast format in my opinion it's a steal for a Perpetual license do number two is shotter shotter.cc it's a free Mac only screenshot tools for designers front-end Engineers mobile developers and those who care about pixels I like that I like that opinionated take shotter is a small and fast screenshot app built for those who care about visual design they can do scrolling screenshots easily pixelate parts of your screenshots it can OCR the text optical character recognition to tell you what the actual text is saying on the screen and a bunch more I think it's a pretty cool tool and it's free tool number three is CSS scan Pro you can get that at csscanpro.com it's a reimagined Dev tool for web designers the tool makes it a lot easier to figure out the looks of your favorite website so you can hover over an element and get everything that you need the Styles the animations assets instantly so you can copy elements with a single click or edit them with an intuitive CSS Editor without writing any code it's 20 a month or 120 a year and this is I think a good way when you're inspired by something don't shamelessly copy it but you know you can get inspired and learn some CSS and tweak it and and add your own branding elements in a way that can level up your website tool number four is PS PDF kit the API and the quote from the Tiny Seed founder was I would shamelessly plug pspdf kit API if you're dealing with PDFs in any way programmatically this is obviously an API that allows you to manipulate PDFs and it has a massive feature set so it simplifies how you process documents with a powerful secure API you can fast and easily integrate it and it enables you to generate to convert to modify PDFs it interacts with word docs and images and kind of everything you can imagine so this looks like a pretty full feature tool the pricing I'm not even going to go into it because there's just different levels depending on what you do they have a SDK they have an API they have a lot if you're dealing with PDFs programmatically getting a tool whether you get PS PDF kit or whether you know you get another tool cannot recommend enough having a solid API that is doing all that manipulation for you tool number five is PG G mustard you can find them at PG mustard.com this tool lets you sift through and see query plans without having to Wade through explain analyze in your postgres database it can help you find which queries are a problem and give you ideas for helping work out what can be done to fix them a single license for one user for a year is 100 bucks and teams are 500 for a year tool number six is raycast raycast.com it's a fast completely extendable launcher so it lets you complete tasks calculate using a built-in calculator share common links script commands use shortcuts do file search system commands quick links floating notes launch apps it has Snippets and more they have a really generous free plan and then it's ten dollars per user per month for if you want a paid team plan but it looks like individually you can use it for free and get I don't know all the value I can imagine that you would need out of this moving your hand to your mouse to do things is pretty time consuming it's way faster to have a command and that you can access everything from your keyboard and that's what launchers allow you to do tool number seven is linear it's at linear dot app and they describe themselves as the issue tracking tool you'll enjoy using they say linear helps streamline software projects Sprints tasks and Bug tracking built for high performance teams there's a free plan and then there are tiers eight dollars per user per month and 12 dollars per user per month and judging by the website is really well designed and so if you are in the market for a project task Sprint development bug tracker this is definitely one that would be on my list tool number eight is ngrok and the founder who recommended this to me said I've been using ngrok a ton recently for working with API callbacks and web hooks in my local environment I'm using their paid products since it's so useful they have several products but we use the tunnels feature and I'm going to admit engrock there's a lot that they offer to focus in on just one piece of it they serve web apps with one command so you can get your local host onto the internet with the minimum amount of headache no firewall issues no vpns you can introspect and replay requests for a tight feedback loop connect to any system regardless of network or location firewalls VPN none of that matters and so that's the idea you know when you're building apis and web Hooks and you're on localhost that's not on the internet right so it's this big pain to try to mock things up but that's where ngrok tunnels specifically comes in and allows you to you know get it on the internet in a safe and secure Manner and then there are several other products from ngrok so this is a super interesting tool one I had not heard of and I really appreciate the suggestion Since I no longer write code day to day I had to rely on my community at tinyseed to help me build the list for this video and to allow me to help you you know to give you this list of eight things that might not be on your radar and if you're not connected to a community of like-minded startup Founders you should check out microconf connect it's microconfconnect.com it's the community that we run we have almost 4 000 Founders and aspiring bootstrapped and mostly bootstraps startup Founders it's heavily moderated and it's free and it's a bustling community of folks helping each other out and in fact if I hadn't posted this to the Tiny Seed slack I would have posted it in microconf Connect I would expect that in future videos you will also hear me bring up Microsoft Connect as another source of of a Brain Trust of ideas for when I'm stuck thinking about things I turn to my communities to help push me forward so I hope at least one or two of those tools resonated with you if you enjoyed this video please hit like subscribe to the channel we have videos like this coming out every week covering topics helping you build launch and grow your SAS company so that's it for today's video and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
