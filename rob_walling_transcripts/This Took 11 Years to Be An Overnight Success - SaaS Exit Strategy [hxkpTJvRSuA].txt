================================================================================

[Music] yeah thanks for having me my Myka Rob thanks for inviting me to speak Xander thanks for coordinating so this is um this is by far the most personal talk I've ever given and it feels fitting to me that you know I'm doing it here at micro conf among hundreds of people who I respect many of whom I've come to know and many of whom I admire so thanks for kind of coming along on this journey both with Mike and I through the years of micro cough and you know with me through the podcast and from beach towels to a life-changing exit we haven't add as much of it this year but it's been a little bit of a micro tradition to talk about why we do the things we do and a couple years ago Patrick McKenzie said you know all the rest of this I'm gonna give you some tactics or something to think about but all the rest of this all of this is dust compared to this so this is my wife who you'll be hearing from tomorrow from this stage as well as our two boys going to see them Nutcracker in San Francisco all right so this talk it's broken up into five parts and it's gonna be about 40 minutes maybe 45 if I tell some extra stories and the whole point of this there's two things so a couple things I want you to take away from one you know it's a long journey I think most of us know that already another one is probably the most popular question or the most common question I get about selling drip was what made you decide to do it what was your thought process what did you go through and that I want to talk I'm gonna dive really deep into that here in a way that I haven't I've already talked about on the podcast in other places but if you've heard that you're still gonna hear more about it and then the third thing I'm gonna talk about is go really in depth as much as I can you know given that there's an NDA I'm gonna go in depth to what it looked like from the inside and what it really felt like including like graphs and charts showing how often we spoke over these months it's just a pretty fascinating process and I should make a note here that this was my thought process Derek and I along with our spouses frankly we kind of made this we made this decision together and so this is just from my perspective of my motivations you know and and realizing at a certain point that I had started building products for certain reason and I had gone off the rails at one point and and thinking about how can I get back how can I get off this crazy train right off the cuff I didn't know all right so we're gonna start with part one we'll walk through some different years different phases and then I'm gonna dig really really deep into it in terms of the acquisition and what that actually looked like so part one this is 2005 to 2009 I was transitioning from there was some salaried work in here but there's a lot of consulting ok and consulting for me was very life-sucking I just despised it didn't like working for other people didn't like the lack of freedom made really good money for how old I was a hundred and fifty K 180 K some years but I really wanted to get into products I felt like that was the golden ticket and so during these years I either acquired or launched products like dotnet invoice wedding toolbox there's a random assortment apprentice linemen jobs which is a job board for electricians and then just beach towels which is the beach towel reference in the in the the title and just beach towels was an e-commerce website and it did a couple grand it did zero when I acquired it and then I learned how to market reasonably well and it did a couple grand by the time I sold it later on realizing I don't want to be in physical products right this was a big realization but then I took that knowledge parlayed it up into my other products DIY duck boat is an interesting one it was a duck boat plans you could build you go to hawk eye so there was a whole instruction list and a shopping list so you could go to Home Depot why is that so funny my wife gives me so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about this one and I'm like I this thing so I bought it from a guy who build duck boats he had testimo nose he had the whole thing and he's just like I don't know how to sell this and it was doing 50 bucks a month and I bought it from him for a couple hundred and then I did SEO on it this is 2007 maybe and it was doing five hundred bucks a month later and I and I was like this is a car payment dude don't don't mock me for the DIY the duck but you love duck boats you love to mock me about duck boats and then CMS themer which was up really a product I serviced before we we called things those so this collaboration this collection the the portfolio is if you will of products was on the low end you know DIY duck boat did 500 bucks a month and on the high end best month dotnet enlisted five grand and so combined that all together I was running all these it was just me I was a coder I was doing SEO doing some AdWords and I had a couple VA s that were were helping me out and this I made less doing this than I did consulting but I was way happier so give or take on any given year maybe 110 to 130 in terms of that but I I had so much freedom right and the whole point of me getting into products why I did that why would I take a pay cut to go do something else I was asked that by my friends whose souls were sold slowly being sucked out of them by their job and I said over time I realized that there were three reasons that I had to do products that I needed to own kind of own my destiny I guess as a way I said it the first is freedom second is purpose and the third is relationships I'm going to dive a little bit deeper into each of these now I didn't come up with this I actually heard it on a podcast years ago and then I brought it up to Sherry one time and she said I miss my wife and she said you know this is a whole there's psychology there's research around this like this this isn't some unique thing I've come up with but I've come to own this like when I don't have all three of these things I'm not happy and I would actually and I slowly kind of go off the rails and I would actually say that most people in this room if you since you are entrepreneurial if you're here you probably need these three things as well and any one of them if you remove it you're gonna you're gonna be unhappy eventually that's my that's my hypothesis today so freedom what does that mean I think for most people in this room it means the I'm sorry I was one fine it means the ability to choose what you work on right you want to work on interesting things you don't want clients dictating something you don't want to boss dictating and the other thing is to be in control of your time your income and your mobility Tim Conley not to you but it's to be an in control of of can I take a week off can I take a month off can I work three hours a day can I work when I want to to increase decrease your income and to be able to perhaps travel the world if you want or not these three things are very hard with traditional jobs are actually with traditional consulting even when I was a consultant I didn't have these so this was the freedom that I sought and I think it's the freedom that a lot of us in this room seek as founders or folks who are aspiring to do this and then the last one is that I learned later I didn't realize this up front but not having your life consumed by your business because if you think about your business all the time even if you're traveling the world and doing things that are fun you don't have the freedom that that you you won't have the freedom that you want the next part was purposed remember freedom purpose and relationships so purpose I think is personal I think each of us needs to find our own purpose and find what ignites you for me I have learned over time that it is two things and I could probably do a whole talk just on these two things but for me it's learning new things I've found that you know I took the strengths finder test and I'm a learner or there's some yeah I think it's a learner and when I stop learning I like dribble metaphorically and then when I stop teaching and teaching is this is why I do a pod 2 podcast every week this is why I I've written a couple books this is why I have the blog this is why we do micro coffe is why I do talks I've made exponentially more money from software products but over the years right then then the actual teaching and selling of stuff and and Margaret Kong tickets or whatever but it's if I don't have those things then I'm not happy just doing software doesn't allow me to learn and teach enough so I found this for you you're gonna have to figure out what your own personal purposes so that talks this talks probably not gonna do that for you the third thing is relationships and this is the one that I think most of us as may be technically oriented people forget or I think it's forget and I forget this for six months at a time and suddenly realize oh yeah I really have kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this up like you know my wife is pissed off at me or I haven't been with my kids as much as I should have been this is the one or your friends this is the one that I think that we overlook for work and for the even as bootstrappers when we have more control of our time I think we tend to focus it on on the driving revenue for it or whatever and relationships tends to be naturally the last thing on a lot of our minds I think relationships is as important I think this nice to everyone I don't think you find your own kind of relationship equilibrium I think relationships having having this kind of value or this the freedom of relationships means two things one is being able to choose whom you interact with I worked at a bunch of jobs where I was either managing people who I didn't pick I was managed by people who I didn't like or I had co-workers who weren't as motivated weren't as good weren't as whatever I'm sure everyone in this room has experienced this and so the ability to perhaps as a founder build a team that you like and you're like Amanda I there's like ten people on my team and ivory I would hang out with all of them I really enjoyed working with them like the ability to have that control is I think amazing and I think that's one of the reasons I became a founder and I would guess a lot of folks in this room as well the other one are the part of relationships is having time and headspace so it's not just time but it's the headspace that your business is not sucking the life out of you or when you're with your kids you're thinking oh man is the is the database gonna grind up tonight or oh boy we got a text that the queue is down or that whatever you know are the marketing things someone's beating us to the punch right so it's time and headspace to be with the people that matter to you so this is why I got into products and I would actually guess that it's why almost every even if you've never realized this I think it's why most of us get into products so products allowed me to quit consulting and this was awesome right and it was like a dream come true and again I was making less money but it was the days were just magical honestly for like the first couple years I just pinched myself all the time thinking so I don't have a boss anymore and I can just kind of you know hang around and do stuff and so I achieved freedom in in 2008 2008-2009 right as I had stopped consulting I achieved this achieved freedom achieved the purpose which was driving my business forward and hanging out with my family and I had amazing relationships and I really enjoyed it so this was a win but I soon you're there's a lot of butts in this talk I go down a road and then I realize no not like that not butts like that I heard you chuckle so I go down a lot of roads and then I realized this isn't actually it either isn't what I wanted or there's kind of a something that comes out of left field and knocks me on my butt I'm sorry that's as good as it gets with me so this is why I have intermissions remember with the videos and stuff okay so what happened is this would happen to a number of my products but don''t invoice revenue in 2008 actual revenue numbers don't yeah you can read that all right so we start in May of 2008 and it goes to March of the following year it's a one-time sale product right it's not a SAS app so we see 1,500 1,500 1,500 swings way up to 5 grand because I did some big deal with a web host and then you can see October it drops down and it bottoms out around 500 and then it swings back up and this was around the financial crisis but this this was a little extreme but it was also not totally uncommon and so I had 5 6 products with any given time and they were doing this and for me I suddenly had freedom of purpose and relationships but I was stressed the hell out all the time because I'm thinking am I gonna can I am I gonna do this for 5 years or am I gonna go back to consulting which I couldn't imagine favors and death or am I gonna go back to salaried employment which is even a fate worse than a fate worse than death and and I just couldn't imagine like I need something that's gonna last here I'm a very long-term thinker and so I added one more item to my list so we have this freedom you've heard about we have this purpose of learning and teaching we have the relationships obviously and I added this one stability okay it's the stability or the longevity maybe a better way to put it is like something that's gonna last and I don't have to worry about every day I don't have to think about every week of am I gonna have to you know sell the kids to pay that the mortgage or something and so I started with how like how do I achieve this that's the big question so I think of products that I've just shown you know all these in one time sale products and such as being kind of stability 1.0 and realizing that was not that was not gonna cut it so I was thinking like how do i how do I get stability this is keep in mind this is 2009 and in fact in 2010 like the kind of the cool part of the story is we had our second son and I took about eight or nine months where I worked 8 to 12 hours a week just because I had these products that were really mostly an autopilot and they got at you know organic traffic and such and now that is time I will I will never I will sorry I will never in my life regret the you know the months that I spent with him huh you practice a talk and you don't do this then you get in front of people I will never in my life regret the time that I you know spent with him later on there is time that I will regret and I loop that back but not spending with him not yeah alright so this was like this was the this was my dream come true from the time you know I was whatever twenty something years old was to be able to have products and be in control of this and have the freedom but realizing that it could be taken away at any time was was frightening to me as someone who wants this stability right or once a long term longevity and so I realized that what I really needed was instead of these stupid one-time sales and again this is 2009-2010 I wanted recurring revenue okay so we all know this now but give me a break of seven years ago we didn't even SAS didn't even exist it did but we didn't call it that yet so recurring revenue was absolutely I thought the golden ticket it was the Holy Grail and indeed it was the best thing since sliced bread and it turns out it was in 2011 when I went back to work because I did eventually get bored of I love being with the kid but eventually you got to do your next thing right you got to learn and teach so in 2011 I went after stability 2.0 and this is where I said I need to I need to build there I need to buy a SAS app and you know I basically took the revenue so the way I acquire you know acquired and built all those other apps that I showed you earlier down an invoice is I had enough money in a bank account from consulting I had $15,000 I'd saved up over a year and I bought don''t invoice for 11 grand and then I took that revenue I grew the business and then I had another 10 grand and I bought the next one and then I had five grand I bought this so that was it it was it was no there was no trust fund it came from a working-class family my dad was an electrician this was just me working and saving money and doing it same thing with hit tail so that was the SAS epic wired in 2011 and I have an in-depth talk in fact it's one of my fits one of my favorite talks of it I've ever given it was three four years ago Micro cough and it's called how to 10x and 15 months and it's about yeah it's like 51 minutes of just talking about taking it from whatever 1500 a month in revenue and and growing it up and I go month by month it's it's just I've watched it and you know recently in spoke man that's you nailed it on that one and I don't I tend to be my worst critic so I don't pat myself on the back very much so the story was I by the SAS app that's doing 20 grand annual revenue right so right around 1,500 paid the 30 grand for it and again I didn't have a trust fund for the 30 grand the 30 grand was revenue from down an invoice and beach towels and I'm just building and building and building and of course the night I wired the 30 grand I told sherry I what the what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if I'd done like I've never had that much money in my life and I just sent it to someone and I bought this piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] app and and she said but this is what you do this is what you do this is who you are if you weren't doing this what would you be doing and I didn't have an answer so I worked over the next 18 months with a couple contractors mostly on my own and got it up to a 300k run rate which was a life-changing moment for me because you think I'm kind of cruising living in you know Central Valley California with my family which is great and again you know from those products I was making a hundred ten out of 20 K which is great you know great living we could afford a house and such and then this this was a game changer because this you know you know SAS especially when you don't have a lot of I didn't need a lot of developers because I was kind of coding myself 80% margins right maybe more net margins so I was just making more money than I had ever seen and we we we banked a lot of it and we used it to you know travel a little more but it was it wasn't amazing it was again that next step of the dream you know is going from kind of making a living to then wow holy crap I've made it like I remember us I was like I think I've made it this is it I'm done I'm gonna retire man it's a 65 I'm doing this forever but there were some things that kept happening so about every six months Google would do that and not intentionally but Google has a way just like a lot of big companies do of accidentally just breaking all your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if you rely on them so they had they had not provided remember when they used to give keywords that's what head tail used and so then they went not provided and hit tail was like decimated so I was freaking out thinking I've sold most of those other apps my whole income my whole you know kind of livelihood is based on this this app and if it goes under like what am I again I might not go back to consulting like salary like this is too I'm too far along in this to take that step back you know and and I probably wouldn't had to consult for long but it was scary to me I I didn't have the stability that I wanted and and Google did this about every six months they then broke I was scraping something and then they broke that and then Google Webmaster Tools then they broke that and they just kept doing it and always happened when I was like I was at Microsoft about to go on stage and then I did this is six hundred errors because you can't import anything it's like oh my gosh and I'm the only guy to developed on it so we are we were in Europe and then it happened and it was always like I don't want to do this until I'm am I gonna do this one I'm fifty or sixty five like is this app actually gonna be a decade or two decades long app can I bet my future on it because if not I need to find yeah okay so I didn't have stability that's all point but if not I need to find stability 3.0 right that's I realized there was something else that I needed to do to feel for me like I had something that was gonna last a decade or maybe even longer assuming I lived that long but oh my have life insurance don't worry so hum all right stability 3.0 I realized was not being reliant on a single external data source right so not being like a Twitter client or needing all of Google stuff in order to function and so this was a big one for me there were two other things that I didn't love about his tail one was the price point was pretty low and so churn was pretty high and it wasn't a core business application so it was just something that was gonna it's doing well I sold it about I don't know 15 16 months ago and the new owners loved it but it I just I didn't think it was you know in my my long-term interest to keep doing it so part two is the next step after hit tail okay and that was a course trip Derek we heard from earlier he said he work around on code in late 2012 and we launched in 2013 I've talked extensively about the drip and the process of growing at finding product market fit and stuff I'm not gonna rehash that here suffice to say for those who haven't heard it or even just to refresh your memory 2013 was really the year we launched it 2014 was the year we found product market fit all of this is actual revenue I this is online I published this in previous talks but that was the launch right so you see the $7,500 was in November December of 2013 yeah 2013 and then we kinda it took us about seven months to really find product market fit you can see it dip down and we just built mailed part of MailChimp and nobody wanted it and then we eventually by the time we added automation in July of 2014 that's where the 10-8 happens and we had completely stopped marketing between then and then and yet you know all the numbers were in the right direction so that was an amazingly fun adventure and by fun I mean it totally sucked because I'll get to that later but and this is the starting to scale which is the same it's just an extension of the graph right so you see the 7501 there and then eventually in I can't even I can't read it it's in mid 2015 yeah we got up to 45 K so this was the last time I really talked about hit tail revenue and you know there's a reason for that because we started getting acquisition inbound acquisition interest and it just didn't make sense to keep doing it we also had a bunch of competitors some of who were stealing our ideas and claiming they were their own so that didn't quite that didn't quite fly so I started being a little you know a little more tight-lipped about it all that to say this looks amazing right this is the this is the next dream this is the dream of every SAS founder is to have this amazing growth curve and yet this was what drip net profit looked like and from June 13 I'm sorry June 2013 to March 2015 I'm not gonna put a scale on the left suffice to say that red line is zero so it's all negative and that is each month so that's not a cumulative each month was negative and it was negative by thousand or tens of thousands that's all I'll say I was not dropping six figures a month all of this was subsumed the reason I had this money was I was just taking all the profit out of hit tail so they can hit tail profit as it starts hip tail starts to go down because I'm not working on it anymore Derek and I are working on drip and I'm just bailing bailing money out of one into another you know so you can see where this is going so we finally you know we break even just on one month we break even so it doesn't pay it back but at least we broke even by it looks like yeah March of 2015 now what this meant was in 2014 I had the hardest year of my entrepreneurial career by far and it was especially the latter half I had at the time again the most money I had ever seen in my life in an in a bank account and it was all basically hit tail revenue and some a drip and it was one hundred and fifty thousand dollars and I could not believe there was that much money in an account I did not grow up with that much money and I was dumping and I'm not dumping but I was pushing all in to drip I had we hired a head of revenue to try to move faster because it's such a just such a competitive space right to be in marketing automation and within 60 days I had a 60 or 70 thousand dollar tax bill some expenses came due that I didn't expect I figure what the other thing was but I spiced to say I wrote a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in checks out of that account poof so now I have thirty thousand dollars in a bank account that I used to have a hundred fifty and I essentially had enough money to make payroll for 45 days and it was myself it was Derek and it was two engineers that we had just hired we were with three months past hiring them and I realized I made it it was my fault like I made a shitty cash management decision I messed it up there's no doubt but it took six or seven months to recover because I had no weather outs right I don't have a parent who could borrow money from I actually could really consider borrowing from a 401k which is very much against Who I am I was trying to figure out if I could borrow against credit cards I'm it was just stupid you just get to a point where you're like I don't know what I'm gonna do am I gonna lay somebody off that I just like my whole community knows we have this little tight tech community and it's like I don't know man so you know hopefully my mistake can be just a warning to everyone else but this was the year that I regretted I talked to you about that I will never regret the time that I spent with with my son this is the the six months that that I deeply regret because I realized I I really didn't have freedom anymore I had a purpose that was cool but I was certainly [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out my relationships and around this time this is when I told my wife I said you know this this is it I can't I can't do this again like I'm not gonna start another one from scratch I'm assuming we're gonna make it out of it I'm gonna figure it out but but I'm done after this like whatever I don't know what after this means maybe maybe I run it till I'm dead and then I really am done or maybe maybe I you know whatever maybe Derek essentially eventually buys me out or maybe we just have so much cash we hire a CEO or maybe we get acquired and maybe whatever it is I'm not doing another one of these and my wife she's so she's very tactful right she's a psychologist wit has a way with words and kind of can ease you into things and help you try to see what the deeper meaning and what you're saying she said yeah that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because this is what you do I don't think it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's unsettled she still said thinks it is I don't think I'm gonna do another one okay so been a little heavy and I don't like talking straight for 40 minutes so I have a couple this is a really quick intermission based on normally what I have so first lesson is don't leave your phone unlocked with your kids in the house okay so I got I picked up my phone and I there it is so yeah and then there were videos and there were so there were like four hundred of these on my phone and I'm sitting there like delete delete and then finally someone showed me that you can bulk delete so thank you thank you Anna so and then here's the other do we have volume on video all right so this is a short one but little joke and I think that I think maybe this kid takes after me listen this joke here you're in a concrete room when the saw in a table what do you do I don't know what do I do the answer is you saw the table in half too make a hole climb out though that's it sorry I poor kid he has me as it as a humor role model can you imagine yeah so anyways it gets better um hopefully he'll learn from his mom and long-term okay so we come we did make it past 2014 I did not you know I did not completely spontaneously combust even though I felt like I was going to so we make it to 2015 and now the profit started coming right and so I'm like alright we crossed over that barrier sass we're growing fast we're going faster than you know the curve I showed you like we started accelerating past there we introduced workflows it's alright yeah we did I think that's no I was in till 2016 sorry but automation really picked up and we were really starting to take a lot of our competitors customers and so drip net profit and again there's no scale on this but its thousands to tens of thousands like I said this is what it looked like from March 2015 to for about the next year in April 2016 which is just a few months before the acquisition closed so anybody who's run a SAS app in a highly competitive space where you're fast growing and you basically need to hire bodies as soon as you have the revenue in order not to get killed by the competition or you could slow growth but anyone who's been in that that situation knows that as soon as you have 5 or 10k you hire another body as soon as you have 5 or 10k you hire that next body just to keep up especially if you're scaling an app that requires a lot of a lot of queueing a lot of technology intensive stuff where the database is falling over every four months and you have to redeploy it and the Amazon instances go from fifteen hundred to three grand to six grand a month just to keep the service going and that that's what this curve means that's why even after hitting profitability you know you can see November and February we're basically breaking even when the line hits the zero at the bottom so the line yeah x-axis I'm sorry is a zero I'm not just I'm not here to say sass apps don't make the money because says apps mint money right I mean it's if you hit a place where you don't have a ton of competition like we do you hit a place where you have a hit tail you hit a place where you know maybe your growth is a little slower or even you just have a different scenario than this you don't have 500 people 500 other companies coming after you in our situation it was this is what it looked like this is as well as I know how to manage a company and build a product and your market and this this this was it so again I could have slowed we could have slowed growth and just said we're just going to grow slower and not hired these people but it was it was not something that we were looking to do we were looking to you know to keep keep taking market share and the thing I learned from this of course is something we all probably know but maybe don't we know it intrinsically but maybe haven't said it out loud is that fast growing companies are very very rarely profitable and so while fast growing sounds great it is something where you have to ask yourself how long am I willing took a forgo profit for growth it's just a gut check your answer may be you know if I was if I was 25 years old and I had fire in my belly maybe I'd be willing to do it for 10 or 20 years I'm gonna be 43 this year and I've done a lot of these and at a certain point you know you look around and you think to yourself I'm all in on this I am all in I am 43 years in I'm 15 years of an entrepreneurial career or I guess maybe that's only 11 or 12 but everything I have is here if this company goes under if something happens and it explodes if we can't keep up if a competitor kills us I am going back to consulting I have an item I don't know if I would have done that but can you imagine me like coding hey could I get a job I'd becoming a micro Gump being like anybody hire me for dad I see sharp guys I'm really good I just it was scary and and I I thought about this a lot and I reflected and again you know remember Derek and I were making all these decisions and stuff so this is not necessarily his experience but this is mine I'll go back to this quote from Rand Fishkin who is the CEO of SEO Maas which is a often admired SAS company and they you know have been they were fast growing they raised a round of funding around this time and there was a whole thread on line this is five years ago maybe was well before drip and he says at the time we raised buckets of money I think they raised ten or twenty million I don't member he says we I had personally as a CEO 25k in a checking account I had no car and I had a rented apartment and awhile in walking distance to my office and at this point they were doing a million a month more than a million a month and there's a whole conversation about he was like this how do isn't it supposed to be different like when I wants the social network this is not what happens what's amazing it so I did this I did a part it like some of this talk in Europe since then since the our acquisition this happened in November this is like four months ago you can't read it all I'm gonna hop down and read it so this guy named will Reynolds I don't know who he is he tweets he says beware of the illusion of success most people you look up to are more invested in looking successful than being successful and Rand Fishkin tweets back to him but I love I love Rand for this he is so honest every time I hear me he's transparent not for the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] transparency I want to market my company he's transparent because that's who he is he replies and he says I just want one win just one and will replies does a win for you require an exit or going public and ran says an exit of any kind sale IPO private equity buyout etc I want to go from aspiring entrepreneur to successful entrepreneur no I don't agree with rands definition that you have to have an exit or an IPO to be a successful entrepreneur but what I do see in Rand is that it sounds like he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] burned out it sounds like he is just taking punches in the gut he's been running this business for over 10 years as far as I know and to him I don't know if he still has 25k in his bank account but I would sure feel like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if that were my situation and I had watched this evolve over time and I so in mid-2015 my personal state of affairs is we've reached profitability for some months do I have freedom and the answer was no but we were hustling we were busting our asses on this business I was thinking of it along with Derrick day and night do I have purpose I did because the purpose was to grow the business and I were actually really loved that and talking to people at Microsoft getting you know new customers all that stuff did I have really healthy relationships no because I was thinking about my business all the time and did I have stability I mean I had a growing SAS business but it isn't the 20 years stability I would kept thinking am I going to be doing this when I'm even 50 I'm 40 42 at the time am I gonna be doing this one I'm 50 that's only eight years out and it was like I don't know if I have I don't know if I have another eight years of this pace it might just kill me so Derek and I were talking like right what are we doing we're growing fast we can keep doing this I'm gonna slow growth we started talking about funding are we gonna just let's raise the small round you know do it 250 or 500 K is that gonna fix our stuff how long will it will it fix it and so we evaluated that we talked it through and their pros and cons especially in our in our shoes at the time right it would definitely have cut down on the monetary stress within the business because I was still hadn't paid myself back for all the money that I'd pulled out and I felt like just never having to put money in again and being able to take investor money would have been easier which is almost never the case if you ask someone who's done it but it was gonna delay profitability for years right because if you take the money then you're taking it at a pretty hefty valuation we weren't gonna value the company at 2 million boxer's something when we're doing seven figures in revenue so we're gonna take this hefty valuation and now we're in it for three five seven more years and I feel like by this time I'm like I don't know all right I don't know if I can do it for seven more years I don't know that I can commit to that so during this that we were evaluating this constantly every week every two weeks I'm like Derrick what you think about this what I think about raising money I talked to Anna about it I would would this look like and during this time 2015 is when acquisitions started coming in so we had a lot of offers of different types right so we had I got two to three maybe four emails a month with funding offers a lot of you in here to do that if you're on anybody's radar you get the junior you know junior person at a VC fund they're just doing lead jet and stuff some of them were more serious than others I will say I won't go into details but it would have been pretty easy to raise around I don't see that being a problem the more interesting thing was we had five potential acquirers inbound contact us who all have actually four of them had the money to acquire us at a multiple that made sense like a you know a startup multiple not not some some garage sale and that was interesting only in the sense that I really was not built we didn't build rip to sell it it wasn't on the radar before that but as we started getting this inbounder just interest it was like huh so what is the choice here you know we could sell we could raise this funding we could keep doing what we're doing maybe slow it down could grow out a revenue then one email came through this is one of the five actually and it was one that was perhaps the most interesting so it's from clay Collins and he says love drip interested in selling it would you ever consider selling drip I really like it and of course my answer was in my head like no really not interested right and then I gave it a little more thought and realized under what circumstances would I sell it reframed the question is there any does everyone have a number you know as Natalie said so I'm gonna have a number and it's not just a number right there are terms there are deal breakers so I started making lists and the nice part is I took six months I had retreats at all this stuff and I just kept making lists of what would it look like what would I one of my absolute deal-breakers that I will not sell for and what are the deal-breakers that if you know if someone delivered all this stuff that it would work again Derek's list was probably different we merged them in the end but this is just yeah I'm speaking for myself so I realized that perhaps for me stability 4.0 was sunset money is what I'm calling it so some people call it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you money but that's just not my style so I just I don't know it's just aggressive and like I'm not gonna tell anyone to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you but I came up with sunset money when someone asked someone on the podcast they said you sold your company it wasn't me they said sold your company's you have enough money to just ride off into the sunset and the guy said yeah I did and I thought I'm like that's a better way to say it like sunset money so I realized huh maybe that would make sense you know if I could if I could do it and never have to work again I don't know I think about it if the terms are right and so you know again as you look back at all these these things that I parlayed so I start you know I again working-class family I mean 17 bucks an hour my first job out of college and I program and I learned to code in 60 bucks an hour as a developer and then just bought dot an invoice bought the others bought hid tail and then those are gone take all the money from hid tail put it into drip and in you know what two years by this time we were this is um data nice and were tenth on that list right of market share of marketing automation and we were four people in a damn closet in Fresno and it's HubSpot it's Marketo and it's par dot and it's look above us el agua activecampaign and the sharp spring and then it's drip and it's like who are these freaking clowns like these guys even know what they're doing and so it was really like we had built something pretty special with a very small team and so it wasn't exactly something I wanted to be like yeah if they can offer us you know a million dollars we're gonna sell or if they can offer me enough sunset money I'm gonna be done because we we had I viewed drip as a once-in-a-lifetime thing for me I I don't know I don't I don't know if that's gonna happen twice for most people unless my name is Jason Cohen or heat and Shawn but what's good my name is not either of those so there are always objections to selling and this is what I started thinking through is why shouldn't I sell why should I sell objections objections to selling that you will hear especially in maybe our community of bootstrappers but maybe even for any startup founder is you know my startup is my baby I can't sell it and I always think of this like yeah that's a negotiating tactic like your your startups not your baby guys we all have kids and trust me you like even if they're my kids you like them more than then your startup I just I've never felt this way right I've had a lot of different apps and so this wasn't necessarily a deal-breaker for me I've heard this one interesting we talked about this at dinner last night selling is selling out and this is always said by someone who's never built a business that's worth selling I've never heard a founder at microcon tell me that selling is selling out it's always some guy when Mojang sold for a billion dollars right the Minecraft thing knotch this programmer would built this thing I was just like mad props dude a billion dollars that's insane and we were at some dinner that night and like a friend of ours again who had never had never been entrepreneur who's like not sold out and I'm like what does that even mean like what does that mean come on the guy busted his ass for years like so I just don't buy this I think this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what else would I do is another one I've heard laughs I sold my company what else would I do I hope you have an answer to this because if you don't have anything else but your company then you might need to talk to get some consulting from a really good trained psychologist like my way no I mean you need to have hobbies like what else would I do just off the top of my head this is not your list but my list is well I'm gonna run three conferences a year probably write another book I'm gonna do two podcasts maybe I'll start a third maybe I will I'd travel a little more maybe I'll spend more time with my family and kids that's what else I would do so the what else what I do think I've always thought like that sounds like an excuse so that's those are the those are the why not two cells reasons to sell now this is the interesting part we all think we hear about you know Zuckerberg coming in and buying Instagram in a weekend that never happens ever except for that one time and how you like that never ever except for the one time but the thing is is that you will hear countless tales if you if you poke into and actually look at sales you'll hear a lot of people that ride their the ride their company over the top for one reason or another you'll ride it and it's growing man whoo we're just honoring and then something happens and it maybe you've maybe you lose your CTO maybe you have a big outage and these people maybe you just you hit that plateau because we all hit a plateau or churn meets your acquisition and eventually once you hit the plateau you're not worth nearly as much I'm talking multiples less and it may even move from where you're talking revenue multiples down to like net profit multiples which is at you know a 10x or a 30x discount it's insane so the while you have while you're growing and y-you have inbound interest that's the other thing so let's say we hadn't you know we hadn't sold drip and then right now I'm totally burning out and you know I'm I'm want to sell it and we then go into the market to sell it that's not good because then you're trying to sell something you're gonna be taught you're not gonna be talking revenue multiple anymore you gonna be talking net profit multiple just such a different it's a different orders of magnitude so this is where the startups are bought not sold thing comes from you've probably heard this before when you have inbound interest there is a school of thought that says strike while the iron is hot because that inbound interest is not going to be there forever you're not going to be as hot in a hot market as you are you know because marketing automation was was was a hot thing it still is but there's only so many years that's gonna happen it's not gonna last for a decade where everybody wants to buy marketing automation so it's hard to look you know when you if you get inbound interest it's hard to just say no I think I have heard regrets so as we're going through the process I talked to several founders some of whom sold and some of who didn't the ones who didn't sell most of them regretted not selling when they did because if they sold later then they had you know a lower multiple the other thing is is this is the really counterintuitive one the best time to sell is when you don't need to sell when you're going fast when everything's going up into the right because once your plateau then you're worthless so my oh this is yeah and this is the best quote here on this topic once again Jason Cohen bring in the Thunder even when he's not here so you wrote a blog post about him selling his company it's called rich or King and he says see it's good to be king King is when you run your company forever it's a DHH thing right original Spolsky it's good to be king what do you do when you're at Trudy's notice Northstar tex-mex restaurant tucking into a chile relleno and the guy across the table looks you in the eye and offers you enough money that you never have to work again [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gets real it's interesting to talk about it in the in the theoretical and to say selling is selling out but what do you do when someone looks you in the eye and said your kids college paid for and if you want to give you know if given the choice you never have to work again and that number by the way for different people is totally different right some people in this room might need 10 million and never have to work again other people maybe it's one or two but there's you know maybe it's maybe it's a hundred for some folks but it's really fascinating to think about this so yeah this was the the process and the thought and there my reply back to the story clay Collins emailed June 2015 and he says I'd like to buy it would you be willing to sell it and my reply was after consulting with Derek of course I'm flattered that you would consider acquiring drip drip is growing quickly and we're profitable so selling now would need to make a lot of sense for me and you were here a couple years ago so you probably remember how that feels and I went from there okay the story there I realized during this time as I said I came up with my deal-breakers on retreats and other things and I had four deal-breakers one is that since I did genuinely see this as my last one I had it had to be sunset money cuz there was no I wasn't gonna do this again so I had to be able to you know given my current assets and whatever else is going on I had to be able to kind of compile all this and feel comfortable giving math and retirement yeah I don't need to work anymore you know I did not want anyone to lose their job the team is just too precious to me it still is I didn't want to screw our customers meaning I didn't want the roadmap to go in some weird direction I didn't want the product to get shut down as a lot of startups do and I had to keep doing what I do right this is the teaching so I wanted to keep doing podcasts and micro golf and such and so turns out there was one a choir that was really on board with this and in fact suggested some of these before I even did and that was the cool part and of course that was that was leadpages you know the end of this so this is what acquisition activity this is one we do have dive into like what this actually looked like from from inside this is what the activity looked like for about a year from his first email all the way to the day it closed and this is the number approximately of back-and-forth via email or I think voxer I think those of the two and so you can see clay made first contact in June of 2015 he sent that email I replied with the reply you saw and we we kind of went back and forth and then things kind of drifted that's actually when they raised their round they raised a I think it was a twenty eight million dollar B round and it was to acquire companies was right in that month and so I was like oh cool they're actually serious about this and then things just kind of you know you can see July August September they were almost zero contact I you know I don't know I can't speak for what was going on there I don't know if they were busy or I don't know if my reply scared him off right my reply was kind of like needs to be worth my while you know kind of it was a negotiating thing I mean they think that's there was a lot of that coming from both sides as there will be in a deal of this size I think once someone makes contact with you every interaction from then on as part of a negotiation some a friend of mine advised me on that and I thought it was I wouldn't have thought of that it was pretty clever so in October so got back in touch you know with me again and that was when they really asked for like what what did the numbers really look like because I think I just given him a blanket mr are but they want to turn you know they wanted like numbers and then what my turn grid all that stuff so that was when it was like necessarily know like should be signing India I don't know if the standard is and that's what I talked to to Thomas at Fe International I'm actually doing Qi with him tomorrow QA up here tomorrow about buying and selling businesses but they you know are definitely better at this stuff than we are right well you will do in our lifetime right each of us max one or two of these whereas a company like fe e or you know whoever else you were to find to represent you they're gonna do hundreds and the person on the other side of the deal is going to be doing hundreds typically they have someone you know big company doesn't just hire Joe Blow founder to do something they actually have experts if they're gonna spend a lot of money on a company so that was when I did that and then we again went we went back and forth and then you know stuff just kind of trailed off December and January we launched workflows which is our visual builder we don't sat at the end of January and that's when we really started getting into stuff and and it got really stressful I was at the beginning of the year and that's when you know you see a number on a piece of paper and you're like I Derek and I walked out into a parking lot because we couldn't tell the team you know that we were like can't even considering this because you don't derail everybody and you feel guilty because you're keeping a secret from them but Derek and I walked out in the parking lot and I'm like shake and I'm like I can't even but this is it just got real man there's like a number on that thing that there's a lot of zeros and and so that was this was the negotiation back and forth we couldn't agree on a price and then we reconnected so this is it I'm showing you this it feels tedious right just on this slide this was a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] year of my life I mean it was talk about tedious and a year of my family's life to talk to Sherry about it later on you know so then we agreed on a price eventually we signed a letter of intent got lawyers involved and what it yeah I was about a month or two later that we closed July 1 of 2016 incidentally I'll talk about this a little later but we started telling the team like two weeks before it closed and I think that was absolutely the right decision because you you just can't you can't distract your team it's so distracting to to be going through this alright last sections coming up we got that we got to finish this one off though you look into the mirror you see what you saw and you grab the saw you saw the table in half two halves make a whole you kind out the whole this guy's got swagger all right so last section here so reflections on this and what's cool is I so I gave a good chunk of this talk in Europe but I'm I was like why would think we were 60 days you know past acquisition nine months now so I really have a lot you know some thoughts and reflections so July 1 of 2016 yes we were we required and it it we made it public I think a week later because you just got a right press releases all this stuff and and they announced that now you probably were thinking July 1 of 2016 this was me right perhaps even this both Derek and I but indeed I was at with that same funny kid I was at a chess zukie cello camp and I was who key cello you're supposed to or strings at all you're supposed to be in with the child as the you as the instructors doing stuff and you're kind of working with them and I like this is fun they look at me like why is your foot your phone supposed to be out there and I'm like I gotta sign documents excuse me and so I run run out and I'm feeling like so ashamed you know and I'm like signing this deal size on my damn phone and it was just the irony of it I'm just like this is it though but like relationships right like I was there for the kid the kid no so it was a it was a fun time it was a fun time and that's when you know Derek texted me with a screenshot of the bank account where I was like whoa all right here a couple takeaways and then and then I'll wrap up if you have if you go through this it's going to take a long it takes a long time you saw from the that graph that is absolutely typical from all the research I did I listen to audio books on this I listen to there's entire podcast that just interview people who've had real acquisitions like this not Instagram and TechCrunch and all that crap but the people who really sell in our in our space for like a nice you know like an actual acquisition it's gonna take a long time it's gonna take longer than you think and absolutely longer than you want it to period so you have to the one piece of advice I would give you is to run your business as if you are not being acquired because if we had suddenly stopped hiring stop spending money on ads stop done anything different the day that clay acquire a uh you know emailed me we would have had a year of just I don't know what slow growth we would have imploded we mean you just can't do that you don't know how long it's gonna take so right up until the last minute I mean it was like maybe two weeks before I was still telling sherry I just don't know if this gonna go through I don't know if this gonna go through and she's like you we can't do that we're like moving dude we're moving to Minneapolis so you really this was a mistake people said that they made pretty commonly in these interviews with folks who had sold their businesses that they started like trying to keep the hard cash or not hire do weird things and you just can't do it we hired two people within you know three or four months before the acquisition closed and you know it is what it is it was a good decision the last thing I talked about earlier is like it is so distracting for everyone but firewall them until the last possible days and and it's tough and I went Derek or I or both of us went and sat down with every member of our team there were only eight of us so we were able to do that individually we went and we said I'm gonna tell you news that's gonna I'm gonna tell you something that's gonna sound like bad news at start but trust me it's it's gonna be good for all of us and then we went through it and in the end I actually if you asked anyone on our team I think they would agree that it was it was good for all of us in the end there's a bunch of good stuff that happened that I don't have time to talk about but in the end the reasons that went through lease for me are that none of my deal-breakers were ever even questioned or ever even you know not not on the table as terms and when I think about it you know does long term does this give me freedom yes absolutely and even in the short term it gives me freedom to not have to be worrying about the business so much do I still have the purpose of growing drip yes cuz Derek and I and the team are still everybody's still there right we all all are still working on the app does it give me more time for relationships absolutely and does it give me my stability 4.0 and yeah it does so what happened next we were all given that the choice of you know moved to Minneapolis or not in the Apple is a really cool City so flash forward a couple months and this was me walking to work in my Han Solo almost frozen in carbonite outfit it was 30 below that day and that was a new experience for me yeah I'm in the lobby of leadpages that's it's crazy and then this is sherry and I our I think our six year old and she has a water bottle in her hand because it was so cold that day the snow doesn't stick together it was let me say that again so called snow doesn't stick together where do we live so it was it was not like this all the time but it wasn't it was a shocker so they're trying to build a snow fort and she's spraying it with water it was insane and then I pulled my phone out to take a picture and it promptly died because it was literally 20 below on the phone like the battery freezes up or something so that's the it's the Minnesota joke I know Minnesota is actually really cool and then this is us in Cancun getting away from it and this is two days ago and Minneapolis is back to looking like this this is one block from our house with Minneapolis in the back so it's definitely been a good move for the family trip became drip from leadpages and we have a really good acquisition I'm sorry integration with them now and I've personally a lot of stuffs changed for the team in terms of more resources and stuff again from my perspective I've been able to hand off HR and legal payroll benefits these are not things I personally enjoy most of operations hiring support personnel and more Derek and I focus on the product a lot we hire engineers we've tripled our engineering team in the past six months nine months I guess and so far it genuinely a bunch of people have asked me before you know today like does this feel like a win type thing and so yeah we it's kind of cool to be able to grow the product with resources of a funded company but I didn't have to raise the funding I've handed off most of the work I didn't enjoy and I've achieved that stability and I genuinely and I'm not just saying this like I have not there's never there has not been a day since the acquisition close that I've woken up and thought man I really I really wished I hadn't done that it hasn't happened and Derick and I were having beers two weeks ago and I asked him out of the blue have you ever had any regret you know and he said nope so it feels good it you have a year to think about something you agonize over it enough I think you eventually probably make the choice that's right so there's some potential drawbacks of selling obviously there's a bunch leaving money on the table could be one right because we're still growing so yeah if I sold now we probably would've sold four more because you have more revenue that's something yet I think about working for someone else could be could be a crappy one we've actually had a pretty good transition in and I've really really enjoyed working for them it's a good team and they've left us relatively autonomous which has helped a lot and then obviously you could lose control of your product this we didn't we still own the roadmap in general and obviously if your identity is tied to your product if it's the only thing you've ever built and it really is your baby then maybe it'll be tough for you so I want to leave you with one thought and this is the thing this was a question that I've thought about and when I posed this to other founders who have sold they said man that helps me feel so clear about why I made that decision question is this if you had the opportunity for a deal structure that works for you and sunset money is it worth saying no for a chance at two times that amount or three times is it worth the risk that's a question you can add you may say yes you may say no but I think you know what my answer is I'm at a time thank you so much for listening [Applause] so Rob have you bought anything ridiculous yet oh that's it I've been asked that on a bunch of question sherry knows what it is so until about three months ago the answer is no and then I Drive a crappy I would have a beat-up car you know that's I just always have but I was I liked investing so I've been investing in stocks and all this stuff and a little bit of golden Bitcoin and all that but I realized that collectibles is a good way to to diversify and when I was a kid I used to when I was a kid I used to collect comic books and I now have the money to buy some really expensive comic books so I have you know you can you get graded in this like slab and they're all like collectible so yeah I've spent a lot of money in the past like four months on I know an amazing spider-man number one Fantastic Four number one amazing fantasy 15 keep going on so yes they're in a safe deposit box but damn that's been fun I didn't realize it I could give a crap about the Lamborghini but this stack of comic books that I have is so it's so embarrassing I go I pull them out I like look at the front can't read them because they're like encased in this slab and then oh yeah this was worth this is this all worth it freedom purpose relationships an epic comic books relationship with a comic book yeah thanks for that talking transparency it was super insightful how stable was the revenue meaning if you had decided to to milk it cut costs fire everybody that you thought you could get away right insider yeah you know extreme no country no good for values etc yeah how quickly do you think the revenue would have evaporated and related to that how could you have gotten anywhere close to that level of payout in profits just by milking it over an extended period of time what are your thoughts it's a good question I actually did the analysis and I talked it through it with Ruben one day on a call Ruben from Beit sketch and we were doing loose math but we we did say exactly that what if I I would wouldn't couldn't been able to fry everybody but let's the say we had you know I said what if we just cut it down to a couple people and did exactly that because the revenue was definitely stable right I mean it was just going up into the right at SAS it eventually would have trailed off but by our estimations it was and this this is gonna sound like it's in my favor but after we did it we were like oh that's pretty interesting it was it was ten years ten years to get the same amount of money yeah and I'm not that doesn't imply any multiple right but that's just I'm saying based on our our calculations it was going to be take ten years for there to be that much net profit as as what we're gonna get out of it so yes sir so after this acquisition how has the leadership change changes occurred in drew yeah in drip are you like CEO and then you built a leadership team because I saw operations up yeah how does that work now yeah so really we just came over as a you know leadpages already had has two software products and we just came in as a third business unit or Department and so we had a support person who merged in with with leadpages support and they started a little drip support pod so I don't hey man it's support but there's we went from one to seven full-time support people in nine months as an example operations really was just handed up to the corporate if that makes sense so I yeah I am NOT a general manager right I don't want to run like a big organization that's part of the thing of being able to hand off these pieces around product but then product we were our own little department so we've not merged engineering of drip with say engineering of leadpages because we do things differently right they're a much like maybe 40 engineers or something and we're eight right now so you just have to have different processes so it feels again it feels kind of like the best of both worlds so far you know there's always there's trade-offs I had a really tough time giving up like the marketing side it's the first start clay it was like we're gonna redo the marketing stuff but every blind of copy every video it's my voice you know and but he was right and I'm so happy to not be doing that anymore it's funny the things you think you really want to do until they're not there so yeah hey Rob could you tell us a little bit about what they were all fe played in advising you in this process yeah FFA International yeah a big role it was a big sanity check for me there were a couple things so they were essentially like an investment banker or a broker on on my side and they were able to tell me I'd get these terms in this contract and I'm like so you're gonna retain this much and there's a percentage here and it's like is this normal or is someone trying to take advantage of you and so I would ask them and they would say yeah that standard man you just you can't you're not gonna negotiate out of that every deals like that and that was or they would say this one you know this line here has negotiating room so that was really the role it was the sanity check and then even a sanity check on when we were talking back and forth with leadpages about let's say numbers or different terms you know Effie brought up like you know maybe figure out try to get me try to get as much as you can in writing by the time you hit the letter of intent because once you signed a letter of intent it's it's exclusive until it closes unless you guys back out right so you really don't want you don't want to just agree on price by the time you get to an LOI you wanna agree on like price and terms and you know there's typically like under now or you have to work a certain amount of time and salaries and are the employees coming with you and water their salary I mean there's a lot of stuff and so they've really front-loaded it which felt uncomfortable but I think was the right choice because then by the time we really got into due diligence it was kind of like Oh most of this is decided that was really a pain in the ass but now we're here so it was it was a good position again they have and will go through hundreds of you know acquisitions and I'm gonna have just a couple basically so my question goes back to where you were basically saying I didn't really have freedom I really didn't have you know my relationships were suffering and I didn't really have the stability that I wanted and I kind of identify with being in that place right and I think I'm sure I'm not the only one but I don't think an acquisition is really going to help me out and so I'm wondering you know are there other ways of achieving that or do you have advice for somebody who's in that position and trying to see their way past it so that they can regain some of that freedom and some of the stability and time for the relationships yeah that's a good question right because this was just my path right I mean this was not a framework or anything it was kind of the road I traveled over these 11 or 12 years I think I don't know that I have an easy answer for that I think that if if I had something that was uh Nicole I think that the relationship piece is the one that doesn't necessarily depend on an acquisition I think it can be a more of a state of mind and that may be that may be mean conversations with you know a therapist to consult in a psychologist somebody they'll kind of smack I would have loved have been smacked around and been like dude here's what you need to do you need to carve out time for your kids you need to carve out time for your wife we need to do this I actually think that when I could have achieved it was more of my mental it was not a time thing if that makes sense that's probably the easiest one to fix is to get somebody to smack you around a little bit so to speak the freedom one is a little tougher right because if you really do need to work 10 or 12 hours a day in order to make the business run I'm not sure other than outsourcing its stuff we're hiring like you know you ask the question to Natalie or today about what if I can't afford to hire so I'm not sure that that's gonna get us all it but that's I haven't thought about that a lot to be honest so I don't have you know a great answer I think yes sir hey um so question I've got is what gave you the confidence to invest the the money from from hit tell in to drip was it a case of you had a gun to your head cause he tells going down was because you really wanted to see email marketing automation in the world was it because you had product market fit and you knew you just had to put more money in what gave you the confidence to to invest that money yeah I think I think it was like that's a really good question by the way it was a couple things one it was confidence in I've had successes in the past you know this drip was not my first rodeo and I felt like I had the skills to do it I'd built the skills to do it another is I knew that I had a network in an audience you know I had network of people I could go to to say hey influencer or hey friend like I know you have an audience like I I knew that I had the pieces to make it work and I just I was fairly confident that that would happen another thing was working with Derek I just knew we we tend we build good software together you know and I knew that if we it's not always the best product that wins but I knew we could build a damn good product that was it and I wasn't a hundred percent sure but I felt like we were on to something especially when folks I had there were there were signposts along the way right Brandon Dunn was one of our very early customers Rubin from bid sketch Jeff from ambassador he's a good product people and they kept saying this has this has something but like you just need one more thing and they were different people drusen aki is another guy and they kept saying add automation i think you get there and so as the automation started trickling and the revenue went up i was like oh we're not getting there fast enough but i think i can add more flames to this fire so it was a balance of getting some positive signals back and also feeling finally for maybe the first time i felt confident enough in my own entrepreneurial ability you know yeah I probably should have felt that way of years ago but it took that long to build it in me hey Rob I just got one of those emails recently so this has been super relevant cool how how did you think about your personal freedom with in any kind of acquisition offer for any kind of leader of a company there's usually some amount of time where you're tied up at that company and whether that made a difference to you or didn't I was surprised that it wasn't on your list of for deal breakers zero-day yeah I want to work for somebody else for zero days type thing question was how important was it for me personally I had listened and read and done enough research that I realized that there's only two startup acquisitions in kind of realistic space that I've ever heard of where the owner doesn't have to go with the company so I just that was never even a not really a question you know I knew that I was gonna have to go for some period of time IRA also realized that I disliked working for companies in the past I disliked my jobs because I often worked with people I didn't necessarily like or respect I often didn't have the autonomy or the control I you know there were a bunch of reasons I didn't like it it isn't that I hate working for anybody else you know I'm not a complete sociopath it's only half a sociopath it um and so I started weighing that especially you know you build a relationship right clay Collins we hit he'd been on the podcast we had talked like I I came out and met people Derek and I flew out and met people leadpages and I'm like it's kind of cool I've never we're gonna start off like that you know they have the whole shebang and it just felt like a creative environment that we could potentially thrive in and we were going with our gut that I think this could work you know and of course there was there's negotiation around all of that there's duration and there's you know what that looks like but that wasn't a deal-breaker for me yeah and I don't regret it I don't feel nine months in like I've just pissed away nine nights of my life like I don't feel like that at all I could you feel like I've learned a ton right you work with I consider leadpages and I did before I used to say this leadpages I think is one of the best in the world at top of funnel marketing like they're they're amazing SAS marketers and so I've been inside that engine for nine months like tell me that's not kind of a cool tour you know I've also seen how they run development and it was a big team and I just learned a ton about I think from a much larger company because they're a hundred and seventy hundred and eighty and I've seen how a pretty efficient well-funded startup at that scale works and I've never been exposed to that aside from you know social network or Silicon Valley or something you're up so here's how the team reacted to that like you know where they nervous you know what kind of questions they ask yeah how did the team react was a question almost almost without fail it I said I'm gonna tell you something that it's gonna sound like bad news but trust me it's gonna be good for us just follow me you know give me a few minutes to explain almost without fail everyone was like oh yeah I'm in and we even had someone was like are you moving and I was like I don't know and on the spot it was like if you're moving I'm moving like we started getting that we had a small team and we all very loyal to one another like I would back them up when [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hit the fan in terms of customers or you know it's stuff coming and I felt like they backed us up you know they backed me and Eric up there was one one person had been at two separate startups that it each been acquired over the past several years and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] had just gone sideways and so that was a different story we kind of he's that's fine but I'm sure stuff's gonna you know but it was what it was he's like oh you know I'll hang around and see what happens and so we're nine months and of course he still works with us you know he still works for us so we definitely handle it with kid gloves though right we didn't get everybody in a room and and then and make some big analysis what's happening here's her HR paperwork people I mean it it was a lot of time and and I don't I don't regret you know spending that time to kind of help everybody this is a shock when you hear this you know to kind of help everybody get used to it I'll take one more question after this and an earlier slide you shared startups are bought no and you also shared that you were approached multiple times yeah did you leave some breadcrumbs or tea leaves how did how do these companies when you're a private company how did they recognize that you were gaining market share or their studies showing the market leaders yeah I would they cut why were they coming to you good point there good question we well what's the one one advantage we have is we had the widget with the powered by drip and people started seeing it everywhere right the little UI pop up even without that we were numbered like I said number ten on day denies and people look at that stuff we were we got written up in places like market know what was it I'm sorry a VentureBeat which is that like a big VC back thing they chose us they did a big analysis of all these marketing animation they chose us as the choice for a small business you know a thing and it's like this upstart unfunded upstart in Fresno California so once that happened actually we got a ton of like inbound funding interest and I don't know if some of these people heard about it there but it just you just kind of go you know SAS turd Jason Lemkin he says when you hit cuz we were we were doing seven figures in revenue right that's no secret to anybody he said when you hit about one one-and-a-half million in ARR you develop what's called a mini brand and you're not a brand like GE yet but everyone kinda has heard of you you know you in at least in that space that the people at least know who you are and if when they here acquire is like people people who haven't raised funding because they don't have to deal with investors and they know that the it's the price is probably going to be less than if you'd raised a bucket of money so if they do then here that your bootstrapped it's actually you're a better target you know not a target in a bad way but actually you know a good acquisition potentially last one sir if you couldn't have found any anyone who would have honored all of your deal-breakers and you didn't get acquisition in this period who that have been fine were you at a point where you really wanted to get out nope I was for all that I portrayed there like 2014 was really hard we were genuinely past that we may we may have raised it some of that small round because cash was constraining her growth lack of cash was constraining it but yeah I would not actually don't think I would have imploded I don't think certainly that the team wouldn't have imploded like ya know we'd still be run in the business it was it was profitable it was growing everything I told clay was true but it's just you know that the things all all met stars align does this a thank you very much
