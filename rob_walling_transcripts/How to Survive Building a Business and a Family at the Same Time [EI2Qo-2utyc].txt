[Music] yeah when I was 17 I somehow ended up in a sweat lodge with an elder asking on the day that you died what will be what will you think of as the most valuable thing you did with your life so what'd you think oh I wish I had watch more Netflix would you think gee I wish I bought more stuff so it's not like there's any right or wrong answers to this question but we tend to get real with what's essential and what's not when thinking of it this way when the time comes for me I'd like to be thinking I'm so grateful that I had so much freedom love inspiration and meaning in my life and I'm so happy that I passed these feelings to the people that I love around me so how do you end up dying like that it's definitely easier said than done one thing I realized is that taking investment in my business would most probably not bring me any closer to that for why well I'm gonna cite Dan Martell and sorry Rob and tiny seed I'm stepping on your business here but investments are for scaling a profitable business anything else is going to take the control away from you and into the hands and minds of those who do not care about you or why and if you like we can discuss afterwards another thing I realized was that rushing for growth by all means would not either why because when you are under pressure in one aspect of life family for example stability and security are critical that's why so many people never realize their dreams in my case I've had periods when I was under a lot of pressure and to work on marketing tasks was draining my energy whereas improving the product energized me so that's what I focused on in those periods knowing that I was sacrificing the growth that a bit of marketing effort would have given me so to be able to stay in control and grow slowly I chose to build a business in a niche that's part of a vast industry my main inspiration to do so was a small Danish company called Church this anybody heard of them there's one wow that's that's cool okay so Church desk is there making it as CMS or internet like solution to churches and they focused at that point on Protestant churches at the west coast of Danish region Jutland so that's kind of niche to me but it's also pretty directly otaku and homogeneous one as well they pretty much only precisely the same features and they don't need anything too complicated so if Church this could do business like that it should I should be able to do as well see I don't need a huge turnover to get to a point where my ultimate goal is in reach all I need is financial independence so this strategy seems to be for me the business I created was a SAS one and the product focuses on sales people doing cold calling we fill a gap in the crm market we're tailoring a workflow for the low prestige and often neglected top of the funnel became our niche and what you see here is one of the very early landing pages of the product so at the time I nailed this I had been doing a handful of startups in different constellations I had been out running after the monument on several occasions and I had failed in multiple different ways I also met my wife son who was nearly 2 years old when I met them and we had decided to get another child together at this point we needed stability and security so I decided to go for the long haul I took a day job and work on my phone in the evenings and weekends this seemed like a sound decision and the way was paved for my success but then life got hard my wife has had a pretty bad concussion she's still not back working full-time after five years at the age of six my son made a drawing of his family in school it was his mother in bit and his father sitting in front of his computer working devastating reality I had to get up in the morning feed the kids bring them to kindergarten in school go to work to make money pick up the kids in the afternoon buy groceries cook food clean the kitchen put the kids to bed and then work on my phone my wife could do one of these things every day but only one as time passed my wife became more and more desperate and nervous about her concussion worrying if she would ever be her old self again naturally this was a worry of mine as well so something had to happen I was not happy in my day job and I was frustrated that nothing I care about neither my wife my kids or my startup could get the care and attention they needed I believe many people experience something similar at some point and for some it leads to divorce giving up on their dreams of failing to raise their children with love and care and attention it's a real crisis and there are no easy answers no solution offers real relief so does anybody in the room listen eight for this one two three four five okay more small hands okay good thank you guys I hear stories when I tell my story people start talking and I think a lot of people experience crisis maybe not exactly the same but experienced crisis along the way so I had to figure out what to do but it was not easy I felt stuck I don't think I need to explain to you guys why I couldn't just give up on my startup it's in our blood right I would die a slow painful death by only working for other people obviously I couldn't fail my kids I couldn't stop making money and I couldn't leave my sick wife but I also couldn't continue like this for long it was mentally unhealthy and would lead to stress burnout conflict dysfunctional kids and not the freedom love inspiration and meaning I was striving for so eventually we took three actions I quit my job we sold the apartment and moved to the countryside and started spending a nice portion of our monthly budget on therapy from then on things started to improve slowly it's cheaper to live in a house in the countryside than in central Copenhagen my employer offered me work as a freelancer instead and I could certainly make the money I needed working hot this way my phone will keep growing slowly and eventually it overtook freelancing as the primary source of revenue for my company my wife got better and our kids of which we now have three our relatively sane and apparently I'm adhering to the tradition by showing pictures of my family so today I'm inches away from making the money I need to sustain my current lifestyle for my father alone which basically after adjusting ambition and being thoughtful about the meaning of life many times means that I'm inches away from living my dream all right so takeaways is a few segways that I think may be valuable first we've heard it before it's like you know pick your niche there you go thinking - within the vast area of CRM systems you had Stella say it's like a little bit competitive space but it's also a huge space and there's room for nice products and it meant less pressure on performance in terms of growth that's because I can adjust my price for the limited number of features I have as long as a core functionality is nailed I have many customers who only need very very cool features and if the price remains low enough I can compete on that alone and from there I can add features in the pace that I decide and extend my audience slowly all based on feedback and requests from current customers so picking your niche and then be in control I'm actually quite often reassured that even though it took a long time and was an economic struggle at times then not taking any investment up until this point has been the right thing for me to do being able to put things on standby at times to prioritize and care for my family has been key to staying sane and staying together to have my stop i've also be my happy by working on the tasks I find energizing what's helping me get through some of the tough times and prizes is opportunity so I've heard people say that in Chinese the word crisis is composed two characters one represents danger and the other represents opportunity so my story proved that that to me in a few ways for example there's nothing I regret about quitting my job there's nothing I regret around moving to our wonderful house in the countryside and there's really nothing I regret about attending therapy sessions I'm actually really really happy about it but if it hadn't been for that crisis we may not have been doing it like that and the last thing I have for you today is keep thinking about the day you got thank you [Applause]
