[Music] so I'll just get right into it so since last micro comm had a pretty exciting year let's see I sold my last business restaurant engine that was about midway through 2015 it was a six-figure exit huge learning experience really exciting and I also launched my current company audience ops which I'm going to talk about most of this talk here today but if that wasn't enough I also hit the road with my family and our two-year-old our dog packed him in the car and basically lived in different places around the u.s. for the last six or seven months just returned back to Connecticut and so that was a lot of fun to kind of travel and you know enjoy time with my family but also work on the road and work on this new business launch it grow it from Airbnb s from coffee shops a lot of times literally from the car so it was a lot of fun kind of exciting so today I'm gonna be talking about audience opps that's my current company we are a content marketing company launched initially as a productized service where we basically do a done-for-you blog writing content promotion service for software companies mostly b2b online services that sort of stuff this is the this is basically the story of the past 11 months or so oh and by the way the the concept for audience apps I literally formed the idea and started writing the initial notes of what became audience house while I was here in Vegas one year ago for Micro Kampf literally going into micro Kampf I did not know what my next business was going to be by the end of micro Kampf I knew exactly what it was gonna be I didn't know the name but within 30 days of micro Kampf last year it launched we had about three paying customers about five within the first two months so pretty quickly we got up to about five five to six mr are five to six kmr are in the first month so that that was good because it helped us learn a lot really quickly we started delivering the service you know learning what it takes to deliver a service like this and figuring out that the beginnings of our process and around two or three months in I kind of intentionally paused all sales to just focus on our process our systems get some people in place and really get that nailed down so that we can start to scale and and you know support the capacity required for a product I service like this about six or seven months in I kind of opened sales back up and started ramping up sales every month since it's been growing pretty rapidly just a couple days ago I think we crossed 38 km RR it's been profitable since the beginning continues to be we're at about fourteen people right now and growing so I'm just kind of trying to manage this growth and and learn my way through it I'm not really used to working in a in a in in a business that's growing this fast especially in in terms of people and client lists and revenue so a lot to learn and that's what I'm gonna be talking about right now so the first thing that I want to talk about is better fundamentals going back a year ago I was thinking long and hard many months over you know so I was exiting this first business trying to figure out what my next business is gonna be and I wasn't really sure what that was gonna be yet but one thing kept circling around my mind and that's I want to make sure that I get the fundamentals right or at least make them better than they were in my last business and what I'm talking about when I say fundamentals are the the things that the big building blocks of a business I'm not talking about things that you can just tweak or improve incremental II overtime over the course of growing your business I'm talking about the things that can only really be figured out from the very outset when when you're first starting up when you're forming the idea of what business to start and so for me two things came up here one was picking the right market and what I'm really talking about is picking the right market for me so in my previous business we were selling a website design SAS service to the restaurant industry I have no personal connection to the restaurant industry and that I mean I kind of hustle it in and and you know pushed through it for about four years but that really became a pretty big challenge to growing this bit this you know when I don't have this personal connection to this community so I knew that in my next business I wanted to focus on something that served online businesses software companies online services and that brought two key benefits number one in the short term it allowed us to get our very first clients very quickly and that and we continue to see that benefit you know people that I know in my in my networks people that I warm emailed early on folks are my audience they they know about audience they refer that they refer audience opps but the long-term benefit of picking the right market is that it allows me to go long on this one I'm gonna be energized I continue to be energized and interested to keep pushing and keep doubling down on audience hops because I'm solving problems for my peers problems that that I have that I've had in the past that I continue to have that's something that I'm obviously really passionate about as I'm sure everybody in this room is passionate about you know doing for your customers so that's something that I just continue to push on the other fundamental that that I had in mind as I was forming you know the idea for the next businesses this idea of aspirational pricing I've heard Rob talk about it a bit I've heard other people talk about this idea of you know going after a problem that that allows you to to charge a higher price point obviously the simple math of charging more you know we kind of all know how that goes but but what it allowed me to do was open my mind up to tackling a much bigger problem that I then I may have otherwise thought about doing in say a $49 month sass getting into a four figure a month recurring price point we can start to look at a problem that is really tough or really you know just really tough to tackle but something that businesses are willing to pay for so the question that I want you guys to think about is how can you improve the fundamentals in your next business so whether you're starting something new or you're transitioning like I was from one thing to the next you know something to think about and I'm gonna have these these questions as I go along the next one that I'll just kind of rush through right here is a fire yourself so I talked about early on spent about three three months or so really refining our systems pausing sales just kind of doing the wait waiting list thing we've got a creative process that basically allows the service to to deliver without me being there I mean I'm here in Vegas audience ops this week is producing somewhere between 40 and 50 blog articles for our for our clients this week you know from the writer and goes to the editor goes to the graphic designer the project manager the assistant all this stuff is getting done with with really talented people and it's a creative process but it's a process we're doing things in a very methodical way we've got a really strong production line that allows me to you know not necessarily get involved in the day-to-day or not require me to to get involved in a day-to-day operation of the business but it's now also getting to the point where okay we're year in and I'm starting to look at the things that I am doing every day like I've been doing all the sales and all the marketing so I recently hired a sales person and a marketing person to start to remove myself from from those things I'm basically firing myself from things that I've been doing and the reason for that is to basically allow me to focus on building and that's that's really the the the last bit that I want to talk about and so that's the question that I want to give you here is is what is one job that you're currently doing that you should fire yourself from and what would that allow you to do and what would that really look like and so that's the last bit here is to focus on building I think that's something that we should all be striving for no matter what type of business you're working in we're founders we're entrepreneurs we're we are builders and that is the the thing that we add the most value to our business not customer support not necessarily coding or pushing pixels around obviously we're all going to be doing these things that at one point or another but the idea is to is to give yourself the time and the oxygen to focus on building and focus on growing the product line in my case with audience ops we've established ourselves with the productized service but now now we're growing that that product line we've already released to WordPress plugins so we're getting a little bit into the software space later this year we'll be releasing a training product around content marketing these are products all to the same audience but all coming from audience opps and I'm spending my time working on these you know building out the expansion building out our product line expanding our footprint while remaining under the umbrella of being a content marketing company and so that's that's really what I get to spend my time on and that's what excites me I'm sure that's what excites everyone in this room is building and and creating new things and doing that for a living I mean we get to do this for a living that's that's pretty that's pretty awesome you know but how how can we do or how did I do it in this case the how the question is how can we make this sustainable right how can we pay the bills how can we establish a company that that is sustainable that's continuing to grow that makes it worth your time worth your employees time and what I found in recent years is the product I service model I talk about a lot I teach about it what what it allows what it allowed me to do is give the time to give the business the time and oxygen that it needs to be sustainable and and so that's that's basically my talk and that's the last that's the last question that I want to leave you guys with here is what would it actually take to give your business more time and oxygen so that you can keep building I can't actually believe that I came in a little bit below 12 minutes but that's my personal site casting comm where I have a newsletter and I talk a lot I teach a lot about productized services there among other things I just recently set up a now page the Derek Siver's now page things that's up there and that's it if you guys want to talk or have any questions about this stuff I'll be around [Applause] you
