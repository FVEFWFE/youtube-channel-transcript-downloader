[Music] I'm excited to be here I'm chat a little bit about SEO because what I realized hanging out with you guys in the last days is that you start off with a product idea right you might be a developer you might be a technical person but once you start putting out your product all of a sudden you have all these responsibilities and marketing and sales and you're basically going through a second education becoming a marketer understanding panelists understanding your website so I have 12 minutes so I thought I give you guys a blueprint on how you can structure a website that makes sense for SEO and I want to give you some insights on how that strategy could look like the types of content you could be writing and how that overall layout could look like SEO is great because it can do this this is a client of mine which is a software business that I started working with in January of 2019 the blue line is organic traffic this year versus the fourth and it just means you can get a lot of eyeballs on your website if you can get it right and what you can also see this is kind of like a consistent increase in traffic over time so I quickly wanted to introduce this model to you which is an inspiration from Rand Fishkin who created a company called Mars which is an SEO tool and basically what he talks about is the difference of creating content for social media for your email list versus creating content for SEO which just means if you're writing content and you're putting out 5 blog posts a week 5 you know Facebook posts 5 LinkedIn posts every day every day is that you're in the travel you hassle to get faith so what happens is you see a spike of hope in your traffic once you put a post up and that is because your followers your fans your mom and your best friend they come to the website and when you publish a post and then the next day it falls down to zero the flat line of knowing what we're looking to do with SEO is to create evergreen content that can bring you sustainable new visitors to your website Google is still the largest traffic refer so it brings in 10 times more traffic than Facebook does sometimes people say like all there's Google traffic that's gonna be ads I just published a post or a graphics on my blog which actually showed that on desktop 60% of all clicks still go to organic and on mobile 40% so you probably don't want to be nothing out on that yeah and the only if I run an SEO agency and we work for a lot of software companies it's why I'm here today I'm gonna be really quick on this page one is the most relevant answer to search query right that's what we learned yesterday and that's the main thing that I want you to keep in mind and the other thing I want you to keep in mind that Google's algorithm it's not a human it doesn't process content and information the way we do it's an algorithm and hence it calculates relevance based on ranking factors the more ranking factors you can get right the better you going to rank now that means that most SEO processes look like this you get started with keyword research and figure out what are your customers your target audience what are they looking for what are they typing into Google and I don't really want to go into this as much the general gist of this is if you're starting out your prize - you should be becoming a big fish in a small pond which ultimately means like you don't need to pay for SEO tools month after month after month but you probably should be paying for an SEO tool a month or two and he want to choose low difficulty keywords right and then you start winning low difficulty keywords you become a big fish in a small pond and then over time you can pick a bigger pond but don't start out as a small website a small business banging your head against a wall with a super competitive keyword because you're really only going to see an increase in organic traffic once you hit the top position there's no good and being stuck on page 2 3 &amp; 4 Google right you want to make it to the top position the keyword research is going to help you identify those opportunities from there you want to choose you know technical infrastructure of your website then start content writing if you haven't written about it who can't rank you for it then build links to it which is basically with finding opportunities we're creating a structure we're building the foundation and then accelerate our rankings whittling and the thing is Google is very loving off structure and who will understand structure Google understands structure which means that Google's moved from a keyword specific understanding to an entity understanding so it does understand that apple pie recipe recipe for apple pie apple pie recipes it doesn't and this is all the same thing but you still have to make it very very clear this is my page about apple pie recipe this is my page about the Nana bread recipe and this is what I want you to run and my hypothesis is that you guys as technical people and developers that you guys have good way structure and that you understand hierarchy and relationships between objects right so you understand if you're using a programming language that has an object orientation you understand that certain parents certain parent object inherits characteristic to the underlying object and that's how Google processes information as well so the first rule of the Fight Club is optimize one page per keyword cluster which means that you want to have one page in one page only about apple pie recipe and you don't want to be pumping out core pages about this which also gets you off the dreadmill of content you hustle to win and the second rule of the Fight Club is you want to respect ontology which means the hierarchy of content and concepts between each other so let's look at the blue frame actually hope that you guys can read this I think most websites probably have three layers and the first layer I call the website core so this is where people come when they know your brand name when they've heard about you at a conference when you email them and Linkedin and they come to your website they come to your website and what they will find is they will find your homepage they will probably find an about page contact page Terms of Service the regular stuff and then they will find your product pages or product feature page pages and this is what I call the website core and the way I like to structure this for a software it's normally creating a header that looks something like that so probably in the header navigation of my website is I'm gonna have a list of all the products or features that I have right this is your brand name and then probably you want to break down your solutions by knee by industry payroll by task obviously not every website is going to have all those categories that's probably overdoing it but you probably want to segment your users based on use case or based on the role they have in the tasks that they are trying to perform and then probably you want a few case studies so these are the pages that you have next to your about page your home page right this is generally what we see if we go to a stock or business website is that's the structure we see now this is funny for SEO because now you're saying I thought now I would need to write my product page 20 times if that not going to be content duplication plus I don't want to write 20 sales pages like this seems like a mess and the way to think about this is that you can have this structure in the header to segment users for conversion but in terms of SEO you can probably read them to the same sales page so here I said as an example I don't know I have a product feature of visual reporting which satisfies the need of creating a monthly report which I outlined in my case that he wants so all of this can be on the same page and the interesting thing for SEO is that this column by need that's probably why you're picking your keywords this is like visual recording software it's like email automation for e-commerce it's like page build of WordPress whatever you keyword is that's probably gonna be in this column need and that's what you can want to be optimizing for SEO for even though people can find it different paths on your website as well yet so this is just another example of the same thing so which means that you don't have to write 20 sales pages and you know put on all that work if you can create get that structure right then we have the second layer of the website which we normally call SEO silos which means that we clustering content that is topically related together and I just want to give you guys a few I things that people normally look for number one is tutorials so you don't want people to necessarily go to YouTube or to someone else's blog if they're having an issue with their software right if they're like how to set up Ben Inc right email and drip but you want them to come to your website to find that so that in that tutorial there's going to be queries and keywords that you want to be optimizing for common problems that people have these are your knowledge base articles like that kind of stuff so that's the first type of like SEO cluster of things that you want to be doing and then second but small is called resources and reviewing comparison so these are interesting part of your website where you can talk how you compare to other players on the market so this is like MailChimp alternative ecommerce software for MailChimp this is your Savior integration from MailChimp to Google sheets to slack you know if your tool is replacing that these kind of like common things that people are looking for or they are looking for a cheaper than mail chamber or whatever they are looking for these kind of like comparing your tool to other players in the field and to other things that people are typing in and when they are trying to solve the issue which is normally xapi or other tools you want to have them all clustered together in that part of the website and all of this stuff is basically it's either your customers looking for a tutorial or it's people who are really ready to buy because they're solving a very specific problem and they're looking for tools right so if they're scouting for tools you want to make sure that you appear and the way you want to do this is you cluster those articles and the same part of your website and then the third part is I call silo and this is kind of like where your typical SEO content comes in so this part on the right here is where your content marketing your content writing your normal blog content that you normally think about probably comes in and even your normal blog content you want to break down and structure as well as possible and the reason why we're doing this is exactly that because people who come from organic search rarely come to your homepage they only come to your homepage if they search for a brand a term or for the overarching theme that you're trying to I'm successful with most of the people are coming into those blog posts through this tutorial it's knowledge base whether it's reviewing the power of their posts so for all your blog content I want you to keep this in mind which is basically is cluster your content based in two categories right so make sure that all your vegetable contents lives with the other vegetables or your fruit content with other fruit and the way you do this is you can use URL structure like domain.com slash fruit but it's mainly about internal linking you want to make sure that fruits link to fruits right and that vegetables link to vegetables and what this allows you to do is basically you're beating the authority of fake players by creating a tight structure and by creating relevance and this is the blueprint and the SAO ideas and if you can get together what you want to communicate what people are searching for and what Google would like to see which means the type amid relevance structure then you got to be successful and this is the red timer thank you very much [Applause] you
