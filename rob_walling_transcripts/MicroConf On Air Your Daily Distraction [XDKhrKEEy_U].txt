[Music] hi I'm Rob walling I'm the co-founder of micro comp thanks for taking a few minutes to hang out with me here today I don't expect this to take too long maybe five or ten minutes tops and I really just have two topics that I want to cover with you the first is to talk a little bit about micro comp growth and starter they were supposed to take place here in Minneapolis in the next month that we've had to postpone and told the fall and the second is a new effort that we're gonna do to try to get us all together if we can't get together in person we're gonna try to get together live via the interwebs and that's called micro comp on air so the first thing I want to talk about is you know this postponement of microcon growth and starter obviously very difficult decision to make in in retrospect it was the right decision at this point we would have had to postpone Micro cough and you know we really appreciate all the support from the community it's been overwhelming people have written and said look you know transfer my ticket we're we're okay to wait and here you know to wait this out and hear how things are gonna go so our current thinking on that is we're getting some dates for the fall and we're working on rescheduling that in essence and we will be in touch as soon as we have information and you know and just just keep you updated we still have Micro Kampf Europe that we're planning in October and we have our local events that are happening in the late summer and you know hopefully all of that is able to to go forward I know there's a lot of stress and anxiety I think you know in the world right now just kind of in the air and it feels like we almost need a distraction from that I think for you know some of the time I know we all need to pay attention to the news we need to be aware of the threat of koban 19 but I also feel like as a community like we can come together and you know and just just hang out for a little bit every day and and that's that's what we want to do we have this thing called micro comp on air that we are throwing together very spur-of-the-moment producers and ER and I had a conversation yesterday on the phone decided to do this and what we're gonna do is we're gonna do daily 30-minute live streams at noon Central Time five days a week with exception we're gonna try to do an afternoon happy hour shoutout to John Knox and Lana patch for kind of introducing that concept of of you know video happy hours but we think it's it's a great idea and so we're calling it micro comp on air and if it's gonna be 30 minutes every day at noon I would just mark your calendar right now I'm gonna have guests on I'm gonna be doing QA and we're gonna be doing like a micro comm 2019 almost like a video book club thing it's it's it's like a book club but it's for the micro comp talk videos from 2019 so for example next week we're inviting Craig Hewitt of cast osan and we're gonna release his talk from 2019 in Europe and from the microgram you're up 2019 and we're gonna release his talk that day or two before we will notify you you can watch the talk on your own time and just between you and I you video speed controller in Chrome so I can watch stuff at one point five or one point you know 1.75 X and then we're gonna meet live at noon central time on I don't remember what he's to say or Wednesday next week and he's gonna be available to answer any questions you have for him about his thought process about his talk really about anything you might have for Craig we're gonna be the same thing with Ben Ornstein who spoke at micro comm starter I believe last year in 2019 mmm-hmm excuse me and for this week we're we're throwing together a you know an all-star panel at the last minute the only guests we could get on such short notice for tomorrow is yours truly I have nothing to do is everybody you know everybody knows so I'm I'm pulling myself on here to do QA about one of my talks we're releasing a playlist of all of my microphone talks but we're gonna recommend that you watch just one it's the the beach towels to exit 12 years to overnight success I believe the title is and then I will be answering your questions live on air on a live video stream tomorrow at noon just check out my notes outline here yeah so if you want to be notified about this sign up for micro comm connect comm that's where we do where we will be doing most of the communication the we will send out an email with a schedule but unless you opt in to daily emails you won't get daily emails so feel free to opt in there you can get daily emails or micro Crump connect comm is the place where the questions will be coming so if you want the opportunity to ask questions that's where you're gonna want to be we've had almost 1200 applicants to get in connect we're sending out all the remaining invites today to get people into that group it's a it's a you know always on a slack channel which is great at times like these when we can't be in the same room physically we can be in the same rooms you know virtually so to speak so later this week I'm trying to get dr. sherry walling on just to come on and talk about this this pressure and the anxiety that we're all feeling you know that the world is going through right now I mean it you know it does feel like a crisis and so we want her to come and just talk to us answer questions but also just talk about how to get through this how to take care of yourself mentally and physically and how to how to be present for your family and also get some work done over these next few weeks and then I haven't told him yet but I'm trying to get my taper on for a happy hour this week where he and I hopefully can figure out some whiskies that we share and each do a little you know tasting and kind of talk that through again these are 30 minutes a day at noon Central it's not a huge time commitment I don't expect you to make all of them but if you can make one or two per week my hope is that that we can you know kind of distract you for the time being and and just distract you from the chaos around us but also bring us all together because that's really the point of micro cough right it's the community community trumps it and so if we can't you know get everybody together for the hallway track of micro cough at least we can you know can kind of get together virtually a few times a week and and just keep pushing this ball forward and so we're doing this for the next two three four weeks we don't really know I know that I'm kind of at home with kids for the next three weeks at least I guess we'll take it you know as it comes from there this is definitely an MVP can almost guarantee you some days I will show up with a tank top on I'm just kidding about that but some days I will tell bad jokes as the as the stream is failing some days a kid's gonna walk in behind me and that's just gonna happen and it's real right it's real - its what we're all going through right now so this is very much a Minimum Viable Product but we want to get it out there and we want to we just want to hang out with you all so yeah you'll be you'll be here that was awesome that's the kind of thing that's exactly what I'm talking about I just knocked my own microphone microphone off yeah so again if you want to be in the loop get into micro comm connect follow us on Twitter we will be talking about it there and obviously you can click the link in that email if you want a daily email but frankly I think the other two are probably a lot easier for you to do so thanks again for hanging out and I will see you tomorrow noon central
