[Music] you guys are probably interested in business content I imagine so this cat right here has nothing to do with my presentation but I mean look at how badass that canvas would you not like your business and life to be just about like that because I certainly would yeah so I just I'm actually you know Joanna would never ask you to get up but I would so go ahead get up everyone get up put your hands on your hips just like this do me a favor come on do it it's only gonna take a second all right you got there now just kind of rub elbows the person next to you there you go all right now you can sit back down yeah my view point is that beyond like when I come to these things I think that the real value in life comes from relationships and intimacy and connection with other people and I think that beyond the content that you will get at this event that's probably what you should focus on is try to make one really good relationship now I'm gonna give you a few slides about Who I am so you know you know that I'm you know so I'm just some dude but I'll also tell you some stuff about me I will give you some statistics some high-level overview stuff that is going to frame what I'm gonna talk about and then I'm gonna give you some very tactical Facebook advertising stuff some very tactical email stuff and then I'll end with kind of an overview does that sound good to you no this guy literally shook his head you can leave sir okay so I'll get started now my name is Desiree I'm an e-commerce expert I've been doing this a while in 2016 one of my ecommerce brands check that out bang I think just dropped when my e-commerce transited 17 million in revenue this year we're at five million already and I have several different ecommerce brands and I have an information publishing and software as a service company this is just to show you the 2016 revenue so this is just to show you like I actually know what I'm doing you know I'm kind of a goofball but I really I love this stuff I've got a team of 45 people I've been doing it for 12 years and I'm really really into it also we've sold five million dollars worth of software in the last three years and our current software as a service company is at a hundred and twenty grand a month right now and growing and we've only been at it for 12 months I imagine that it will continue to grow and so what I'm gonna show you is how it was kind of cool was that a little bit of a just give me a little more if you got to have a song that played for you as you walked into a room full of people what would it be this guy oh damn this guy is like full-on just metal right here yeah I thought you'd go with something like we will rock you you know all right I'm gonna give you guys some statistics here we go so I'll give you some stats that'll kind of frame the conversation that we're gonna have I mean this is just a roomful of business athletes right here check you guys out looking good you're a good-looking crowd so touch has taken over so basically the way that people consume the digital medium has fundamentally changed touch base consumption of the Internet has now eclipsed traditional desktop and laptop consumption of the Internet and so it used to be that we had laptops and desktop computers and so when we sat down we spent more time consuming the digital medium in one given period and we didn't do it as much and now that we're carrying these devices around with us all day we're consuming in shorter periods of time but more frequently throughout the day and we end up with more consumption overall like people are in line at the bank they're on the toilet I'm looking at you guy I don't know why but but you know that guy so the way that people consume the Internet has fundamentally changed which changes the way that we need to market our software as a service so I'll give you some stats that'll frame this conversation 33 percent of people who show interest on a mobile advertisement convert on a desktop that's gonna become important later for those of you who are on a budget 33 percent of people which own interest on a mobile ad convert on a desktop 67 percent of consumers start shopping on one device and continue on another how many people here have more than one device basically everyone right two-thirds of your consumers are starting the experience of potentially engaging with your software on one device and finishing it on another people are moving to bigger devices to make purchase decisions and this mobile world that we live in comes with fragmentation the average person has a hundred and ninety four channels that they're consuming from Facebook Instagram Pinterest AOL Google iTunes YouTube there's a hundred and ninety four channels on average that you've consumed content from more than sixty percent in these stats won-soon of adults in America have two devices and a quarter of those people have three anyone in here have more than three devices for more than four more than five one guy Wow that's a lot of technology I'd be curious how you you know what you're doing with all that so one and this will become important to one in five minutes that people spend on mobile devices in the United States are on Facebook and Instagram so those are kind of like the the king and queen of of where people are spending their time and four out of five people in America carry a smartphone with them every day so what does this actually mean for you why are those stats important to you as someone who has a software-as-a-service business that you are trying to engage people with and by the way that last presentation was amazing because at the end of the day I'm gonna give you a bunch of tactics and strategies for selling stuff but like if you're not able to effectively communicate the value that you have to offer and engage someone in a conversation you got nothing like in life it comes down to your ability to communicate in your relationships and your business if you focus on becoming a good communicator you will be a more effective person in your world so the big idea here is that you're going to need multiple touch points with a prospect before you get a conversion it didn't used to be that way or this way it used to be like search find buy search for something they see it they like it take a picture of it buy it it was much easier to sell now with the way that people are consuming the digital medium we need to sort of structure our sales funnels to have multiple touch points I call this multi touch point marketing look at those flames I got my this is my chief platform officer here Dutch danger raise your hand there for playing and he's responsible for those if you would like to shake his hand he made that happen we'll just do it one more time check this out BAM that's danger so the thing that I'm trying to get this is still the overview part what I'm trying to communicate here is that the idea of the single campaign is dead I spend about five million dollars a year on advertising and when I see what I see is that when it comes to advertising people quit far too early they say oh this campaign didn't work and then they shut it down but we have to look at advertising a little differently in today's environment so the frame that I'd like you to take is that your core platform and any sales funnel that you create is simply a collection of conversion assets working in concert with one another to achieve a specific result and I'm actually going to break this down for you and give you sort of actionable usable tidbits here but I'm still giving you the context so basically a prospect to customer journey has three phrases phases you have before during and after or what I like to call awareness retargeting and loyalty as we'll get into in just a moment so the big shift is now understanding that all of your ad campaigns everything that you do to amplify your brand with advertising and all my businesses our ad model businesses I really like businesses that are driven by advertising because it's measurable you can go to the traffic store and buy traffic it's like really a nice way to build a business and anyone in here run ads okay cool well for those of you that's a good like half the room for those of you who don't run ads I'm gonna what I'm about to show you about Facebook will give you the ability to run ads profitably on a small budget and for those of you who are running ads we give you the ability to spend more effectively so the way that we look at advertising is every single campaign and I'm actually going to give you the the touch points here are looked at in three phases awareness retargeting and loyalty awareness is getting your brand or your offer in front of people who don't know about you yet retargeting is Rhian gauging people based on how they've consumed or engaged with your product or your sales funnel and loyalty is like after someone is already a customer like russ was talking about amplifying content or amplifying cross-sell stuff to those people so I'm going to show you kind of how this works but if we know that retargeting and loyalty is where the bulk of your conversions are going to happen we know that people are moving from small devices to big devices to make purchases we know that people need multiple touch points or multiple engagements before they convert these days because they're spending shorter amounts of time on the digital medium so we know that most of our actual trials of people trying our software people buying our software are gonna happen on the second and third touch point so if we know that then that begs the question what's the best top of funnel conversion asset how do we set our sales funnel up so that it's optimized for this sort of new way that people are engaging with the digital medium and the answer is an article simply put a article that engages someone in a conversation about a topic that they are interested in that also alludes to a solution which is your product this is my strategy for business are my businesses in twenty sixteen to twenty two point five million dollars russ was talking about one of them just one article basically every offer that I have has one article that I amplify and I tested I do some other stuff but I'm gonna talk to you about that article and how it needs to look and how specifically should amplify it is this stuff any kind of exciting to you guys okay sweet yeah you guys are you guys are chilling hard this guy this guy this guy just threw the the old hang-loose gesture at me my wife was out of town and when my wife goes out of town my brother like moves in and he have many guest rooms but he moves into the couch I think because it's like bro bro you're that way and I was telling someone about about the bro down I was giving him the lowdown on the bro down and I told them that like had I seen them during that time period I probably would have thrown him a hang-loose gesture just to give you a sense of how bro he it had gotten and in this guy and I think cuz the man bun and beard thing we just have a connection hang loose it's the it's the universal man bun sign bang okay why do you want to amplify content so so the reason you want to amplify content is because new advertising is contextual it used to be that that when I got into the game we only had query based advertising someone would type in a query on Google on Bing or on Yahoo and we'd be able to advertise to them based on what they were searching for and contextual targeting existed but we only had did my mic go we only had one data point we had we knew what website they were on so we knew they were on a website about cats we could advertise them something about cats now we have what's called multi data point contextual targeting we are we were able to have thousands of data points on any given user we know how old they are new we know where they live we know what they're interested in we know what they bought so we can leverage those data points to build a group of people who we think are going to be interested in our stuff and then target them and the reason why we must amplify content today is because when someone wasn't searching for something we need to first engage them in a conversation and add some value to their life before we start being like hey try our stuff are you filming me are you snapchatting me I don't know if that's cool you gotta ask Robin Mike did this guys over here just trying to be sly he's got like us like this pose like he's chilling but he's actually filming okay nobody seems to care about your cool only only me I'm the only guy who cares I don't care man you can feel me so so this is a so the point here is that what we want to do is engage people in a conversation about a topic that they are interested in that then alludes to a solution which is our product so we have to amplify content so step one for an offer is visibility we're gonna get back to this content amplification and how to do it effectively step one is visibility you really have four main places you can buy visibility Facebook Instagram Google you know that's pretty much it here's some other places but mainly this is where you're going to be buying visibility for your brand and I would recommend starting on Facebook and Instagram as software-as-a-service writers you could do LinkedIn to LinkedIn's advertising network Twitter's advertising network are getting a little smarter but they're still kind of clunky and expensive so I would start on Facebook so the first thing that I want to cover is the most common ad mistakes that I see people who are starting advertising making so mistake number one people target too broadly the success of your advertising hinges on your targeting it absolutely wonder if you put the message in front of the wrong person then they're not going to be interested in it like for example you know we have a pretty volatile political climate in our country so if you've got like a Donald Trump supporter and then you put like a Hillary Clinton message in front of them they're not gonna like it or you got a Hillary Clinton or I guess that's previous now the election has happened but during the election had you done that had you targeted the wrong people with messaging it's just not gonna work so how do we start targeting properly initially well the first thing is that you want to start with look-alike audiences so you want to upload your email list you want to upload your buyer list you want to upload you know your Facebook fans your Facebook fans already on their Facebook gives you the ability to create look-alikes based on any engagement so you can you can have a retargeting pixel on your website and I've got free training on my blog that I'll give you at the end of this that teaches you this stuff but you can put a retargeting pics on your website and then all your website visitors build this audience group of people and then you can say give me more people who look like this you can do it for your Facebook fans and if you don't have subscribers fans buyers people visiting your website yet and you can't start with look-alike audiences and by the way what I do is once I have a look-alike audience it's like two million people I then filter it and say only people in this audience who also are fans of Marketo and then I get the people who are most similar to people who visit my website who are also Marketo fans so it's a layer filtered down so if you don't have a any kind of community at this point you can do what's called interest and behavior stacking and this is the most effective type of targeting in the awareness pillar so we're trying to get new people who don't yet know about us the most effective type of targeting and the awareness pillar for your brand is to create groups of people with stacked interests and so what that looks like is I want people who have shown purchase behavior of cosmetics and have purchased fitness products so they must fall into both categories I want people who are fans of Marketo and fans of base camp so they must fit into both categories so this cific style of building an audience will give you the best opportunity of putting your message in front of the people who are most relevant now let's take it a level deeper use the best placements right what you will find is that certain placements do better than other placements so for example I'm gonna give you this tip in a second but I'll just give it to you now we know that people move from smaller to bigger devices to make purchase decisions right like that is a fact that is statistical data right from Facebook I go to Facebook quite a lot because I'm one of their bigger spenders for e-commerce so basically what you can do is you can set up your awareness pillar advertising in front of new people to only run on iPhones to only be running to a stacked audience to only run in the top five states right New York California Pennsylvania Texas Utah Florida New York California Pennsylvania how do you say that Pennsylvania Benson Pennsylvania I got my neighbors from Pennsylvania and he changed the way I say it now New York California Texas Pennsylvania Utah Florida run in those six states that is where you are most likely to make a sale so so now you have only on iPhones in those six states with the stacked behavior and then when you retarget retarget only on desktop and and an iPad so get people's attention on the mobile device but then you know that the second and third touch point they're most likely to buy on a desktop or iPad so don't retarget people on mobile are you with me this is the technical part of it is this too much okay the other thing that you can do is on your mobile awareness ad sets is enable Wi-Fi so only run this ad to people who have Wi-Fi enabled because they're more sedentary they're sitting down with Wi-Fi they're not walking around New York City like me right they're chillin somewhere in a lounge with a beer hanging loose with this dude over here you know I mean so so you can really get specific about who you're targeting and if in the awareness pillar if you're on a budget it makes sense to give yourself the best opportunity to engage with someone who's the most interest most interested so stacked be stacked interests only mobile devices like Omaha for example for us Oh for us iPads are our best placement on every one of our ad sets so if you're really really on a budget you can only run on iPads it'll work pretty well I mean for some reason people who have iPads are like really down they're just like super down to engage your stutter chillin they got this big iPad and they're just like scrolling around you know I don't know what it is but anyone here got an iPad sell to those people go round them up in the back mimic user behavior like I was telling you awareness and acquisition you run your ads on mobile retargeting and loyalty you run your ads on desktop and iPad computer so those are some ads specific stuff I only got 45 minutes I'm trying to give you the best tips at each little pillar to have you have the best chance of success with your advertising mistake number two you want to get a picture you can get my slides at the end of this mistake number two selling the click man I see these ads and they're like super boring right they blend right in they're just like of some random stock image and it's like men if you want to get people's attention in the awareness pillar oh damn there it was again that's danger in the house a pine hiker he was also known as the wooden she'd wonder we got a lot of names for him but he's a good dude so you want flashy attention-grabbing ads which means that you should use lower thirds so every one of your ads should have a headline that's on the actual ad that's like you know these aren't actually on the lower third but you can see what I'm saying a headline that tells the value proposition of that particular ad using cartoons we found to be very effective with getting people to click we also find that ads with people's faces in them also work so here's an example of my software-as-a-service ads start making more money on your Shopify orders person space cartoon and it's a blog post or a case study about how we were able to grow our Shopify average order value have a better sales funnel and it shows the stuff in the back and it's got a lower third on it right so that type this type of ad and we have tested literally hundreds and hundreds of different types of ads this like this little setup with the cartoon and the lower third and the imagery is what is working the best from a conversion standpoint here's another example of that for our soft service businesses your ads must be congruent to your landing page so you can't have like an app person you know people were doing lips a while back everyone's ads had lips and them because lips get clicks for some reason but like you can't have your ad has to be relevant to the content that you're amplifying and here's the interesting thing about the flashy and attention-grabbing ads only in the awareness pillar this isn't in my slide deck once you get to the second touch point and beyond all the advertising becomes brand oriented because now you want to start building relationship talking about you know having brand ethos communicating brand values displaying your logo in colors and stuff so just to get people's attention you get a little buck wild you're in Vegas you know I mean that's why you started at 10:00 a.m. because people weren't showing up at 9:00 a.m. I assume you know I mean maybe not nobody does know what I mean all right keep it going no response to that one so here we go mistake number three post click engagement and post engagement selling this is a kind of what Joanna was talking about you need to engage your prospects in a conversation about topics that they are actually interested in problems that are relevant to them anyone in here a super sweater is that what it was called super sweater you want to MIT to okay I actually I'm gonna from a super sweater but I definitely always have the armpit stains and somehow Facebook knows this you know that because I speak on stage a lot and and I do a lot of presentation I get the I sweat through the shirts and apparently there's like a some these strap on pads you can get and I was like nah I'm not doing that I'm not going strap on with the pads but anyone who's in that spot you don't have to admit it you know I mean but if you're sweating through your shirt they got pads for that okay so you need to engage them your prospects in a conversation you need to get them to say yes to consuming your sales message they've got to read that headline and actually be interested and it starts with one core front and acquisition funnel every business literally just needs one funnel that works and I'm going to give you the one that we use and I'm going to show you examples across multiple offerings this is our funnel we call it the dipsy-doodle and the Don deliver can say that doodle now you got to go doodle there it is this guy in the front row who was who has felt he's got a crazy mic dude are you filming me on a camera too sure hold that pulled that big camera up show him what you're doing alright he's been out it this guy so this is our sales funnel basically we go from our traffic sources to a pre sell engagement article to our offer page to our checkout sequence that's essentially what it is I'm going to break this down for you showing you a software-as-a-service example with a webinar and then a software-as-a-service example without a webinar and then another software-as-a-service is a example I can't even say it but I'm going to show you that stuff okay so we don't chase our prospects we don't come out and say buy our stuff that's how it used to be when someone was searching for a product back where I came from I came from the days of search engine optimization of Google Adwords you know I was in the game back in 2005 using AdWords as my traffic source and back then it was like yeah you can sell something directly from when someone searches for it cuz you know what they were looking for now we let them chase us we amplify a piece of content that is designed to engage them in a conversation that then alludes to a solution which is our product they click through from the article to the solution because they're interested so they're chasing the offer rather than us chasing them with the offer does that make sense we have re we've reframed it to use NLP terminology we've made it so that they're now chasing us because we added value to their lives through a piece of content that we knew they would be interested in because it was related to a problem that they are facing that our product solves here's an example of what it looks like for our e-commerce business now to go one level sort of higher for you and this isn't what this presentation really isn't about Facebook advertising it's about it's about software as a service using content but we use video ads sometimes on Facebook because the beauty of a native video is people can consume it on Facebook and then you can do audiences of people who consume 25% 50% 75% and didn't click through and then you can run ads to those people so what the point that I want to communicate to you is that what you are doing is you're tracking funnel engagement so they click the ad they made it to the article they didn't click to the sales page okay you need to re-advertise another piece of content to them or the same piece of content because they didn't consume it the first time so you're tracking how they engage with your sales funnel and you're communicating with them based on what they've done and when we get into the email segmentation part of this it's gonna make a lot more sense because people under people are willing to adopt this technology within email it makes more sense but what I want you to do is think of think of your brand as a group of people and multiple communication mediums the group of people is whoever you have gotten to be interested and the communication mediums are email advertising facebook Messenger mobile push notifications there's a whole bunch of other channels but the main channels that you're gonna focus on as a new business owner are gonna be ads and emails so everything you're doing an email you should be doing in ads it's just another communication channel now this pre-sell engagement article here by the way they gave me a laser pointer would you look at that that was not smart because I could just play with this thing you know I mean anyone ever get one remember when these things first came out in high school and like people had them and you didn't yet know that you weren't supposed to shine them in people's faces that definitely happened to me yeah I've then found that out but all right well let's stop playing with a laser pointer although this guy's gonna get a laser pointer on his Jesse's filming me here freecell needs to relate to the problem that your product solves the pre-sale engagement article must know somebody there you go relate to you guys come on man give me something here relate to the problem that your product solves if if it doesn't it's not going to work right so this article that you're amplifying can like every product solves a problem right every software as a service is designed to solve a problem so the best kinds of pre-cell and engagement articles to amplify for software-as-a-service brands are case studies they work really really well everyone's familiar with case study marketing like it's software-as-a-service 101 you know white papers remember those things you guys remember those right who's been in the game while I remember white paper marketing was real big couple years ago this is just white paper marketing basically we did not invent anything here so behavioral automated response responding to people based on the behavior that they have taken I'm now going to frame this for you same concept same thing but I'm gonna frame it for you through the communication medium of emails okay this is a software-as-a-service product we had for Amazon business owners it was six hundred bucks every every three months or something like that it was pretty expensive and for us for our more expensive software as a service we go for a longer form sales messaging because we need more time to hold someone in a sales cycle before they're willing to say yes the more expensive your product is the longer the sales cycle will be right I used to sell hundred thousand dollar lots of land in Uruguay which was a whole wild experience but the sales cycle was a year from the point we generated a lead to the point we made a sale now the sales cycle with like you know fit I sell also courses and stuff on how to do Facebook ads and things like that I have an information publishing company most of our tickets they're like 1500 bucks so that sales cycles usually a couple months before someone's willing to pay us 1500 hours for a training program for my software as-a-service that's like 37 dollars a month I don't need a really long sales cycle as I'm going to show you this particular software as-a-service did need a long sales cycle because it was like 600 bucks every quarter so this is what that looks like I'm gonna break it down for you so the first thing is we have an advertisement that goes to a pre sell engagement article right that's the first step is where am plying to everyone's filming up in here we're amplifying the content we're amplifying a pre sell engagement article this is what that pre sell article looked like it was like hey here's how we boosted our Amazon sales and here's how you can do the same basically right it was a case study about how to grow your Amazon brand because the software was about how to grow an Amazon brand and it was pretty long it broke down this whole sales funnel you know and then at the end of it at the end of it it was like hey if you liked this and you'd like even more training about how to grow your Amazon business often for our webinar right so it was an article that then led to a webinar opt-in again because it was high ticket it's the didn't opt in we run ads to them that lead them directly to the long-form content so we have advertising that retarget them if they do opt in we then try to get them to consume the webinar so we have three emails that go out that are designed to say hey move to the next step of the sequence you know your webinar is happening hey the webinar is going away hey here's a PDF of the webinar because multiple different people prefer to consume content in different formats every landing page Joanna was saying sometimes she doesn't put you know imagery and stuff I am a fan of using every available media format because I find that some people will watch the webinar and some people will read the PDF some people will look at the imagery and some people will look at the text and so I like to have every available media format on my landing pages and so when we started sending out the PDF of the webinar we SAR 12% boost in sales because people who would not watch the video and I think this might be to her point would read the article right so transcribe your video content into PDFs make it readable and send that to people so we have our get them to consume campaign as soon as they click to the webinar and they've consumed part of the webinar by the way this is what the webinar looks like it's just a real simple page hey here it is hey check out our software right because the call to action is to get them to check out our software so as soon as they consume the webinar we then have an engagement campaign we want them to visit the sales page right so they made it to the webinar page so we've gotten them effectively with our onboarding email sequence after they opted in from the presale article to visit the webinar now we want them to view the sales page but what if they don't click through what if they go to the webinar page and they don't actually click through to the sales page well what we're doing is we're retargeting them via email with behavioral response content based on how much of the webinar they consumed Wistia does this with every CRM it will pass the data of how much of the video they watched into your CRM you can have that trigger in automation to communicate with them based on what they consumed or didn't consume so what we have is emails for 25% of the webinars 50% of the webinar 90% of the webinar here's what you missed you know and I mean we're with so first one first one goes out Slyke some Rises what they saw and what they didn't see directs them back to the webinar to consume more right that's email number one then we continue are you is this like too much for you guys know you're digging it okay we continue to engage with them by following up with relevant content and unless they buy from us so the next thing that goes out is a webinar PDF hey we hope this helps please watch this PDF of the webinar this is another day has passed they didn't click through to the sales page yet as soon as they click through the sales page we're gonna change what we're doing but until we get them to see the actual sales message we're still following up with content then we say hey this PDF is going away it's your last chance to get it so we want to communicate urgency deadlines are huge in emailing and ads so we communicate hey come back and consume more content before you lose the opportunity to do so then we start going into content that's specific to the product and the the product that we have for sale so it's like hey we have some ads training in here for how to grow your Amazon business with ads come back and watch it hey here's an FAQ of what our product you know what our product is about so we kind of try to make a last-ditch effort to try to sell them the product now then what we do is if anyone who's consumed 90 percent or more of the webinar we straight start pitching they've consumed ninety percent which means they've seen a pitch for the product they maybe have never made it to the sales page but they've seen a pitch so we say hey you should buy our stuff and then finally we say hey maybe do you want a trial of our stuff like you seem interested you've stayed on a webinar for at least 90 minutes why don't you try all the product and then we say hey it's your last chance for a trial you should take advantage of it as soon as they visit the sales page by the way these are still people who never visited the sales page we start them on a whole new sequence of behavioral emails the point here is whatever the communication medium what you must be doing is tracking funnel engagement and communicating based on consumption this will revolutionize your business it will change the ROI will give you the ability to actually advertise effectively is that like cool yeah okay I think so I mean I'm into this kind of stuff so so basically then once they actually visit the sales page we then have a long-form sales page video and long-form coppy about what the product will do for you it's a little bit longer enough I didn't want to show the whole thing because it's pretty long so you know we pay special attention to our most engaged prospects right and of course if someone adds the product to the car and doesn't buy you should be retargeting them with ads so you're doing and advertising everything that you're doing in email but anyone in here have a sales funnel for their offering that's that long form and that dynamic based on segmentation probably like a couple right so there's always room for improvement and you frankly oh it to yourself to do good marketing like if you actually believe that you have the best solution in your marketplace and if you don't believe that then you shouldn't do any other stuff you know I mean you should just go home like you got you go home and work on the product because you know product you got to have a good product but I'm assuming that if you're here you've got a good product so if you market effectively you then have more revenue to invest in creating a better product to invest in having better support to invest in doing better marketing so like the better you market the better you serve your customers is how it ends up working so we also retargeted every step we retarget people who visit the pre-sale page but not the webinar we retarget people who visit the webinar but not the sales page we retarget people who visit the sales page and not the cart where we target people who visit the cart and not the buyers and all of our ads mimic these emails and then once someone buys we're amplifying onboarding and consumption content or amplifying cross-sell content for different offerings that we have so the sales process does not end with the purchase the sales process begins at the purchase we want to be talking about lifetime customer value average order value cross selling right like you got to have multiple offerings you got to be upselling two yearly packages and stuff like that here's an example of a thirty seven dollar product it's literally just a pre-sale engagement article right - a long-form sales page super simple super basic low dollar product doesn't need a whole lot other than a nice article on a nice sales page you can pair this sales funnel down and you and when you look at the slides you'll be able to kind of break it down a little bit you can pair this sales funnel down if you're you know product is lower dollar here's an example of a video ad that leads it's like a seven minute video ad that leads to a webinar opt-in page for our facebook video ads training that then leads to actually this one's for simplified pages for our Shopify landing page builder so the key here is that every offer that you have needs to have multiple conversion assets pre-sale engagement article long-form sales page customer reviews short form content long-form content video content reviews and video format in text format email automations pre-sale pages like your business is a collection of conversion assets that work in concert with one another across multiple communication channels therefore step one is create the conversion assets get a webinar get a long-form sales page get your cousin to give you a review if you don't got anyone else you know it mean get you get mine right here come up to Dutch danger and be like man I need a review and he's charming and he'll give it to you so you got to have multiple conversion assets first then you need to leverage those conversion assets through multiple communication mediums to intake a prospect from awareness to retargeting to loyalty and there will be very few people who will see your ad consume your stuff and buy it most people are going to have four or five six touch points before they actually make a purchase and so you need to be deliberate about what those touch points are and that's the main sort of ethos of what I want you to get out of this presentation I don't really care what your sales funnel looks like as long as you understand that what we're doing now is we're looking at our advertising as the aggregate cost per acquisition from awareness retargeting and loyalty that gives you the ability to scale because now you can say after three months when I generate a click and I have all these different ad sets running and I've got a loyalty campaign that's cross selling people who bought once now you have the opportunity does that make sense like it gives you more freedom because you're no longer just trying to make the first engagement work another thing that I want you to remember is that repetition creates mastery this feels that you want to acquire as a human being is the skillset of mastery which is simply the willingness to put your attention in one area consistently over time you pick up the instrument for 30 minutes a day you're going to get better at it direct response advertise behavioural automated response email marketing it's just another skill set I'm pretty good at it because I've been doing it a while put 30 minutes a day into getting better at advertising and you will get better at it and the other thing is it's not about how much you work it's about what you produce the number ones I get the opportunity to engage with thousands and thousands of entrepreneurs on a yearly basis we've got over a hundred thousand folks in our community of e-commerce business owners and the number one thing I see is that people burn out they're just like constantly cranking on their business they never have time for their hobbies for their passions for their relationships and it's like work will fill the amount of time you give it so set hard boundaries and you'll actually end up being more productive and more effective you don't actually need 14 hours in a day you know seven eight that's plenty and then go out and have a good time spend some time with your friends be you know have some kind of hobby hang loose with somebody you know it's really not about how much you work and and you actually owe it to yourself to have it be a marathon because you don't want to burn out if you burn out then you're a wreck if you've if you've worked to the point where you're a stress ball and then you're you're not very nice to anyone nobody wants to hang out with you your body's a wreck it's like well what are you doing what is the point of all this in the first place so you only give from your own surplus so you've got to create surplus so that you can be available and for the people in your life right so take care of yourself is my point you can get my slides at smartmarketer.com for slash micro conf conf you can email me as rhett smartmarketer.com my business smartmarketer.com our tag lines serve the world unselfishly and profit I got like six minutes if you got questions thank you very much thanks so much for that Ezra just want to say I've been following your work for several years and your make sense dude look at your hair [Laughter] you you do really well you do really well at making people feel like they know you like I've seen you on video I feel like I know you even though it's like the first time seeing you in person yeah just want to see if you could speak to live webinar versus recorded webinar obviously with a recorded one you know things like Plus this integrating Wistia with Infusionsoft being able to tell how far people have yeah through well sure I think you should really whoa you should have both you should have all I mean live webinars work really well because people know that you're live but obviously you can't be live all the time you know so I think that like what we try to do is we try to run one live webinar a month it's a lot to put on a live event you know and then obviously we've got pre-recorded webinars that are in our ongoing evergreen automated sales funnels but what happens is you end up generating a lot of leads who fall out of the automated sales funnel who then show up to a live webinar and actually buy from the live webinars some people will watch webinars a couple of times before they buy the other thing I'll say about presenting is that everyone is so focused on their performance they've got so much attention on themselves that they then are a mess like everywhere you go in society you're running into messaging about how you're flawed you're too fat you're not the right color you don't smell right like everyone is selling you about how wrong you are so everyone's running around with like playing defense and super worried about how they're performing in relationship to any given subject and then aren't therefore not available to actually play so the more you can get out of paying attention to your own performance and the more you can just be present and have fun the better your presentations will be I don't know if that was your question but so how do you know if so you talked about running emails and ads at the same time yeah so specifically how do you know if your ad is cannibalizing a sale you are going to get for free from an email and sort of more generally can you talk about attribution models yeah so multi-touch point attribution is it it's tough man it's like there's there's tools out there segment com 1000 attribution app there's a bunch of them and I think that basically unless you are engaging with the third-party service provider for attribution then you are probably going to be at 80% between like Google Analytics and Facebook and Infusionsoft or whatever you're using stripe like you're going to end up not having true attribution but my point is that it doesn't matter who cares where the sale came from some people are gonna buy from ads some people are gonna buy from emails I want to be visible on all channels and I've got a certain ad budget and I'm gonna spend it because if I don't I'm gonna end up with a smaller business than if I did and yeah you could get real crazy about attribution and we actually do but it's relevant to the technology stack so it's not actually an applicable conversation for a room of 2 to 150 people because it's about your particular technology stack whatever attribution you know software that you engage with but my point would be set all this stuff up and don't worry about it and then once you've got data coming in start to worry about attribution yeah what's up dude what's your name Jeremy how's it going great talk by the way um a lot of people talking about the specificity in the ads and trying to get specific to the person the prospect so how are you running like dozen different campaigns to try and target all these different people yeah that's budget specific right so I would recommend starting with look-alikes of who your most common that website visitors or Facebook fans or buyers are and stacking that with a particular interest people who look like these people and are also interested in Marketo yes we are obviously always testing different groups of people to target but basically I would say you need to spend 50 dollars a day for three days on one group of people before you know whether or not they're relevant I think 150 bucks on one specific group before you can actually tell over the course of a couple days whether or not that group is going to be you know interested and if you go to a where's my slide back can you put my slide back up here my closing slide no okay can't do it anyways I've got a I don't know maybe it wasn't cool to offer slides I'm I did not know that I apologize anyways so never mind you don't go to my blog any other questions oh hi user great a really great talk Thanks you talked about the the big four and and your examples from Facebook where there's a lot of data and ability to target an audience yeah how much or if any experience or thoughts on using you know placing your ads in a more domain-specific podcast or other places where they might not have that sort of data yeah but your audience is better targeted totally I think podcasting is a really awesome channel of advertising for software service providers i sponsor podcasts for my software it's not sort of easy to necessarily track that it's not easy there's no easy way to go to the podcast store and buy those ads so I was just given examples of where I thought people could start but one of the things that I will say is that Google is actually has more capacity and more ad space than Facebook when you look at Google AdWords Google Display Network YouTube Google Shopping and what I would do is I would start with running all your awareness ads on Facebook right so all your new awareness where you're getting new people into the funnel run that on Facebook and Instagram those are like the same platform then when your retargeting people in that second and third touch point do that across channels retarget them on rate YouTube retarget them on Google Display Network retarget them on Google AdWords so leverage these other channels beyond the first touch point after you've generated that awareness if that makes sense yeah it's really effective cross channel remarketing all right dude right here what's up dude man hey man dude here on the promoted article you said that you were gonna go into some of the key points of it yeah so how does when you get people there what's the call to action from it um so basically like I think that article should be between 500 and 1000 words it should be very I actually had a slide I don't know where it went but I thought there was a slide in there that broke down how we write those articles but basically though in the article you're talking about this problem that a user is facing that your solution you know happens to provide and I like to do case studies because then I can be like and these people had this experience and they use this thing and and then this other thing happened oh and they use this tool and I keep just referencing back to the thing that provided this result that the case study is about that you can then click through to then end up on the sales page or end up on a webinar about so it's always sort of framed that the good thing that happened that we're talking about in this article the solution to the problem that this person was facing that this article was talking about was caused by X and we're referencing it after we've put some content out there I think I'm out of time guys thank you very much thank you
