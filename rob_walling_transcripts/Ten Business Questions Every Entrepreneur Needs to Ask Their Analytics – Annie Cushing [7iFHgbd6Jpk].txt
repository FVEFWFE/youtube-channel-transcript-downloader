================================================================================

[Music] all right so today I'm going to talk about 10 questions entrepreneurs need to ask their analytics a little bit about me I if you've ever seen my blog I blog at analytics comm because in my name is Annie and I do analytics it was kismet actually started as a joke on Twitter and became a brand so all things are possible so if anyone has been to my blog I have a compulsion to create good especially Google Docs any kind of resources that will help especially marketers but I also have quite a bit for developers the one that's probably been populated the most is my hundreds of tools for marketers doc it literally contains hundreds of tools and it takes the approach a lot of tools lists just list the tools I started with what is it that you actually need to get done you know and what's the task they're broken up into different spreadsheets by categories and then I let you know if it's you know free or paid or paid with an upgrade option and I don't classify something as paid with an upgrade option unless you get quite a bit free and then I also have an audit checklist that is again massive and if you want to do a do-it-yourself audit you can use these one thing I'll mention I I do have all of the bit ly links in the presentation don't actually use all caps that's just a style thing you actually want to use a lower case but when I say compulsion it is a compulsion it's like my Catcher in the Rye I think the government implanted it in me or Google or someone but but throughout my site you'll see all kinds of Google Docs and and but it's kind of funny being at this comp like I had never heard of micro calm until Rob graciously invited me to speak and I've been so engaged the entire time listening to you guys talk I'm like I don't even know why I was invited to speak here because like I don't monetize anything I mean except for like my training and consulting I'm like the pollyana of marketing I'm like here you go here's the farm you know just anything to help people you know kind of learn what I feel like they need to learn so so don't take any kind of like business advice for me just analytics hmm all right so talking about analytics things can get really technical really fast and I'm going to avoid that in this talk and really strictly focus on the business so all of these questions are going to be questions that as business owners as entrepreneurs you should be asking your analytics and a lot of times people just don't know that they can ask their analytics these questions so I'm going to jump right in they're not in any particular order with the exception of the first one this first one if you want to check email just wait until we get past number one then you could go back to checking email Twitter or Facebook but this I would say is by far the most important one which is which marketing channels are your unsung heroes and there are quite a few but first I have to kind of back up I do have to get a little bit geeky but I'll keep it to a minimum so first I need to explain last click attribution it's just geek speek and here's a simple explanation so let's say someone comes to your site via your social media channel maybe your twitter you share a link or facebook and and then let's say within an 80 day period they come back via organic so they're searching for something they find your site they click through a couple weeks later let's say they signed up for your email they come back to your site from a link in your email and if you how many people here do email marketing okay well I have a resource that I'm going to get to in a minute that you absolutely have to check out but then then let's say they come back and on the last visit they buy something for $100 and this is the result of clicking on your ad what last click attribution does is it says okay all the credit goes to CPC so it doesn't matter that your social media channel was your brand evangelists that you rocked it on organic or that your email is effective all the credit goes to CPC no one should be using last click attribution in 2014 2008 - all we had not 2014 so now let's talk about multi-channel funnels where you caught multi click attribution so Google last year came up with these multi-channel funnels there are some issues I'll touch on those but basically what it does is it says ok if that conversion was worth $100 it gives each one of those channels that assisted within that with they caught a look back window equal amounts of credit so social gets $25 organic email of CPC this is a great way to see which of your channels are actually performing that you don't know they're performing so I recently I was talking with someone about Twitter and I was trying to explain just the travesty of last click attribution and why we shouldn't be relying on it as much as we do and I said you know I'll be kind of like if you owned a football team and you said ok guys here's the deal whoever scores a touchdown you guys get paid everyone else sucks to suck I mean that's really what last-click attribution does and but multi-channel funnels kind of takes more on the team approach everyone who helps get the ball downfield and that's about as much as I know about football and I like the Eagles and I like green but but that's it but anyway so multi-channel funnels kind of gives the credit to everyone who assists so you know but if you think about it like life just doesn't lend itself to last click attribution in so let's take the example of the Duggar family I love to pick on these guys they're just so cute but let's say that Jim Bob decides after baby number in nineteen that's it I quit I'm gonna get the operation I'm gonna be shooting blanks I mean would it be fair to put the blame of that on cute little they think her name is Josie no I mean in reality all 19 of them contributed to that final decision yeah I've done enough damage to society you know so anyway so that's just kind of like you know leave Josie alone but so but if you really think about it like nothing operate well I shouldn't say nothing I really try to avoid okay I've gotta stop she's distracting uh but nothing really you know like it just doesn't make sense um so here's where you can actually find it it's the assisted conversions report if you go down to I can't see it here I think it says they they just changed all of the names but conversions and then assisted conversions multi-channel funnels assisted conversions that's where you're gonna find these and one other little caveat this is so weird it took me the longest time to figure out what the hell they were talking about but see here where it says last click or direct conversion value I was like what's that it's just last click the reason they said that they put it that way is I think they were thinking well technically if it's direct someone's not actually clicking on something so we're gonna get like super pedantic and include both but just think of it as here's your revenue from last click here's your revenue from assisted conversions and if we look at this a little low actually before we get into that there are a couple things that I recommend changing changing or adjusting the first is in the upper left hand corner how many people here have revenue tracking or at ecommerce tracking set up on your site yeah okay so if you ecommerce tracking I recommend making this change and deselecting goals because if you have goal values assigned I just don't like to muddy the water with because it will by default include both and I really just like to focus on e-commerce if you are tracking goals the only way you can use multi-channel funnels is you have to have some kind of revenue so you need to assign values to your goals okay the other thing here is there's this it's called a look-back window it's in the upper right hand corner by default Google sets it to 30 days is because they don't want you to use up all their resources I recommend that you click that slider and push it all the way to 90 because then it's gonna look at the last 90 days to see you know which channels have been driving traffic to your site instead of the last 30 how many people here use the Google Analytics API oh okay awesome unfortunately the API doesn't have this slider incorporated I actually worked pretty closely with the Google Analytics team and I asked them about it and they were like oh we're looking into that which off-the-record don't tweet this but it really means oh we forgot to include that so if you're using the API you are limited to 30 days and that's important because your numbers won't match up if you're using if you're going back and forth between the interface and the API so it's word to the wise on that one so but if we just look at one of the line items here I just picked a random client and if you look at the last click revenue as $14,000 if you look at the assisted revenue it's over $82,000 that's a five hundred and seventy seven percent uptick in revenue that most marketers and site owners aren't even taking into consideration and so I just randomly picked a client looked at the last month and charted it out and you can see organic isn't even the most the most I don't know whatever her like you have social networks up here with a twenty three hundred percent uptick and and that's pretty much the norm social revenue is almost always going to underreport with last clique so I'm just going to mention this in passing there are some changes that you kind of have to make to clean things up if you are using campaign tags it is a prime importance that you set it up correctly because the way that you tagged especially social the most important thing I'll tell you is you have to set UTM underscore medium to social do not set medium to Twitter or Facebook you will under report everything not just in your multi-channel funnels but there's another channels report so and that's all covered in the the link here the GA campaign tagging guide this is an absolutely ginormous guide that covers all things campaign tagging I even included a video and my training style is basic like take you by the hand like oh it's only scary the first time and I explain everything and of course I have a Google Doc where if you just put in your campaign parameters it uses a formula to automatically generate the URLs and I even include like an example campaign with different mediums and stuff so feel free to check that out but there is one section fixing your default channel grouping section and that's where you'll learn more about how you can fix your channel groupings if those are messed up now another thing that's that's really important to understand is that multi-channel funnels are not the same thing as the standard funnels and so you can see the standard funnels up here under acquisition multi-channel funnels are down in conversions and there's actually I really take umbrage at the fact that they put multi-channel funnels inside of conversions because from an information architecture standpoint it looks like it's kind of a subset of conversions but it's not multi-channel funnels uses a completely different API and and logic so what happened was in the early days this probably dates back to this probably isn't Google's fault well Google's good for it yeah whatever the big boys but when they set up the attribution system they they kind of set up this good-old-boy system where they said you know what all right here's the deal if direct is the loss let's say a channel or a lack of channel that someone visits your site with and converts whatever channel they came to your site before a direct inherits the credit so if they came to your site via let's say organic and then they came back via direct in all of the last click attribution reports which is everything except that tiny little section of multi-channel Klaus direct doesn't get credit the other channel does and Google had no idea or urge and they had no idea that this would end up biting them in the butt in a major way because what was happening was directs like okay fine it was like the redheaded kid you know it's like getting pushed up against the lockers alright here you go here's your credit you know and but now with the multi-channel funnels Direct gets credit if they're the loss if someone comes to your site within that 90-day look back window via direct and convert direct actually gets the credit so if you compare the data in your multi-channel funnels report with your other reports they're not going to match up well in the multi-channel funnels direct is typically going to get credit for a lot more revenue and this is really unfortunate and it's the main reason that they can't incorporate multi-channel funnels throughout all of Google Analytics it's just like its own little ecosystem but in my opinion it shouldn't be nestled in the e-commerce reports because it is its own ecosystem and I think that there's a general assumption that this is just part of the e-commerce tracking but it's so that's all I'll say about that moving on where do your best links come from so link building is pretty important in SEO and it's important to know where your best links are coming from and every time I check one I'm really surprised like there are times and I even track tracked like social mentions and stuff and I'll still find links in in this report that I had no idea about now the one caveat is there's no standard report for this so we're gonna have to use a custom report I do use quite a few custom reports any custom report I do I share with you you know so I'll provide the URLs at the very end I'll give you the bitly link for the SlideShare so don't feel like you have to furiously type down all these URLs but so here's where you find the standard reports everything in that left sidebar but one caution with that is most people think that's Google Analytics like all of those reports and when I was new to Google Analytics sometimes I'd want to research something and I'd go into our report and I'd click on something or drill down I'd be like crap I wanted landing pages with this you know you drill down from medium and I get source and you just kind of kick the dirt and move on those are think of the standard reports it's basically just like templates but you should really be relying much more on custom reports so we're going to need to use a custom report for this and I'm using a dimension called the full reverb this is kind of a newer dimension as far as I know Google Analytics never announced it at least I didn't get a notification for an announcement but it's really awesome because before I just happened to stumble across this to get the full URL I would have to concatenate source plus referral path and anytime you see path in analytics it's just Geek Speak for URI you know just the the part of the URL after the domain but so they created this new dimension called the full refer and you can apply that here's here are a few network's sites that don't include the full URL I think one of the most unfortunate ones is YouTube all the referrals from YouTube just show up as /watch so you can't see your specific YouTube videos if you want to know your specific view Tube videos I recommend tagging those links and putting it in the the description but here's the underbelly of the report this is how you pull together a custom report I'll share a video that I did that explains how to use custom reports these are all of your metrics metrics are basically anything that can be measured with a number these are your this is the dimension the full refer and I applied a referral a filter that just says the medium has to equal referral pretty simple now if you're new to Google Analytics it can be pretty difficult to keep track of like all the different like dimensions and metrics and stuff so Google provided this resource that is absolutely phenomenal especially if you click a web or is it yeah over here web so even if you're learning how to use the API I highly recommend clicking web because what it does is it tells you the the web view name and the API name because a lot of times they're very very different but that's that's a great great resource just to find out like well what kinds of dimensions and metrics are there to choose from and here's where you can find the the video that I did it is one of my earlier videos so you have to start somewhere and there's nothing I can do about my twelve-year-old voice in these videos it's really bad okay so the third one is what a visitors search for when they come to your site so basically this is just your site search you should always have site search well not always but just about and and this is basically like your visitors wish list so when I worked in house for a publishing company once I was just going through their Site Search report and I saw that like all of these visitors wanted to know more about HDR photography but they taught like really highbrow digital photography and stuff so they they weren't keen all on using on providing training for HDR but then when I showed them how many people were searching the site and then saying wow I guess you don't offer it and moving on and then I showed them the keyword research you know to show how many people were searching google and and then within six weeks they had a program that but because they did like online training and stuff and within six months that one particular course had made them more than sixty thousand dollars so there is gold in these hills and just to let you know the studies have shown that more sophisticated visitors tend to use Site Search less sophisticated visitors tend to browse as a general rule so here's what the site search terms report looks like here's where to navigate to it I won't i won't duplicate this you can you know check out all this but here's where you can see the terms that people are searching when they come to your site and I'll just I'll just show you one example of a bunch of people who are searching for hundreds of tools because of that tools talk and you can see here the time spent after search is just under 13 minutes and the page depth is four pages so I can look at that and see wow you know like people really hang around after searching for hundreds of tools because they're like holy crap is this even for real but um but anyway so it's a great great report to use if you want to know how to set it up is simply do a search on your site you can't you can't use an ajax search like your search actually has to return a URL and you'll see on my cert on my site when i search for a test the query parameter up in the URL if f sometimes it's it's search sometimes it's keyword look for that query parameter and then go to admin view which used to be profile whatever reason they change profiles of you and then view settings and then scroll down to site search settings and just drop that query parameter in I also recommend stripping the query parameters out of the URLs if you don't you're gonna get it's just going to create a bunch of noise and duplication in your content reports all right next question how many pages does it take to convert so in Google Analytics you can pretty easily find out how many days it takes someone to convert and how many visits it takes someone to convert and that's all under conversions days to purchase but or time to purchase but it's not there's not a standard way to find out how many pages does someone have to you know drill through my site to ultimately convert and I use this to basically this is my assessment of how if you combine it with a low conversion rate it will let me know okay this isn't an organic traffic issue this isn't your you're getting foot traffic to your site you just can't convert them so you suck it CRO but for this report we have to get a little fancy so again you can reference the slides but we're going to need to use an advanced segment in almost all of the reports in Google Analytics whether it's a custom report or a standard report you'll see this all down facing arrow you just click on that and then I choose built in built in up here and then visits with transactions and I specifically want to target which visits actually included transactions okay and then what I do is I close all of all visits so I'm just looking at all right I just want to see the traffic from people who came to my site and actually ended up converting it's very insightful so here was one client you could see that for that particular month there were low over seven thousand page views and a little more than one thousand visits so that's about seven and a half it took to convert so okay yeah I would give that a thumbs up seven half pages that includes like getting through your sales funnel that's pretty good I have another client well as a former client but they still have I still have access to their analytics because people forget to turn that off sorry but but they they had a question about why they weren't converting better so I used this in fact it was this client this is where I came up with this idea of looking for pages to convert you look here and you see one in twenty one thousand page views and out of 595 visits that's an average of 37 freaking pages to convert when I brought this to them I was like dice picture a gauntlet that is what your visitors have to endure to get to a conversion and you know is really high I wasn't actually quite I wasn't harsh I was like guys this is really bad and they were like no no no we think that people are just really engaged in our site and I said well you know what if you had like a two and a half percent conversion rate even I'd say maybe you have a point zero to conversion rate which suggests this isn't just like and they sell like designer handbags this isn't just a bunch of chicks looking at a bunch of bags this is people going I have no idea how did like get through this site if you're into Juarez Mexico that's what I told them I was like you walked through the streets of waters you have people like screaming at you to buy their wares and stuff and that's what their conversion cycle was like and and the funny thing is I told them that last year this was the last month's data so clearly they didn't take that to heart so so anyway um okay another question should you consider going responsive so responsive is all the rage it's where you know you just have one page you serve up the same page for different devices it's a very legitimate question here here's an example of how you can use your analytics to help you make that decision we're going to use again a custom report and one of the dimensions we're going to use is one of my favorite dimensions Google Analytics really did I don't think they even announced this and I think the dimension is awesome it's called the device category and dimension and before device category they just had a boolean dimension is mobile so they just said either the visitor was on a mobile device or they were on desktop that was it but studies have shown that visitors on mobile devices behave very different from differently from visitors on tablets so then they came up with this device category dimension which breaks it down into mobile devices tablets and desktop which is sublime and then what I did was I wanted to be able to click on let's say mobile and look at the specific landing pages that's obviously the page has someone lands on and you can see here that for this particular client when you look at mobile their bounce rate is quite a bit higher than the others so that end not much revenue coming from mobile now there are other factors to consider but you know this is a good starting place now if we drill down I didn't want to show my clients landing pages so I decided to use my own and this was really really really bad so I picked two of my more popular pages and and then I also decided to throw an average page load time that's a really good dimension or a metric to look at and you can see here the bounce rates are pretty high now bounce rates for a blog are kind of not a very accurate measure because someone could spend 20 minutes on your page if they don't click through to another page then it's going to register as a bounce but you can add like an event either a time triggered event or a scroll event that will make bounce rate infinitely more accurate but average page loading time and yeah that's that's on me and uh yeah I suck but um but anyway but you can sorry but you can use that report to kind of get a sense for if you should consider going responsive next one are you tagging all of your emails so all Alaska client this you know are you tagging all your emails I'll typically say yes yes we are you know but again this requires a little bit of background there are three reasons you absolutely have to tag your the links that point back to your site not links a point that to other people's sites is like painting your neighbor's house just links that point back to your site it's absolutely critical the first reason is desktop apps do not pass referred data like if people are using out like Outlook or webmail no referral data gets passed and it's because they're headless files and you guys probably know more about this than I do but they will show up in your analytics as direct another reason secure webmail providers don't pass refer data so like if we look at Yahoo you can see this isn't a secure page it's an HTTP 9 HTTPS you don't see the little lock so because of that if you click on a link from a yahoo email and then it's gonna pass referral data and that's actually going to show up in your analytics but it's gonna show up in your referral report and you can confirm this with a bookmarklet I do provide a list of all the links in a bitly bundle to at the end of the presentation secure email is a different story so email providers like Gmail and Hotmail they switch to a secure server and so if you see that HTTPS or the the little lock icon that's secure and no data passes so when I use the bookmarklet to see what the referral is it just shows up as blank and that's where you can get the little bookmarklet if you want it third reason as if those aren't compelling enough Mobile doesn't pass very much and I would say most data because most apps aren't passing any kind of refer data it's usually only if they're like in Safari or something like that and even that can be sketchy so those in the end what happens is most of your email traffic if you're not tagging will show up as direct so you're looking at email and you're like it's not doing anything no it's just because you're not tagging it so email tagging is very very important and here's a little test that I do so I you know all ask clients are you talking your emails they all say oh yeah yeah I'll go into the roof all referrals report and then in the little filter here I'll just put mail and if a significant number of visits show up in there then I go back and say now you're not tagging because if all of the links were tagged then these wouldn't show up in your referral report they would show up in your campaigns report and then they say oh well you know we hired someone or we fired that guy or you know whatever all right so the next one what are your top performing product categories so typically when people use e-commerce reports they focus on products and but there is this other primary dimension called product category that I really like to focus on because it kind of buckets your your products and so you'll see here under primary dimension when you click on this report this product report is going to show up but check out that product category report and you'll see with this client their categories are set up copasetic lis however with another client this was a furniture client I did some on-site training for them I'm just going through their analytics teaching them as I'm there and I was like what road Jeffro these these aren't product categories these are stain colors they were so embarrassed because I mean I'm just doing a live demo and I'm like yeah there's a problem here so because you know I mean their product category should be like dining room living room bedroom because they're selling furniture who the heck cares oh oh how is our cherry furniture performing yeah so double check these make sure your your ecommerce is set up properly and here's another custom report because that's what I do all right another question should your psycho multilingual or multinational so I have a client who they they do lots of conferences and I was like going through all my clients and former clients data to try to find someone who you know could possibly have other countries show up and this particular client who does conferences they offer one in Israel and I was like ah found something so when I looked at their countries Israel actually showed up above the United States I was actually pretty surprising I thought I was just gonna have to you know focus on hypothetical and then you can also look at browser languages and you see here this is just capturing from the cookie whatever they've said is their default language in their browser you can see Hebrew a lot of visitors are visiting new speak Hebrew so I would make a case to them you know what you may want to consider another version offering another version of your site in Hebrew so that's how you can make that determination look at your bounce rates you know look at your conversions that kind of stuff here's a resource that lists the different language codes all right next which competitors are stalking you this isn't really that important but it's just kind of fun to look at so in this one report it's called Network yeah it's like network I can't really there's a glare but most people don't even know what this does and and one thing you need to understand is that the no yes network domain network domain is just the domain name of the registered service provider and most of them are going to be like the big is peace and and stuff but and then the other one just has like the actual URL so you can use either one and I just use a secondary dimension to get those side-by-side so I just included a little thing like that's that's what I chose to get those side-by-side and and you could see the specific network domain for is the referral and let's just move ahead so what you could do like well yeah another option is you can also look to see how many visits how many visitors are coming from gov sites or even edu sites that's interesting just by using these filters and and then you can when you identify your competitor so I had a chocolate client that was a brutal for three months I was you know reading about chocolate all the time they did at least send me a huge basket but I found out like your Delhi Hershey these big companies were stalking them left and right and and so I created an advanced segment to identify their competitors then once you have that segment you can close out of all visits and and stop your stalkers and say all right well let's see what landing pages they're looking at what are they doing when they come to my site it's so sketch and here are the steps to create the advanced segments and then you just apply it to your network report or anything else okay and this is where I say you can even add in landing page just to see where they're going when they land finally look to see our site scraping your site so this is one thing I do when I do in analytics audit and and the way and if you're if you do any kind of publishing this is actually more common than you might think the report for this is the hostname report here's where to find it and and I also use this secondarily to see if the client has subdomains but but this will tell you all of the domains that have your Google Analytics tracking code so if you have someone scraping your site like when I worked for the publishing company I hocked over this and when I found someone I would just shoot them off a cease-and-desist you know with our legal you know templates and stuff and I mean the lawyers weren't even involved they weren't planning on pursuing any of them but it scared the crap out of people but and they would they would move it and the reason it shows up as scrapers aren't really the sharpest knives in the drawer so when they scrape they're not typically going to go through and remove the Google Analytics tracking code so you can nab them all right so if you want to learn more I do have a bitly bundle you can find that at bitly micro Kampf bundle and that's just a list of all the links that I include and and here's where you can find my SlideShare bitly GA questions and thank you very much hi first of all thanks for the talk it's definitely helpful I'm trying to wrap my head around a lot of this stuff personally right now so I'm very pertinent to where I am I'm not responsible for damages I'll send you a we have a psychologist here somewhere in the multi click attribution there's a question about the tendency of people to go and search for your brand because they don't know that they can go directly to your URL so they go into Google and they search for your brand and then they click on it but of course that registers is organic traffic so like active I guess ways to try and differentiate that it's not really organic search like that it's basically a direct but they're just using Google for it yeah so back in the day before not provided has anyone heard of the whole not provided debacle yes so what happened was google analytics analytics this applies to all analyzed Google used to pass all of the search terms that people search Google for and landed on your site then bit by bit they started taking those away at first they said oh well if they're logged in to Google then we're not going to pass on their search terms and then eventually they said no you just can't have any of them so if you look at your organic search terms you're gonna see the lion's share shows up it's not provided and so back in the day before not provided you could actually set up a rule that said if someone search searches for like my domain so if someone search for analytics comm I could say don't count that as organic count that as direct but now it's kind of moot because we don't know you know like you get such a small percentage of actual search terms that you could still use that rule and I can send you a resource if you want to use it but it's not going to give you the insight that you're hoping for just because most of it is just being bucketed it's not provided thanks Obama yeah so do you know how to get the original tweet from the TCO link after you know 14 days or so yeah that's a really good question because the TCO link so up until a couple years ago you you had to tag social links you still should be tagging social links um I have to say that but but before I think it was about two and a half years ago Twitter set up this rapper called TCO so a lot of your visits from Twitter used to show up as direct because if people were using a desktop app like TweetDeck or HootSuite those were no referrer data was getting passed and they were showing up as direct and then Twitter said you know what let's just wrap all links more than 19 characters in this TCO wrapper and so now the bulk of your Twitter traffic will show up as TCO so I'm just saying that for the the benefit of the audience so we don't lose anyone and so when you look at that full referral report that I shared the custom report it actually has the exact TCO link so if you just copy and paste that into a browser it will take you to the the resource so like my campaign doc kind of went wild when I published it a few weeks ago and I could track that TCO link back to the actual resource I was checking out your website and I noticed that you are going to be offering online training courses your longer taking clients and and you're also doing seminars are you doing any in Northern California in the Sacramento San Francisco area and when or when do you plan to launch your online courses yes so that's a good question I have been testing these three days seminars and they've gone well but they're very difficult to market because I'm pulling people out of their jobs for three days and so I think the one I have coming up in Orlando in a couple weeks may possibly be my last one so many people have asked me to bring it online that I'm considering doing that so and then I'm gonna distill it down to one-day seminars of making data sexy like that's my tagline I make data sexy I teach other people how to make their data sexy I have tons of Excel tutorials Google Analytics tutorials and so and I'm in the middle of writing my first book making data sexy so I'm just trying to get through the book publishing process alive and then I'm gonna launch the online videos hi I'm Scott Nixon I you've completely like blown the way I'm gonna like look at analytics with the multi conversion stuff I mean it like I pretty much like obsessed with just looking at referrals and I've already seen that like that one of we recently started using Infusionsoft and I already see that it's like four times more valuable than I thought it was and so that's kind of an insane to me but I was just curious a lot oh I know a lot of people in this audience are doing more retargeting stuff and I was just curious if you had any advice around retargeting and tracking that stuff I mean I know you can use campaign URLs and stuff but it seems like some of that stuff is not ever making it into my analytics and I don't know if that's a tool problem they say it's not but I'm just curious so with your retargeting are you using campaign tagging or using their own tags yeah I'm using the UTM what are you tagging the media mess are you tagging it as display or I'm probably tagging it as Facebook or web because I'm not doing Facebook and like like about Boehner ad retargeting yes so we can talk more but that's not going to show up in the right bucket in either your multi-channel funnels report or your main channels report because the medium has to be set to bigger buckets and I go into this a lot in my whole guide I like literally draw buckets and you know and I'm like you know explaining like of the of all the parameters medium is the most critical to get right so so if that's how you're tagging them that definitely explains why you're under reporting and a really good practice to make is going to your multi-channel funnels report and everything that Google couldn't figure out what it was just gets bucketed as other good click on other and drill down and it will show you the sources and look to see are those actually other or am I just miss tagging something also like if you're doing social clicking your referral drill down and look at the sources and see wait a minute are are my seeing social sites because if so then I need to be tagging those as social one other little note about that is and this is I don't know how many people are doing Adsense but if you have text ads as opposed to banners for whatever reason Google is classifying them as other not they're still in the CPC bucket the paid bucket but it's it doesn't show up the way you might expect it but it anyway so yeah I would and if you want I can just like look it look at it and kind of you know click around thank you again any hey thanks guys you [Applause]
