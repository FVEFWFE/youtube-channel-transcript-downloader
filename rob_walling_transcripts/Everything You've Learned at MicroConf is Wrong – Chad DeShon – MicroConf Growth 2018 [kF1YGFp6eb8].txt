[Music] [Applause] hi I'm Chad I had a job as a software engineer for seven years I loved it and then I did something really Micro comfy I started a business working nights and weekends it was b2b SAS I charged more than I was comfortable with I took sales calls in my car over lunch time with fortune 500 companies and I followed all this advice and it worked the business was called Brom bone we did JavaScript SEO for all these angularjs react these kind of websites basically if there's a bunch of JavaScript on the on the webpage then Google can't read it right sometimes and we had fixed that for small customers and big customers it went well I grew it quit my job we got to about 20km RR and then I kind of fell back to to what I known I'd always had side projects before so I started another one and it started to get some traction yeah yeah I decided to sell Brom bone and focus on my new business what was that new business well since everything had gone gone so well with Brom bow and I thought why not do the complete opposite this time board game tables comm sells tables physical literal tables shipped on semi trucks sold to consumers our average customer owns probably about 500 board games these tables are all custom built to order in Joplin Missouri they have prices range from two thousand to seven thousand dollars for a table b2c does not have to mean low prices it does not have to mean price sensitive customers and I was so on tables so I decided maybe we can get even less microcon fee with this business and I moved down market I want you to Kickstarter for a new budget model of this table that started at 500 is some assembly required manufactured in China and that kickstart to raise 2.6 million dollars we sold over three thousand tables yeah I don't know about you but it's a lot of money where I'm from but here's the thing with physical products when you screw stuff up it cost a lot of money to fix it and we spend a lot of money fixing a lot of problems I did not get to keep nearly as much of that 2.6 million dollars as I should have but still business is good we continue to sell the budget tables at a profit and we continue to sell the custom tables and so now I've kind of seen both sides of things I've done b2b SAS and I've done ecommerce and so I just kind of want to share with you some things I've learned from the other side of the fence if you will and maybe you can use these points as not like an absolute truth but as a jumping-off point to think about your business from a different angle so here we go recurring revenue is overrated and this is because it doesn't it doesn't all recur every month you've still got to bring new customers and to replace the ones to leave and this gets harder and harder as you grow until eventually your new customers are just replacing the churn and your em are our flatlines I bet most people in this room Oh a lot of you have had to deal with this at some point it's not the end of the world you're still making money but it's a reminder that even if we call this recurring revenue it really still all comes down to lifetime value every time you get a new customer in the door that's worth a certain amount of money one time sales are underrated because I'm not actually starting to zero every month sure I don't have any customers lined up to give me money next month but my marketing is still there and if you ask me how many tables am I gonna sell in May I'm gonna say well about the same number of tables I sold in April the SEO still works the Facebook Ads store on word-of-mouth engine still goes my email list still sells so the same number of new customers gonna find me again so just like sass every new customer in the door is worth a certain amount of money and just like SAS if I can keep my LTV hired them my cost to acquire a customer and the cost to ship them the thing that they ordered I make profit and the more customers I bring in in that way the more profit I get LTV kind of abstracts away the difference between a one-time sale and recurring revenue and one great thing about it one-time sales is we get all of our money upfront unless of course you're holding inventory that's that's a whole nother ballgame probably doesn't apply to most of you but recurring revenue you have a different advantage you have more lovers you can pull to increase your your LTV and this specifically I mean if you can decrease churn or you can increase expansion revenue you can dramatically increase your lifetime value that is the true advantage of recurring revenue you are paying a penalty when you have recurring revenue of having delayed income and you're paying a penalty of having a harder sale so make sure you're getting that benefit of decreasing your churn and increasing your expansion revenue because that's where the real benefit is don't force a business model on to a business where it doesn't make sense get value where your from your customer where they're getting value from you if they're getting their value upfront charge upfront if they're getting their values charge spread out and so that kind of brings up the question can I get my money up front and also get it spread out no those those words are opposites you can't do both but but we want to anyway right and so this is point number two it leads me to when I sold Brahm bow and I used a broker I used to Fe international and they started asking me all these questions about my annual plans and I didn't I do not understand why at first businesses are generally sold on a multiple of last month or less 12 months profit but what I didn't know is that sometimes sellers won't give you full credit in that question for annual plan so you've sold in the last 12 months and I'm not just letting my pro rating for the services you haven't provided yet saying that when calculating value your businesses sometimes not all the time but sometimes annual recurring revenue is considered less valuable the monthly recurring revenue and why is that because annual plans can be used to mask churn problems all of our customers are churning after four months what do you think we should do about it I know huge discount get him to give us all their money up front before they realize our software sucks don't mask your turn problems fix them instead and I yea just fix them right way easier said than done but it's also way better long term to fix the problem if you're masking it you're just hiding it from yourself and that's the worst person to hide it from and if you are going to keep annual plans monitor those users and find out if they have stopped using your product and consider them to be churned when they've stopped using not when they've stopped paying fix the problem at that point you should be doing this really with your monthly plan users as well some customers are just destined to churn right with bran boma you get startups that was sign up and then they got a business and I don't think there was anything I could do to fix that and so maybe there's an argument there yeah let's get the money from them upfront while we can before before they go under I don't know but I think that kind of misses the point your path to growth is not squeezing as much as you can out of your bad customers your path to growth is making your product great for your good customers there are reasons have annual plans just make sure if you're going to do it you're doing it because it's right for your business and not because that's what everybody else is doing and if you're not restricted by cash flow then I'd give a serious pause before offering big discounts for this we've been on to point number three moving down market as possible but it's different than charging less when I launched the new table on Kickstarter that table was clearly differentiated from our high dollar table and differentiated that's marketing speak for not as good and but it brought us two new customers who were never never going to buy our more expensive tables now we did lose some sales to cannibalization we also got more sales of the hi doll our tables because the low dollar table gave us more brand awareness it's been a lot of work if this were my starter this shouldn't I would just say no don't do it you can't move down market don't even try but this is growth so I want to say it's possible just make sure your product is different make sure you're targeting and audiences both new and larger and be ready to work there's a lot I still don't understand about this it's tricky it's really situational so moving on to point number four a great thing about b2b software a great thing about b2b businesses the reason people tell you to start these b2b companies is that if you can just show positive ROI a business pretty much has to sign up right I mean after all that's that's what businesses do they can give you $1,000 and it makes them $2,000 it's a no-brainer but the great thing about b2c is I don't have to show par as a positive ROI yeah you guys know it's is not as easy as it sounds to prove it right there's opportunity costs they're set up expenses there's attribution problems did did we really get that sale because we're using our software what we've sold it to them anyway with b2c I just have to make them want it look at this pretty picture do you want the thing in the picture give me money you can have the thing that that's what it comes down to logic can be tricky ROI can be tricky but want you can want anything and here's a secret businesses are people when a business buys your product a person is making that decision what can you do to make them want it this is hard with beetus b2b but I think it's still possible is your product pretty or all the cool kids using it does it make them feel more professional can they brag about it to the friends what can you do to make them want your product for no logical reason at all I'm afraid I may not have been quite the controversial talk some you're looking for so let me give you one more point before I leave seriously relax take a deep breath you do not have to cram information into your ears as fast as possible allow your mind to wander have its own thoughts and go on its own tangents it'll be okay sewing tables is different than selling software but people are people I hope I've helped you look at your business just a little bit differently thank you you
