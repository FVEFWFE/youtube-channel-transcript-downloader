how do i add my slides there you go awesome hey everyone my name is narela luniva and today we're going to talk about how to turn your product documentation from collect and dust to sas growth engine if you have it if you don't have it then i'll share some cheat codes how you can create it uh product documentation is often an afterthought for many founders and i'd like to show you how it can be used as actually a lead generation so my name is narella von neva and in addition to growing our own sas company with my husband i'm also co-founder at a company called outbreaking narayo which is an seo content research writing and optimization tool i'm also a growth and marketing consultant to sas founders and i help sales companies identify and implement high roi opportunities why high roi opportunities because founders especially who don't have marketing background when asked when they're asking an seo specialist do i need uh help with seo of course seo specialist is going to say yes you need help with seo if they're asking do you need help with content well of course content person is going to say yes you need content do i need help with pay-per-click yes you need help with pay-per-click and all of them are right in in their own way right like who is guilty of that i am actually checking the chat here as well so if you put guilty here that would be awesome i know that it's not just me and the founders that i uh that i had a pleasure working with um so i full disclosure i'm not a technical product documentation writer i'm a marketer so the advice that's gonna come here right now is from the growth perspective um and if you have any questions type them in the chat i only have 20 minutes left so i'm going to try and answer them while i'm writing this session so my promise to you today is what you learn how to analyze your product documentation effectiveness number two is best practices to ensure it's not just their sitting and collecting best and number three is ways to improve conversion rate at least by 10 maybe a little bit more maybe like 50 uh conversion rate on your website which is awesome i love when we're able to improve conversion rate on the website which means that without doing anything you're just all of a sudden getting more leads more conversions more sales which is awesome so let's try and make it a little bit more interactive i want to know in your opinion what is average user path that a user takes on the website when they land on a sas website where do they usually go so majority of the times and i'm looking at the comments so feel free to drop something there but pricing so some says home pricing and about okay very good yes majority of the times people will first land on the homepage next they're gonna check price and page you guys are right and then next they're gonna check something like integrations features and then the last one is gonna be probably about page so this is majority of the times but did you know that people will also land on your product documentation is their first page if you have a product documentation pages then people will actually land there and can actually convert into trials from your product documentation page isn't awesome so not sure if it's uh if you're able to see that but this is an example and i'm going to share with you by the way don't worry about this is from google analytics screenshot i am going to share with you exactly the view that you can use to go here but what we're looking at here is the mo the sixth most popular page where people convert into a trial is actually none of the pages that we talked about but it's actually a product documentation page this page number six by popularity uh and how many sign ups to a trial uh that page had which is pretty awesome huh you probably didn't know that so today i'm gonna show you how you can do this and how you can check for yourself what are some pages that are popular on your website so overall the benefits of having product documentation pages are multiple number one obviously it can bring you seo and traffic which i just proved to you number two is it's actually helping you decrease support ticket uh volume people don't wanna contact your support uh despite what you're thinking like so many people just you know contact me and ask weird questions people don't wanna do that they wanna self-serve um it's also going to help you reduce churn and streamline your onboarding um increase your customer success and happiness and overall this is all going to translate into conversions improving conversions from visitor to trial from trial to paid which is you know good for everyone some prerequisites that i'd like you that you are gonna need to have is uh you need to have google analytics set up on your website go ahead and by the way start opening your google analytics if you have it just go ahead and open because they're going to be a couple of things that we are going to be checking in your google analytics right now so this is a hands-on session okay number two is that your google analytics is present on the support pages because a lot of times i see that somehow the google analytics code is missing from those pages it is present on home page on price and page but not the product documentation pages if you have them and number three is if you have and this is probably a little bit more for advanced users if you have goals set up in google analytics so those are the three things that uh ideally you need to have if you don't that that's fine as well at least just keep in mind the things that you need to have in place and something that you can check a little bit later so let's analyze your product documentation together right now we'll do it hopefully you have your google analytics i'm checking some comments here hopefully you have your google analytics open already uh my question to you how often do you guys and ladies check your google analytics because this this thing kills me really so many times founders like log in there maybe once every other month because and that's totally fine if you do because probably you don't know what you're looking at so today i'm going to share with you the things that you can check in your google analytics and then you're probably going to want to log in there you know at least once a week and this is my recommendation because you need to know what's happening there as well so if you are in yoga no analytics i'd like you to go to let me increase the size of this to uh so you go into your google analytics uh analytics.google.com you then go under your behavior and then content drill down and then in this great view which i know you probably have not have never went there and logged in there but under behavior and then site content and content drill down you're gonna be able to see what are your most popular clusters of pages so for example like folders of pages right so for example here the number one most popular page is obviously the homepage and then all the content that you have under support page is going to be is the second most popular visited uh cluster of pages and then the pricing page is the third most popular so i really want to hear what are your number one two three most popular pages page clusters i really want to know i i want to know okay blocks and some on the same blog once a week okay someone's checking once a week which is awesome what are number two and number three most popular cluster of pages oftentimes it is home page then the next time is like blog or pricing and for some companies you're actually gonna see support and this is the killer that you are gonna find very interesting so someone says home blog program team documentation is number one woohoo jane awesome then you're gonna be so excited to to see what's coming next all right let me pull back here i need to get to my clicker there you go next view that i wanted to go to and check is to go under conversions if you have those set up because if you don't you need to work on them but then next you go to conversions goals and then reverse goal path and then what's awesome here is you're going to be able to see which pages people visit right before they hit the goal which is convert on a trial you have them set up then this is a gold mine for you make sure to check that as well but in this particular case hold on i'm looking at a couple of you commenting here um in this particular case you'll see that there's actually a lot of product documentation pages that are bringing conversion and so by the way while you were at it while you were in google analytics as a marketer and it says killer if you've been given access to other people in the past in google analytics make sure make sure to go and delete those people if you no longer work with them because otherwise they have access to a lot of things that you don't want them to have access to okay and so if you look at here there's uh a lot of around three percent of all conversions page num uh line number six and then there's another uh one percent and then we see a couple more percentage points so you can see actually here that a lot of conversions are happening on those pages then the last thing that i'm going to torture you today with is go to reverse goal path and then you're going to be able to see that all the pages actual pages that are bringing you the conversions and need your goals set up properly in this case this is what i see line number two line 9.5 and line number eight together they bring 12 of all trial conversions in addition to pricing pages integration pages home pages did you ever you know did you ever think that this is possible that your product documentation pages actually can bring in conversions not only that so just overall total percentage for this pages for this particular sas company is 12 of all conversions to trial is coming from those participation pages and that is they didn't even have a call to action on those product documentation pages isn't it crazy how many of you have or do not have call to action on product documentation pages if you don't then you can easily increase your website conversion if you're getting traffic to those product documentation you can increase your website conversion tr overall from visitor to trial which is crazy without doing anything just adding those buttons without needing to spend any money on pay-per-click or adding more traffic or content or guest blog posts or anything you can increase number of trials isn't crazy so let's talk about the creation process so the creation process for product documentation pages and those are the cheat codes that i'm going to share with you there are two number one is when a request comes in that you haven't seen before and you don't have a product documentation talking about this particular issue and a person has asked you know submitted a ticket for example please i beg you do not respond with long elaborative email and text in the email one on one right to this person what you need to do is you need to take all everything that you written down the answer ideally you also have like a walkthrough uh video that you can upload to youtube or whatever and then add that as well and create a page this is the easiest way for you to start creating those pages if you take it as a rule that every single time when someone creates a ticket and you need to provide new information that is not publicly available on your product documentation page please create a separate product documentation page and then send the link to the product documentation page to this person do not answer in private okay number two is i encourage you to start writing weekly q a sessions with your existing customers with all of your prospects with leads someone who took you up on the trial and didn't convert someone who converted so everyone you want to include everyone and you want to invite them to a weekly session and this is gonna be also like this is so powerful not a lot of companies do that in fact i don't know maybe like one percent of all sales companies do that if not less this is goldmine what you do is on a weekly basis you have one hour call with everyone and what you do you invite uh your existing database of everyone to those weekly calls you don't want to award it so that uh you know you are showing all of your features and stuff like that because this is not about you in particular this is about you learning what people want why they didn't sign up to your trial if they sign up why they didn't convert this was very interesting i hosted multiple sessions like this for multiple sas companies as a first step and they said that we were trying to get people to get on the call with us like half a month have a half an hour call uh and you know sure why is it just over all their feedback right and it is a big ask well if you invite people to join your weekly sessions and those sessions can be structured a little bit like a mastermind so for example if your tool let's say a marketing automation tool then you can talk about just overall market information you can bring a couple of examples from your particular tool you can share the screen uh how your tool helps do that but overall you talk about marketing information you get people to introduce themselves talk about which company you're there with which will help in this people to bond and then they're much more likely to connect with each other and if you're going to have existing customers this happened yesterday on a call like this existing customer joined and they were raving about the tool and so all of those leads that are currently just sitting them just wondering should i sign up or not this is the best you know sas tool out this customer was raving about the tool and she said i love it i've tried you know number one number two number three i hated it and then this you guys you're just absolutely awesome so do not miss on this opportunity run those weekly sessions um quick tip here if you already have product documentation pages you can check uh go to outrank.io this is a sas company that i'm a co-founder at and then you can check uh you can go click on the home page c in action and then you can check the pages that are that you can basically convert into a little bit more seo optimized pages as well so the ai power is actually doing this for you you just plug in your website and then you'll be able to see what are some pages that are low-hanging fruits that you can convert you can create into a little bit more seo optimized piece of content this is if you already have product implementation pages i'll share a little bit about the common problems that i see a lot of founders do with their product documentations and that is number one is uh what you want to add in those uh hold on it is creation process um so you want to include multiple like multimedia content into your product documentation pages which includes videos so for example if you are able to show a walkthrough like a screen share or if you have recordings of those weekly sessions um then you can include it into your product documentation which is again improving your seo value and juice and google absolutely loves that you can include screenshots then just overall structured text is important uh case status uh interlinking is also important so any uh any interlink in your internal from let's say your product documentation into another page is considered an extra backlink which is great we want to do that uh breadcrumbs are important both for google and for user experience so included there by the way cannot stress it enough it is important for google okay so breadcrumbs ideally you want to have there and ctas do not forget cdas remember this is like the biggest point of this presentation is ctas should not be missing from the next some of the problems that i see a lot of companies do is number one they don't have google analytics number two they don't have cdas we talked about this number three is no keyword research using a free google tool or you can go to our ranking that i o and it's also gonna give you some options uh to check for keyword uh volume and then you optimize for that uh not having breadcrumbs and problems with the interlinking and subdomain versus folder there is one letter missing folder so this is a big one a lot of uh what a lot of founders do is they use like a subdomain something like support that's the name of the website.com for example we don't want to do that we want to have a folder because if you do it as a subdomain then you are not passing the juice from the website to those product documentation pages and google is not gonna rank it as high so we want it to be a folder okay um and i need to switch between the screen so that's why there's a little bit of delay so overall conclusion percentage of traffic that visits your product documentation pages hopefully you were able to check that this is important if you have zero okay then you probably don't have any product documentation pages you know that you need to work a little bit on i shared with you how you want to do that number one is you want to create weekly sessions number two never answer long eruptive email um always put it as a separate page okay that you can then everyone else can see it as well uh you can also uh hopefully you were able to analyze number of trials that come from your product documentation pages for some companies uh it can be 12 for some companies it can be 20 depending on the size of your product implementation pages and then hopefully you have planned how to improve your existing pages you know now that you need to add cta buttons call to action buttons by the way i don't know if you mentioned it but cta stands for call to action buttons so have them on your product recommendation pages this is important hopefully you're going to start your weekly q a sessions and i really want to hear what feedback you're going to get out of this if you start those request sessions please reach out to me i really want to hear um your feedback if you uh improve your reach out to me again i'm not an expert in product documentation specifically writing it this presentation was about uh growth tactics and channels and uh just product recommendation is one of and that is it uh my website is narelloniva.com i'm also sas boss community and podcasts and we do a lot of different things as well so thank you so much uh we have couple of minutes for q a so if anyone has any questions i see that there are some uh some comments here let me go over them what tools do folks use in addition to google tools for search keyword research out ranking that io is one of i would say google is a good tool go ahead and use that um i would recommend at least those two start with the google check out our rankin.io as well what do you think is the best way to embed ctas in the documentation without annoying existing customers maybe in the city ask them to sign or log in and do not show the cta to login users now if you are able to do that that is great i think if you can't i don't think that you're gonna annoy existing users and by the way you can also check uh in google analytics the percentage of traffic is that goes to your pages is this existing traffic or new traffic and this is also going to give you an idea whether those cta buttons call to action buttons you know what make them are they uh just create a demo or ask a demo or create a trial which i don't think it's gonna annoy existing users so just check the percentage of people that visit your product recommendation pages and hopefully there's also going to be an eye opening for you if you're going to find that a lot of first-time users enter your website through documentation this is awesome this is awesome how do you handle if the opposite happens a customer is having issue with the tool and scares away a prospect oh in the during the weekly sessions you know what uh i i don't think that a lot of people will actually be as vocal if they had a problem they would actually be appreciative of you hosting those sessions uh and so even if someone is not 100 happy we know that there's you know some users they're always not going to be happy so that's totally fine so you can just uh address that oh yes i remember we had such a problem you know jane uh hopefully our fix worked for you and usually they're not as vocal no one's gonna come and just you know talk bad stuff about you on those weekly sessions usually they just don't show up and looks like what time is best for weekly q a okay we have a lot of questions about wikileaks which is awesome i really want you guys to try that we have one minute left and this is probably going to be one last questions that i'm going to take during the day number one where is majority of your customers are do you know if they're somewhere in the u.s or somewhere in europe like this is going to depend like really where your customer base is if they're in the u.s then u.s time zone usually around lunchtime if there is somewhere in asia i don't know about the preference there in asia i am here for u.s audience i am writing around lunchtime between 12 and 2 maybe 11 and 2. um right now i'm working with someone in europe but majority of their user base is in the us um and so we're doing this around 10 a.m central i think overall between 11 and 2 p.m central is a good time if your folks are in the uh in the us and that's it looks like excellent natalie thank you so much absolutely what's my pleasure
