[Music] thank you very much for being here and I would like to before starting with the talk I would like to ask you a question do you remember the first time you heard your your recorded voice how did that feel did did you like it can someone that likes that can raise it in their hand so it it really felt strange to me and I remember the first time it happened to me when I was 10 years old and I'm my father recorded that on those tape recorders and I heard that back and I said oh looks pretty bad and I never I put that away and I thought that there were some some issues with the with the recording but a few a few years later I recorded that back at cd-quality so I knew that it was okay and discarded was completely different so that made me think that in in certain situation what we think is the reality sometimes is someone else something else so my reality for that experience was different from all the reality of all the other people in the world and this happens technically because you are hearing your your voice not only through your ears but also through the vibration of your bones creating a unique experience for you so the same thing for for me and I think for all of you that are single founders is happening with your with your business as well because you have a personal view of your business that is different from the view that can up your your customers your prospects or all the other people so there is a gap between your experience and their experience and if you are not aware of this gap you can run into problems and this is exactly what happened to me when when I started my my business and how many of you are technical founders people that really that that builder can you raise your hand okay okay see so quite a few and I was a technical founder as well when when I started and I just used the old-school approach hi I always been interested in automating things and I wanted to build my my own thing and I I I thought about what would be cool and what would would I need and I ended up creating a text expansion software I thought that if I needed that other people would need as well so I just you know I didn't do any validation I didn't do anything I just started straight up coding and I thought that other people would come so once I finished I put all the feature that I told where were interesting and then I put it online and then I thought that well people will come right but that that's not the exactly would happen so once I put the thing online I put that in a form I had no idea what what marketing was except for you know posting some forums or do things like that and people were not coming I get some some people that were buying the software and I was averaging between three started with three hundred dollars per month and went up to eight hundred amount adding more more features but you see that this this graph is not exactly do you hockey stick roughly we like to see so and this has been going on for for a few years and the only way that I knew to you know try to improve sales was just to you know create a redesign or starting from adding features or something like that so you see that after five years this kind of thing is not you know very exciting so I was at the point where I was losing motivation and at the time I was I was having a day job so I was focusing more and more on my on my day job especially when I when I got an interesting offer to to go and work in Singapore so I thought that this at this point I was you know I am you file I currently live in in Italy and I moved to Singapore from one year in 2010 and I get a quite interesting job there and I thought that basically my side project was you know what's going to remain a side project for me but you know sometimes when when you expect some something released this is when when something that you don't expect Atmos I don't know if I think that if you've been in business for quite some time you can think of an event or or someone that created a big change in your life a person or something that that gives you a boost and where you can clear it see a before and after and AB this person I'm sorry I'm this guy I met this guy in Singapore he's a business consultant has been working in Silicon Valley his name is Anton town and you can read up more about him at his blog and I met this guy bye-bye chances was I was going to work and we we start we start talking and we see that we were going along pretty well and the nice thing about him he was working with with startups but had a very different take on on business I've seen people here talking about business and I always saw business as a way to you know to make money to get freedom you know things about myself things about I could get for me this guy was more focused on so a business as a way to help other people and he was you know he was talking about startups as a way to make people help other people to solve problems he was work in social business and other stuff and it was nice because we we had some we ended up trading business business consultation for Italian dinner so that was very good and as we were eating a homemade pizza and we I was talking about my frustration with her with my business he say something that really struck me I was concerned about not being able to to make sales so I I couldn't find enough customer for tour for my business and they say that it's it's not how you sell its widely by and this has really changed the perspective because it's it's not being focused on yourself on your product but it's being focused on on the people that you are actually helping with your with your with your mood your problem with what you are doing and the the point that he was making that you have a business because you want to help people in a in a sustainable way because if you don't have a business so you you don't get paid for that you at the certain point you can no longer help them so from from this sorry I'm having this conversation with him really changed everything about my business and I understood that I was completely off with what roof orders I was doing so far because I I didn't even know if if the product that I had was was really satisfying I need I didn't know anything about that so was that really useful as hidden so I was just driving blind at this point and I also didn't know anything about the the audience that I was targeting to so I just you know thought about the idea I just put it out and that was it for me so I needed to do something about that and I decided that I needed to find out and to find it out I decided that I want you to call my customer had cost customer that have been returning to my that have purchased for me for for more than one more than one time and I decide that co-lead am having a conversation with them was the best way to really understand what was going on so I basically focused on three phases in their journey when discovering my my solution the first one was understanding what was the the problems that were having I had no idea of what problems they were having I was just thinking that they had to do things more efficiently but that doesn't mean anything for that and with with those course that I made I understood that there are a lot of doctors use my software and that they have very specific problems with the changes that are going on here in the US with the documentation that they are required to apply so I discovered that they are using that to to create their notes and they are using templates and that I was saving for them up to three hours per day so that was good to know the second important part is to understand what was the pain sorry what was the experience that they they were having with using the software what was it easy for them to to use it to get started - to put it to work - having delivered the information that the value that I was giving to them and I discovered that it was not was way too technical it was very hard for them to and I discovered that one had been talking to a few doctors and they were having a degree in medicine but also degree in engineering so I said I must be off and the the third thing is to define exactly what are the benefits that they were having so it's not just saving time or saving money I wanted to understand what was the the the benefit that they were bringing home and for most of them was you know being able to spend a weekend with the family not doing their notes or getting more time to things and other told me that it was avoid them from being sued as well so so at this point hi I gather all this information from 2030 calls of different people and I needed to collect all them and making them useful to to move things forward so this new this started a new journey and that was on two aspects one was redesigning the software and the other one was recreating the the marketing copy so regarding the software I needed to remove all the technical things and all the technical language that I I put in I I guess I see some people nodding at I think some of you can recognize it that and to make the process of getting started very very easy and the other thing that was even more important was to be enabled on the on the website on the market copy to resonate with them resonates means that when they get to your to your websites they see the solution that you are offering and they understand that this is not something that they can use or they they can adapt to what they are doing but this is something that was made just for them and to do this side I found that the the the course and the books offer of jonahwy both copiers were really great and she talks about the voice of the customers so you need to extract the information that the the the words that the customers used to describe the problem to describe the solution take it out and reflect on that on on your website and doing this this change so focusing really on on the customer created a big change in the business as well so as you can see from from 2000 basically in 2011 I work after the redesign of the website and the page and in 2012 I get a significant improvement in say and also in 2013 and I was basically able to 10x the the business in in a couple of years and this has been done without working on acquisition no paid advertising no no no mark no nothing just working on the website and working on a message that I was sending to two people and right now my main major challenge is to improve the traffic on the website and get it in front of more people but even without much traffic and I say that this conversation this massive change has been a game-changer for for my business I was very worried about calling the customers and I never had done that before but I discovered that when I called them they were very happy to to to talk to me and they thanked me at the end of the call because they were able to explain what which are the problems that were having and I was able to track my help them find a solution so my final remark to to this is that if you are word or am afraid of calling your customers and you think that it's or you think it's it's a waste of time I suggest that you you don't be because it's really the best time I ever spent to grow my business so that's it thank you
