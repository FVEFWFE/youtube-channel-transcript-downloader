================================================================================

[Music] we finished the day out on a high note here I want to share some lessons that I've learned over the past really over the past two years that's been almost two years since Tripp was acquired in in July of 2016 and you know this I had 16 years of bootstrapping and then two years essentially inside a well-funded company and there's obviously both good and bad that you notice on both sides of it once you've done both and so this is just one man's experience but you know it's I hope that it's valuable to y'all today so true micro fashion we often have photos of our families because this after all is why I do all of this right like I started businesses so that I can have more time and a better lifestyle to spend with with my family and this is us less than a month ago on the lake by our house Minneapolis in the background we moved there two years ago after that acquisition and for those of you who have been a previous micro cops keeping account of my kids yes there's an extra child and episode 146 of Zen founder explains what that is but we are legal guardians of a little girl as well now and this is as seeing Hamilton in Chicago highly recommend Hamilton really really good musical so all right with the family stuff aside I want to dive in to very quickly recapping I talked a lot about this in my last year talk but kind of the story so far and how I how I got here so I started RIP in 2012 and with my co-founder Derek rhymer who's here in the audience we built it up over the next three years and we came to a kind of a crossroads where I was like alright we need to raise a little bit of money because we're pretty cash-strapped growing so quickly that we were ahead of cash flow so we should raise some money or you know we should potentially one day respond to some of these acquisition offers we're getting and we had several people trying or wanting to acquire us and so ultimately we settled on what turned out to be a really good deal for both parties and we were acquired by leadpages agreed to be acquired July of 2016 and so that meant that we moved to Minneapolis which from California is obviously a big shift winners are long the winners are cold and my kids look like this when they go to school in the winter but man it's a such a cool city and so we've really enjoyed that and you know my tenure with Tripp actually just recently ended so I left that's why the get a job song and the unemployed on my badge I did leave I have no job right now and I lost about a week ago but one of the things as you know as we were moving to Minneapolis and I was going to enter this world of a venture funded company and to run a product you know I became VP of Product basically running drip under that umbrella the good news is I had I knew that there would be a lot of learning from it right and I always look at my my seasons I typically have 18 to 24 months seasons of things as just a big learning experience to learn a new experience so before drip I was doing hit tail which was you know about 10 times smaller and before hit till I was doing things were about 10 times smaller than that and so I always think what can I learn and so a good friend of mine Reuben gamma is with bid sketch also here he asked me what are you planning to learn from this experience I knew I was gonna learn stuff but I really wanted to think deliberately you know about it and so I had this whole thing in my mind of like well like leadpage is really good at top of funnel marketing they're good at raising funding like this stuff they're good at and I'm hopefully all you know kind of learn from that and none of that stuff is actually what I came away with what I came away with were the differences between the bootstrapping world and and the funded world and how we operate differently and I today I'm gonna share those with you and five of them are negative things are things that I saw from the inside where I thought I think funding kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] some things up here and then seven of them are things that if I were to ever you know start another one that I would do differently because of what I learned working at leadpages so I went on CrunchBase they have in fact raised 38 million dollars so it's it's out better funded than most even most VC funded startups this is this is a lot it's it's over three rounds according to crunch based and so you know I did go to my wife who you just heard from and I told her you know I think there's a lot I can learn over this next you know in next couple years year two or I didn't know how long it would be at the start and I said but obviously I'm gonna learn it just to share with others because I'm not gonna do I'm really not gonna do another one of these and so you know she looked me in the eye and and dr. walling said you know what Rob I think that that is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that you are gonna do another one and so that remains to be seen but yeah so the interesting thing about the funded world so I'm going to talk a little bit about VC funding and I'm gonna talk about some some alternatives to that I am NOT I've never been anti funding I have always been kind of anti funding is the only way to start a business right and that's why I started blogging in 2005 and then we started the conference is because there was no one talking about this stuff so even you go back to my book which I wrote I think it was 2010 or 2011 that it came out and this is a section from the intro I hadn't read my book in years and then we got a question on the podcast and I went back and and looked through it and I was like I don't even remember saying this but this is still how I feel right eight years later so I am NOT anti venture capital but I'm anti everyone thinking venture capital is the only way to start a tech company and I point out the differences if you're self-funded or boot strapped with one or two founders you can support your entire business from a tiny niche that provides 20k month in revenue and that's that's pretty sweet right that's that's why we're here and that's why we bootstrap is because it's just so damn much easier but with venture capital or angel funding you're forced to go after much larger markets and a market that's ten times the size is a hundred times harder to get right there's so much more competition complexity ad rates and stuff so so I come before you as someone who has always tried to keep an open mind and not use always and never about anything you know I'd never say never hooey like that I never say you know I would never raise funding or I would always do this but to look to feel like there's a learning experience inside every endeavor you know and it's the same reason that it's starter on on Wednesday Thursday I will be sitting over in that seat taking copious notes because I believe that we all have stuff to learn from each other so I'm going to start off with the bad and I really debated where there's start with the good and end with the bad but I'm gonna do the bad and I'm a big Clint Eastwood fan so I'm gonna kick it off with the bad we're not gonna do the ugly today that will be an outtake that I publish on my youtube channel later no I'm just kidding I'm not going to do that so the bad is the stuff that even at so you know after working at this company for two years like the the company's well well structured the the people are nice you know it's like it's it's not I don't think it's a typical of a lot of intra company so right a venture front of companies it's not like some cluster in there but I did see that these things were very noticeable as we went for we're a 10-person company in essence when we got acquired and we were then at a hundred and fifty person venture founded company so these are the five things that I noticed right off the bat the first one is that communication was a brutal so what used to happen when we were gonna build a new feature is I would turn to Derek who sat next to me and all right should we build this feature and then we would stand up at the whiteboard we'd go into our office which is stand over here and then we'd sketch it out and then we take a picture of it and then we throw it in essentially github and then Anna who is working customer success for us and we'd say hey we're gonna build this feature it'll be live in a week okay well when it's you know almost ready to go I'm gonna try it and learn how to do it and then we email our support guy he was a remote and we'd say here's a screenshot that's how it's gonna work and we had one support guy so there's no training he would just I figured out how to use it and then we would we tell Zach and be like all right let's let's try to market this and that was it and so it was like there were four or five people it was really easy and then we blog and tell our customers and you know profit once we were inside a larger organist it's moving fast cuz if you're let's say you're in a 150 person org but it's a really slow and you're not doing a lot and it's just plateaued and it's not venture funded communication can be slow and that's okay right because you're not moving at a pace where you need to communicate quick but when you're launching multiple features a week and you're 150 people it was like okay and we need to tell our customers and we're gonna build this feature and it's gonna go live in a month so I can't wait until two days before to go tell the marketing apartment because it's not just Zach anymore it's ten people and they have a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] going on right but they they're trying to get stuff out so now I'm like all right so I'm gonna schedule a meeting with marketing two or three weeks in advance even though we don't estimate exactly when features are gonna go live so it's like I don't know if this is two or three weeks and it could get you know if gdpr or like spammers start attacking us it's actually gonna be two or three months but I already scheduled the meeting and we have to teach support how to use it which is now 14 people because we went from 10 to you know 150 and customer success and sales which we didn't have before and I had to keep the CEO and the CMO in you know up to speed on what we were building and it all has to get done and bigger orgs you just have to do this and everybody knows communication is hard but I found myself saying sometimes to myself and sometimes out loud at times I feel like I spend more time talking about building product than actually building product so I built way more slide decks than I wanted to and again there was not a lot of red tape at leadpages or there isn't a lot I should say and yet just communicating to that many people is really hard and so that was something I'd I certainly didn't enjoy the second thing is that just like I thought board meetings are a pain in the ass they really are and the thing is is I didn't even take the brunt of the board meetings you know the Jason Heath is the CFO of drip and leadpages he's here in the audience he was working with the CEO for weeks on decks and and pulling numbers together and I basically got to saunter in and do about 30 minutes on the product and say this is the roadmap and talk I've taught my head but I did have to kind of rehearse it and I had to get slides in and so I'd spend about a week thinking about it putting it in and it changed to change at the last minute and I find that things were different so I found that I spent just for this I think it was a it's not a quarterly or every six weeks there were dozens if not 50-plus man-hours or person hours between all of us and again I probably spent five hours that everybody else spent more time but it was like huh that kind of sucks like that to me that's all it is it's just overhead right it's not moving the product forward now it's moving the company forward but it wasn't something that I enjoy and it was one reason you're kind of one thing in my mind that was like it's another reason why I wouldn't go personally go VC funded right it's it supported that so the number three thing is that culture really is hard and this is something I don't know if this happens that I know what happens at bigger companies but when you are hiring quickly and you are bringing people into the fold and you're trying to get you know fifty people in a year in your door or a hundred people in a year it's really hard and thinking about culture for me is just almost overhead and what I've realized is that at any pace even bootstrappers in our community when they hit about 15 employees or 20 if you're not very deliberate about your culture it can take a turn on you so you have to be in control of it so you know when we got there again we were 10 people and we were tighten it and I reckon I had hired really carefully and there were 150 people at at leadpages and there were just a handful it was just a few people that were that came in from a different background or a different you know corporate environment and they weren't bad people but they were just political enough or just not toxic is too strong a word but just a little bit different that it like gummed up the works and so even having five people out of 150 who are kind of gumming things up and really wreak havoc and you know so the answer to this of course is to you know have mission statements and vision statements and and goals and you know all the objectives and all the stuff and you can go generate giulio and just by clicking a button on a mission statement generator I just googled mission statement generator there were some funny ones that came out of this or you can you can be more deliberate if you know if you want to do this because I believe when you hit 15 or 20 all of all of my friends who run businesses this happens you can do something Netflix has a really good one I think co-authored by Patti McCord who has a book out and it's one of the more the better examples I've seen of this or you can even do you know you don't have to go this far if you're gonna try to solve this and you can go to balsamic and Pell D who's a friend of microcon friend of mine he just has the balsamic mantras and you know they're pretty pretty cool help our customers genuinely care about be good servant leaders I think balsamics over 30 people now and he just said man if I didn't have this because I said but but you're a bootstrapper man he was he wanted to be a micro SV he wanted to be a solopreneur and there over 30 people and I said do you want to do you know the mantras and the you know the the mission statement and he said well not particularly but but I have to write because culture is hard and so that's that's another thing all right last couple the fourth thing that I realized is that you have to hire for skill both skill and personality because if you hire just for skill then you do get folks in who are not a good fit for the company they can be toxic or they can just have you know personalities are not gonna fit and if you hire just for personality and you have to train everybody up then you can't move fast enough and yeah there were I'm gonna since we're over time I'm gonna add a little anecdote but I'm gonna skip it here to go a little short but this is something that I think yeah I hadn't hadn't realized and I think it you know you can impact your culture pretty easily and the fifth one is a bunch of stuff it's there's a bunch of other things I wasn't even around with that were I think kind of a pain in the butt the actual initial raising of the funding was kind of like an act you know being acquired it was a lot of due diligence it was a lot of work and I wasn't there for that so that'd be another tough thing to put up with if your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] meter is as low as mine is and when I say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I just mean I don't like dealing with crap that I don't want to do which is why I start my own companies you know the monthly reporting again asked Jason Heath about what that's like I'm sure it's a he never complains about it but I can just tell that's not fun their annual audits I don't know why they have to be out of it it's not IRS it's like an external auditor I think it's good for venture funded you have to you can tell it really dug into this stuff I just know what happens and I see auditors for weeks hanging out the legal complexities and a lot of other things so those are my five things that when I was inside you know the this type of company I realized those are real because we all have if you've never been inside one we have the myth of what it must be like to raise funding early they're gonna take control and they take the board and then they kick you out and it's like yeah maybe but these were the ones that I found that were you know we're actually real about that and so I feel a little bad about leaving leading with all the negative because it's like pandering to the audience I'm gonna come to my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off and talk about the negatives of raising funding but I am gonna talk about the good things here we're gonna finish up today I have seven things that are the good the good side of it things that I learned yeah from from a funded company and I think it's probably best summarized is like seven luxuries that funding affords you that I think a lot of us could potentially implement and our own businesses a few of them you kind of need at least a little bit of free cash flow to do but others you can just do from today so the first thing that I was shocked by and pleasantly surprised by when we arrived at leadpages is that they hire specialists and at one point I had a job description when we were three or four people when I said you know we need marketing help and customer success and we don't have a sales person someone to put out a job description that includes all of those and it was insane and I was naive enough to think that I could find someone and I actually did of course we found Anna but that was an exception hiring specialists is so much easier because people tend to be good at one thing and when you spread them across three disciplines like I tried to it leads to frustration and it leads to you kind of being okay and trying to juggle too many things so examples when we you know arrived at leadpages is they had someone this was like the best day ever because we were struggling with who should handle all these partnerships right it's called business of biz Davor business business development but Anna and I kept passing them back and forth and we were trying to figure out who handles us because it's like project management takes a long time it's dependent on external resources and we built 35 between 35 and 40 integrations over the course of about 18 months and we wanted to do just like Justin talked about this morning with the integration marketing is is is what I call that where you're just integrating and marketing on it so there's a lot of work to it and sure enough we got to to leadpages and I think there were two people like full-time working on this and I was able to just hand it all off and it was like it was really a good day so specialization and partnerships is something that if I were to do this again early on I know I couldn't afford someone full-time but I would look for a part-timer or a contractor or somebody who knows how to do this that could just run that show for us because it was a big distraction for me as a CEO of a small company and and you know for Anna who was again running three departments on her own or whatever HR like I knew that they were supposed to be HR departments but when we arrived there were five like five people in the HR department and I was thinking to myself that seems like a lot for this for this company but as it turns out it wasn't because they had two full-time recruiters in-house because when you're hiring 5,200 people in a year you need folks who are specialized in this and that was a godsend for me because so much of my time was spent recruiting people even though again we only hired 210 people over a couple years but it's incredible how time-consuming that is so the HR department had recruiters and they had a compliance person and they had the person in charge of you know of experience and all that stuff and again when I first got that was like what are these people doing and over time I realized oh if the CEO doesn't have ten jobs like I did you know the the marketing person isn't doing six different things like they actually are way more productive and and frankly a little more happy I think even got down to we everybody was a generalist developer there were three of us you know when we got acquired and today there are like 18 developers working on drip and so we're broken down and you know we have front-end folks we have front-end people just doing JavaScript then we have the UX design then we have the backend and it it is easier to find and easier to retain people and even like gdpr stuff back in the day I would have been struggling for months and and it was one of the reasons that I didn't enjoy a large parts of of running when not large parts but parts of running the company really sucked is because I didn't have someone who could help me out with stuff like this and today it's done by somebody the second thing that I wished I could have done and this is one that you know sometimes maybe you need a little more money to do it but when we got acquired I learned how I didn't really know what market salaries were it was always kind of like well let's like figure out a number I didn't realize there were things called salary surveys which are very experienced and specialized HR recruiters did know once we got acquired and so they were like do you realize all of you are way below market and I was like no I didn't know that how I've I did everyone sign up and they're like well cuz they love the company and they wanted you know to work with you and stuff but Derek and I like the founders we were all under markets and what that meant is we lost multiple two or three might even been four really solid candidates that I think could have moved ripp forward faster than we did there was a really good UX guy up in Washington State that we were bummed to lose but just didn't feel like I could afford it and in retrospect if I recall it was like a ten thousand dollar a year difference and I think to myself now how the hell did I let that happen and then there were a couple developers where we gotten discussions as well so the ability to pay market salaries is I think is game-changing and again this was a naive bootstrapper of like hey if I can wear bootstrap so if we can just pay less they all be fine but I think over over the years our people would have got would have got poached the third thing that I learned that I think that that you know leadpages did well is to hire senior talent so almost everyone we hired a trip was very junior and there was one was a cost issue where that was real or imagined by me it was definitely a very real thing and so most folks were junior and what that meant is you know we'd hi we hired a couple developers who were like I don't know three months and four months into being rails developers and so Derek had to train him up took a lot of his time by the time they're productive three four five months down the line now they're junior to mid and they're trying to produce but it meant we built features slower and so once you have a little bit of money hiring the senior talent makes you move so much faster and the fourth thing I referenced a little bit earlier I would never have considered this is to use a recruiter and an internal recruit or not a contingency external recruiter but I don't know if I could go back to hiring without someone who is handling that and after working with a couple folks inside the org who are like really not you know when you think of recruiter you're like oh come a pain in the ass they're linked inning me every two weeks asking if I want to switch jobs or whatever but I worked with like these really nice competent people and and our goal was to like just let's find the right people for the right fit and let's hire on skill and personality and they took away when we first got hired I was spending I didn't realize how much time in a week I was spending just trying to hire and Derick and I had really honed this process where we let high quality talent through and we you know it took a lot of time but it it was it was a good process and so I couldn't imagine anyone else like participating in that and again it was the naive kind of have to do everything founder mentality and the moment that I let that go it was about six or eight months after the acquisition half of my week freed up maybe 10 hours 10 to 15 hours of my week and we did not have false positives I think of all that we probably interviewed probably 67 maybe 70 engineers Derek and I and that was after a filter over the course of those two years and we don't have one person who came through who I felt like was a waste of time out of like 60 and I don't think we lost anybody that wouldn't have benefit you know so this is one that I just I went on upward because I was thinking you know I wouldn't have had budget to hire a recruiter right when you're 8 people and you're not hiring enough but I would just checked out like literally just typed in talent recruiter or something like that and I would this is what I would do you know if I were to start another one even though of course I'm not gonna do that so number five yeah I was guilty so I didn't grow I talked about this before like I grew up without a lot of money used to put batteries in the freezer to try to get more life out of him and rewind my cassette tapes with did anybody do that with the pen because I didn't have the batteries just me all right so figured everyone's yeah that's like cassette tape what are you talking about old guy so yeah I'm really cost-conscious with stuff and I think having had a few years where you know I was on the precipice of of maybe not being able to make payroll and that kind of stuff made me really really jittery and I remember combing through our a this is not our AWS bill but coming through the AWS bill every month and doing reserved instances to do the stuff and I was juggling and then like the boomerang I would boomerang an email back so that I remembered to do it and I know that I was saving a solid a couple thousand dollars a year or maybe five grand it like it just was not worth that time frankly and I thought as soon as I started thinking about this point of how much time I spent trying to save little dollar amounts I realized that that that amount took away focus from the rest of you know the rest of what we were trying to do and as a company with eight or ten people it needed that focus for me and so reminded me of a quote from Jason Cohen wpengine and a smart bear and he said no he actually got a like a listener question or a question from a reader and they said you know we're at 10 km RR and should we look at like optimizing for profit or should we grow grow our top-line and he said spending your time which is your most valuable asset on saving extra thousand dollars a month cannot today significantly improve your business you should be spending that time on getting more revenue both short-term verse and building systematic ways of growing revenue month over month and so obviously you can swing too far in one way or another right if you're a bootstrapping cash is tight you have to think about this stuff but there's an order of magnitude at which it doesn't matter and then there's a point at which it does so in retrospect I look back and I wonder wasted time question mark you know are these things wasted time I listen to a podcast the other day and someone was was kind of debating like should I go with Piarco because they're cheaper should I go with intercom even though they're probably you know perhaps a better tool I don't know if the differences in price between these but I don't know if it's even worth the time using Zoho which is really rough and I've tried it versus you know Gmail apps for Google Apps for the for the stuff which is expensive it's like five I think it's five bucks a month per user expensive definitely if you see my whole thing I can't control Wistia versus sprout video I wanted to sign up for whiskey I know members 100 bucks a month and we were probably doing 30 40 km RR and I was like mom sprout videos only 25 bucks a month and so we signed up for sprout video and then we had to migrate all that stuff like two years later right and I was like come on man GoDaddy hosting vs WP engine there's there's a laundry list so it was a reminder to me of like yeah there's certain things that that I think you shouldn't pay too much attention to second to last one is totally come outta nowhere but it's to use standard job titles so I used to just make up job titles and and when we realize man we need an architect or like somebody to like scale our infrastructure because we have to Sui send a hundred million emails in a month like we need a senior scaling architect and it was just off the top of our heads hey this makes sense so we're working at the recruiter internal recruiter and she says so I ran a salary survey for that and there's just not enough data and I was like yeah that's cuz we made up the name and she's like so how am I supposed to do this and so we're like well maybe it's a senior architect or something and she's a cool why don't we just call it that then because then the people who have their saved searches for senior architect it will pop up for them so not only can you not get good data when you make these things up I'm guilty of this obviously but you're not gonna you know people aren't going to know what it actually means like what does this mean this is there's no senior scaling architects at github or Google or Facebook and and it makes it harder for the recruiter to explain it when people apply for it they're like what exactly is this job this isn't doesn't fit in my hierarchy so titles matter and again as a bootstrapper I hate the titles matter because I don't listen to me this falls in the line of like just as Elissa [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't wanna worry about cuz I'm trying to build a product but it really does matter and there was another person who we were debating it was like should we i'm sure this person the the title of senior architect there was a whole long story around it i won't go into but a chief architect yeah we realized we had good advice from advisor who said coz to me I was like yep like he's super senior more senior than everybody else and the advisor said you know what if you give him chief architect there is no other chief architect what if you want to hire someone of his caliber you know what for you 10x in the next couple years drip 10x s which is the goal right you can't hire another chief architects so what do you do then and so it's thinking about how and we found a yeah kind of a compromise with a different a different title that worked out so it really made me realize like man you can't early on hire your first developer and they're working and be like well this is my CTO because if you get big like you may not want that Vella developer to be your CTO so like be mindful of of titles and then yeah that that was actually my example there it was there was actually a startup that I knew who named their first customers success person who was not a manager they named him head of customer success and then when they went and hired other customer success people they actually didn't want him managing them because he didn't know it and so they were now stuck of like do we demote this guy and potentially have him leave and so it's the mistake of like elevating titles too early to kind of make herself feel better seventh and last one is I feel like funding has the possibility of maybe you know making you less stress I do know that once we got into that world and I had the the funding to back us up and I had help in terms of recruiters and people helping us market and people running the finances and people handling legal and people you know specializing all these things I was a hell of a lot less stressed and so I somewhere in my in my dream world I feel like you know having a small you don't need a raise venture but having small amount of funding I think could be interesting and so I asked a couple people just it's three three founders that I know that I've actually invested in and so none of these founders that have raised venture funding it's all just been an angel round and in fact most of them are thinking about just sticking with their angel and getting to profitability with that and so I said you know Jordan gala we'll hear from him tomorrow closing us out he runs card hook and I said do you think the fact that you raised you know this this angel round made you more is as you more or less stressed at this point and he says I don't think about it in terms of more or less stress I think about it as having made this version of the journey possible because they're great they're growing very quickly way faster than they could without funding overall I'm personally very happy with the decision when someone asked me if they should take investment my answer is always to make sure they understand the trade-offs and to make sure that aligns with that they actually want and he had a very well-written long email that I can't include here but he had a lot of kind of pros and cons and he's like but if you accept that the cons are there like he's happy with it Matt Goldman with churn Buster and radio rocketship FM he says I feel more stressed by raising the funding but in a good way it's nice to have outside pressure we've been careful to raise from folks who are on the same page with our plans or girth plans so the pressure we feel is towards reaching a realistic goal so there's something about accountability there and and all of these guys send me a monthly email and we talk about stuff and I'm not busting their chops like a board they don't have board that none of them have lost lost control of their company none of them have people breathing down their neck but they are getting it you know unlimited free advice from from everyone who's invested in him including me and then Justin McGill who couldn't make it this year but he's been a mini micro comps he's with lead fuse he he's the reason there's a big question mark on this one he says it's been more stressful and that's with awesome hands off investors like you it's a mental thing for me as I feel an obligation to you guys when things inevitably don't go as planned it's crazy stressful thinking about how to share the news and that's knowing no one has any problem or is upset so if you feel yeah you know it's interesting to see the three different takes on not even venture funding right very different what these guys have done so I think there's a possibility I feel like perhaps I would I would feel less stressed so what can you do yeah I'm kind of in my wrap wrap up mode here I'm not saying you should raise funding in any way shape or form I'm saying these are things I think we can learn from it so you can what you could do is you can continue bootstrapping and that's what Michael camps about that's what I did for you know 16 years and just take as many of the seven that I that you can implement and hopefully learn from that and implement a meme in your business you could consider VC funding which I just don't think it's that fit for probably almost anyone in here where there's this third option which is called fund strapping and it's that in-between of raising around and never raising again and it's interesting because it's this I'm starting to see this kind of theme this is how these these kind of themes emerged in the startup space you know in 2009 business the software I I did a talk about split testing and I got a bunch of reviews and emails that said we don't do split testing that's for shifty internet marketers and we don't do that in the startup space it literally was not being done and then you saw the trend towards that now we do it and we like it and if you're not being shifty it's cool dude I was intended to talk about email marketing and I said my marketing is this great thing it's not dead everyone was saying email was dead and I got same comments and the tweets and stuff that said poet emails for spammers and blah blah blah and then you know what lo and behold it's like I think what we do because I was seeing it in our community and what I was doing in what we were doing is that the leading indicator and I think this is another there's a few other trends but I feel like fun strapping is potentially a fit for some people maybe it's one in 20 in this room you know and maybe it's one in ten but I do believe that this is gonna be become more of a thing this is on like non software businesses have to do it if you start a restaurant or a car wash you can't just start it up without a couple hundred grand right and so you you know you need to have a little bit of money and you're never gonna raise venture funding so the term was coined by Colin from customer do he says fun strap errs we raised an initial money but going forward will grow on the revenue of the business and there's an entire fund in DVC and I like the way he describes it Bryce he says there's no implied series-a so it's it's an interesting thing on the typical VC funded path obviously is your seed round and then your series ABC etc and once you've reeds that reach that series a man that's where all the bad that I just talked about happens right that's where you're pushed for growth that's where you have a board that's where you could potentially you really need that be in the sea in every 18 months you're raising funding but the fund strapping path if it's something that is at all interesting I'm guessing it's it's not for the majority of you and maybe not even a fit but if it is you want a bootstrap that sucker just like all of us right you get up to 20 or 30 K so the Evan s valuation and you raise that single round and then there's a ton of hard work and then profit for everybody so that's it for me today I look forward your questions so I have a copy of the entrepreneurs guide to keeping your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] together that was a co-authored by Rob and Sherri walling together so freeze question you get a copy of the book and I was open for questions you talked about a little bit about your hiring process that you had the merger acquisition yeah can you speak the lipid on yeah it's probably longer than I could do verbally here basically we wrote a very opinionated and and real you know how a Patrick Collison said speak like a human like when you if you go back and read our job description it's it's like a well it's like a non abduction sales letter it starts off and it says you're you're a fantastic developer and the world is your oyster you can work for anyone so why would you know it's like you you you you you that's like the first four paragraphs and then it's like here's why you should come work for us because if you work for an agency you're doing other people you don't and so it starts with that and that instantly either filters out or gets people super stoked and then once we got past that then we would obviously filter resumes and then I would do a phone interview and we do some other stuff but we were it started with having a kind of an interesting filter at this front and then being very picky on the backend and turning down a lot of candidates thanks for the question yeah with fun strapping o with venture-backed funding every VC wants an exit that's a big part of what they're doing is they want to get their money out right with your approach on the Investor side or what you've seen on the fund strapping side or a model where the exit is less of an issue and you're just you know they're just taking the monthly or yearly dividend yeah yeah it's both I think that the interesting thing about the fun strap businesses that I'm in as a couple of them I think MIT have real potential to be acquired which would be the exit and the a couple of the other ones I mentioned were LLC's when I was talking to Patrick and they do plan the reason they set up as LLC is they want to be able to withdraw distributions and they want to reach profitability like a real business you know like am I would I consider a Microsoft business they want to throw up 20 30 40 K a month just in pure profit after salaries are paid and if you own a few percent of that you know you you make back your money and get it back so yeah again this is a model that you know is used in in restaurants and and car washes and that kind of stuff and so those are the two paths I think obviously they're not gonna IPO you know if you know if you don't raise around hey there's one thing I was interested in is I think a lot of people here they like having control over their own destiny and obviously you went into a company and you are now reporting to a CEO and things like that and I see it wasn't on your list of negatives so I guess where did you land on that in terms of you know going from where you were calling the shots on everything yeah where you were yeah answering to a board and all of that stuff sure that was that's a good question actually so the good news is I didn't answer directly to the board because they they're not really gonna hold a VP you know account I mean they would but really it's the CEO who would hold me accountable and I had the luxury slash Derek and I had enough inbound interest to acquire us that we got to handpick kind of who acquired us in a way and so clay Collins I've known him for a few years he was the CEO for the really kind of the first year and then the CEO Oh took over for the next year and I got along really well with both of them and so it could have been a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] show and I have talked to founders where it was a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] catastrophe and one guy told me I was on the phone with him and if it's the kind of the company name you would know it and they got acquired and he said just he said if you're gonna you're gonna you know work for him for whatever a year or two years or whatever he said consider it jail time just like could you go to jail for that amount of money and I was like I'm not sure I can do that and luckily it was not I mean it wasn't like that I kind of been missing the office already so yeah I didn't have I didn't struggle with it but I also wasn't or they weren't saying like build this and you know you're behind on say you know no one did that so that that would have been really hard if it had turned into that hi so when looking at your list of bad things about being vc-backed it sounds like some of them are really just challenges that occur at scale so things like communication is hard culture is hard those are things that are gonna hit you inevitably at a certain size business but you're kind of calling them out as problems of VC thoughts on that yeah I think that they're exacerbated substantially with VC BEC because you have to get there so fast so if I were able to grow you know let stuck base camp right 6070 employees like it's a it's a company so it's substantial but they've grown over 1012 years so culture I would say is not actually that hard to build over 10 years if you hire four people a year you know where six people a year or something I think it's much easier but if you need to go from 50 to 150 in 12 months culture and communication they become very hard because you're moving so much faster so that's that's kind of what I was saying is yes you're right they do exist at any company of any size but I think it's it's exacerbated by the fact that there's this push for fast growth and fast hiring you mentioned that culture can change very quickly do you've any other advice on how to prevent culture for changing ways to protect it things like that yeah that I mean the two ways that I know about and have experienced number one is have writing something down you know like the pel DS mantras or you can look at padding the chord stuff that I linked or obviously there's there's some good Doc's out there on it and having something written down and handing it to everybody and saying like no this is what we do you know this is what we do here if you don't do that you can totally have a 15-person company or you can have a 30 person company it's just the culture will be kind of it'll define itself and you will lose control of it that's the number one and the number two thing is all about hiring and it's about hiring people who are either on board with that or who you think you can get on board with that vision because different people do you don't have to four goals and it's it's not that there that's how I was trying to say it's not that there were bad people you know who flame out it's that they're just the people at the wrong company because there's another company that would be a fit for them so I'd like to think about it did you as far as on the acquisition side did you did you learn anything on that front whether you trying different tactics that you hadn't tried or that they could afford you just weren't able to afford Oh customer acquisition yeah yeah oh yeah yeah there was a lot because I mean leadpages is a marketing machine right it was started by a really really solid internet marketer so yeah they have I mean they they almost I don't know if they invented but they really perfected the affiliate webinar model they got crit just cross-sells were amazing cuz leadpages itself had 45,000 customers and they were able to send us a lot of trials per month they're paid acquisition again they had multiple people and that's all they did was paid acquisition instead of me checking the facebook ads once a week at 7 o'clock at night and trying to optimize them so it's standing and there was a lot of blogging there was content marketing there was SEO it's all the standard blocking and tackling that we would know about but it was doing two things one the marketing department was 35 people you know out of that 150 so was a lot of people were very specialized and they were tracking they had well they had a one or two guys who were just all they did was like try to track results of all the stuff you know it wasn't an afterthought of like we're gonna do this and see if revenue goes up it's like they could tell from the its initial Facebook ad they could see the retargeting they could see Boom Boom Boom Boom's sign up and then they can see how many months they stuck around and that was a lot of work right but they had two full-time people just doing that so I learned that you know what I learned is that I've always thought man I'm a Davina's developer previously so I'm a developer who's like I'm pretty good at marketing too like I'm a developer who's like kind of you don't you don't say I'm like I'm not a professional marketer period so that's that was a humbling humbling experience for me any others yeah hi Rob first of all congratulations on your retirement I don't know of anyone who deserves it more secondly you made a transition from being a maker to a manager yeah did you try to hang on to be a maker for too long at any stage and on what stage do you need to sort of go full-time into a manager I think that I maybe should have done it when before the acquisition and I think the fact that I was still so involved in the product caused me a lot of stress and pushed me towards a burnout that I only realized in retrospect and if I hadn't made that choice which I didn't right cuz I just loved building the product and just hanging you know hanging out with Derek and the team and doing stuff I eventually transitioned away from it when I mean when I left there were 18 people you know directly or indirectly reporting to me it's the entire product org and I did have to leave product about probably a year in and it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be in all honesty it was nice to take a break from it because it was you know it was stressful trying to do all the things and you have to at some point make a choice to let let things go let's dress you out so excited to be asking Rob a question as a micro preneur what what would be the benefit to fun strapping over getting a loan at the bank yeah well I mean I think you know again if you really are if you want to be a solopreneur like start the company and get it to 10k a month and let me know or 20k and live a great life like I wouldn't consider fine strapping if you're not gonna build something that is going to grow it does have to grow fast and it has to grow you know big and so there are the reason I even bring this up is that at micro conf there are people who just want an awesome lifestyle business and have a business that's doing two three four hundred K a year and and that's great I've been there and it's awesome I did that for several years and then eventually I wanted something more and so there they're also some folks here who are who are doing those larger things and that's where I think huh fun strapping would have made life quite a bit easier I didn't answer your question sorry what was the question again I would just talk it compared to a loan at the bank well so the fun strapping is is an investment in the business and if the business tanks you don't owe the money back they're buying equity or we are buying equity right when someone writes you a check so a loan at the bank comes with you know it hangs onto your personal credit and you know you'd have to pay it back or declare bankruptcy or something now there are other options there's a sponsor of microcon called as long yeah no capital sure Smith company or not Mike Mike's in charge of sponsorships yes yep Big Foot capital thank you which is it which talks about them specializes in SAS apps and funds based on you know m RR and stuff so I mean that would still be alone but it is an option where you don't have to give up any you know any equity so and they specially like also trying to get a loan from a bank when you're a SAS company they you don't it's it's like well what's your profit and it's like well we're not profitable because we're growing it so they won't give you a loan or as Bigfoot's like well you're at you're not profitable but you're 100 km are are going ten percent month-over-month we know that you could be profitable if you turn the spigot you know so there's a couple companies in the space but we think a big foot for being here if I fund strapped how much of my business am I gonna have to get up yet so it depends on a valuation and that's where I was saying you know if you were to even consider it which again you know certainly don't have to I'm not saying you should but I would bootstrap it to that 2030 k mark because then you can start talking about well I'm gonna I'm gonna ask for a three or four million dollar valuation you know or if I'm going to bootstrap this thing 240km are like in that range you can get for four to six million so then I'm gonna sell 10% of my company for five hundred grand right I mean that's that's not an uncommon that's the range that I'm saying it this summer as low as two depending on you know someone's really low and the top and actually top end I've seen I think is maybe around five million and so you know if you think about you get that chunk of money and you can put in the bank and help be less stressed you know that's exactly one more question there's a lot of the same lines up with the other xxx yeah yep Patrick Patrick asks that question or a similar question and it would either be getting acquired and if you're growing quickly that's always you know an option or to the point once you growing companies are not typically that profitable but once you get to the point where you're not growing anymore so let's say get that several million in ARR SAS businesses are amazing I mean they have top line you know gross profit margins of 7080 percent if you're not hiring and they have they can have net profit margins of 5060 percent you know I mean really high I amount some money amounts of eBay da coming in and that allows you to just pay dividends in essence so those are kind of the two paths it would be an exit or paying dividends like a normal normal company that you buy stock in thank you very much about the [Applause] you
