[Music] [Applause] hey everyone so I'm Thomas from F International like Mike said today I'm gonna be talking about some lessons I've learned from completing hundreds of millions of dollars in in deals so if there's one thing that's true for every single person in this room who's running a business it's that one day you're gonna leave your business and there's lots of different ways you can leave or exit your business but my hope is that anyone in this room who owns a business will one day have a successful exit and one of the metrics we we kind of look at internally and figure out if we've done a really good job is if someone can end up on the 2% of people on the pre micro comp survey that says they're now essentially retired I think Rob's walking around with unemployed on his batch which is a four for us I think probably one of the only industries where a previous client becoming unemployed there's actually a good result so just a little bit brief introduction about me I founded F international in 2010 since then we've completed nearly 600 deals in total that's into the hundreds of millions of transactions completed we have three offices one in Boston one in London and one in Singapore we currently have around thirty-five people working for us and we're hiring for about fifteen more so we spend a huge amount of time working with people before they want to sell their business so we're not in there the industry of kind of hard selling we want to work with people who are in a profitable business like many of you in this room who will one day thinking about selling so the vast majority of people we speak to the first conversation we have might be two three four maybe even five years before they eventually sell one of the reasons we invest a lot of time in it in this process is there a lot of different things you can do well in advance of thinking about selling a business there will massively increase your success rate when it does come time to sow so again another one of the metrics we track internally is our success rate a traditional M&amp;A firm will have somewhere in the region of a 20 percent success rate for businesses they take on for us it's over ninety four percent so ninety four point one percent of businesses we take on will sell and that's because we spend a lot of time at events like they're speaking on stage writing content talking to people who are in businesses and profitable businesses and helping them position it correctly so when they do want to sell they can have a profitable outcome so one of the first lessons I've learned and I've put this talk together specifically for people that growth so I'm working into the assumption you already have a businesses off the ground so you've already made the the first risk which is effectively launching a business in the first place and there's a lot of people a lot of entrepreneurs out there or people who want to be entrepreneurs who never take that first step so for all of you here you've already done that you've already done the hard part one thing I've noticed and I think this is common with particularly people at micro comps a lot of very smart people in the room but if there's one thing I've noticed over the years is that a lot of people tend to be very risk-averse they don't like taking risks in their business one thing I found one of the reasons I feel like we've grown successfully every single year for eight years it's because we try new things and we fail doing things and I would say the new things we try probably 80% of them them fail and that's not necessarily a problem if you want to keep your business moving forward the most successful businesses we've seen have tried lots and lots and lots of different things and lots of things have failed but some will work and the main thing is making sure you actually measure the results of whatever you've tested if you just test a bunch of things and then you just continue is the one that worked well or you thought was a good idea you're never really going to grow your business sustainably in the in the long run particular when you're speaking with buyers because if someone's gonna buy your business they want a bit of prove anything you're gonna say and that's one of the key parts of due diligence it's kind of verifying any claim you've made so if you say oh I ran this amazing new marketing campaign and then my customer numbers doubled they need to better prove that and you need to better measure that and I think the other thing is as well you don't need to make crazy crazy arrests and tried new wonderful things that have never been seen before in your industry you can make incremental wrists and tests you can find things they're already working and you can test new things you don't necessarily have to for example if you're gonna test pricing you can test a new pricing model without increasing your prices across your whole platform not grandfathering everyone and just overnight doubling everyone's price the ways you can do that in a more intelligent way which is incremental so just a small group you can measure the success of that so a lot of the businesses we work with that are successful and are successfully sold will be consistently taking risks which is absolutely fine and you should find your failing more often than not and I say if you're not failing that often you're probably not trying hard enough and you're probably not actually taking risks what you're probably doing is just making gradual and small improvements which we testing things things should not work and that's fine because you figure out then a good lesson is figuring out what doesn't work just as well as finding out what does so this is saying again this once you have a business is off the ground creating sustainable operational efficiencies it is really important because chances are once you're off the ground you might have hired your first employee you might have 10 you might have a hundred you might have a thousand as you hire more people and scale it's important to figure out operationally what's working well what's not working well and then put processes in place to improve that it may well be that we have a customer service role within your company and the same issues or client problems come up over and over again what a lot of businesses will do they will just hire more people and they'll say well we have we used to have a hundred tickets today we now have 200 tickets a day so we're going to double that will double the number of people we have but you can put things in place operationally to make it more efficient so you could build out a like a Help Center you could write more videos lots of different things you can you can try and put in place to make your business more operationally efficient and the reason this is important when it comes to eventually selling your business if that's thing you want they want to do its chances are that's gonna make your business more profitable which is always a a good metric it's always gonna drive a a strong evaluation than a less profitable business so wherever you are in your business I definitely encourage you to look at the processes you have write them down maybe take some small risk test some new test some new things but these are the kind of things that our buyer will look for particular if they're investing 1 5 10 20 million dollars in your business they want to understand if you already have efficient processes in place yes there are lots of buyers that will come in and want to make fixes in your business and make improvements but if you want to get a premium then if you've already got these things in place then you're gonna be a much better shape so it get asked a lot of questions about one of the most important metrics there's lots of good tools out there I know we've got Josh here from Bayer metrics lots of tools out here that will help you analyze your different important metrics in your business if you look in the VC world of SAS one of their the main metrics Dell says the most important is your CAC to LTV ratio what I found with the vast majority majority of people who sell fund their businesses is the primary source of new customers is word-of-mouth and what mouths generally has a CAC of zero there's no acquisition cost to acquire a customer from word of mouth but it was actually quite difficult to scale those businesses if your main channel is referrals so we don't actually look at that as the most important ratio because the answer is usually your cash is zero so it's kind of irrelevant that probably the most important metric and particularly this is really becomes important once you get beyond about $10,000 in MRRR is your revenue churn so there's revenue churn customer churn I really encourage you almost all of you to completely ignore customer churn and just focus on revenue churn because there are a lot of things you can do if you have say three different price points you have a low price a middle price and a higher price there are some things you can do in your product maybe when you're taking some incremental risks or or testing new things there are things you can do them I really annoy the smaller and the lower price cohorts and they might leave your product so your customer churn could be really quite high but what it that same thing you might have done might encourage more people to upgrade their plan and we found that in almost any SAS business taking the focus away from the kind of looking every customers if they're the same and focusing on the the cohorts that are paying you the most is really important and that's one of those things that can really drive down revenue churn so I'd say one of the other key things there is to listen to your customers and almost every single person in this room every single business owner listens to their customers but it's very easy to listen to just the vocal customers just the ones who say oh this was great or oh this is terrible it's very easy to kind of get particularly for your developer to just have feature creep where someone asks you a question hey can you build this and you just build it hey I want this feature so you just build that feature as you grow it's really important to focus on the things that are actually gonna drive your revenue forward not just keeping the particularly the lower-paying cohorts not just keeping them happy keeping your higher-priced customers happy and that's a little really long-term reduce your revenue churn and as you scale into the 50 hundred 200 maybe even a million dollars in mor revenue churn becomes extremely important and the the main way you can really get there beyond kind of making improvements testing new things focusing on your bigger customers is is with your pricing a lot of or almost every SAS business out there doesn't do pricing very well and there's improvements they can make to pricing so say you'll have completely different products but if you can focus or build a pricing model that has expansion revenue built-in so the things the most successful businesses we see don't have so whatever you do don't have a unlimited plan have don't have an unlimited plan have a kind of tiered model where people could make more and more or pay you more and more on your platform and then final lesson is sell your business at the right time so many people come to us when their business has started to decline and then that's really not the right time to do it so while you're still growing think about these things well in advance so a lot of things I've spoken about even if you're thinking of selling in five years or you're not thinking of selling it to all put them in in place now so I think I'm pretty much out of time so if anyone has any questions I posted in the SLAPP channel but I'm gonna host a small dinner for people who might have questions about selling it's not gonna be any picture and I thought that if it's thing is thinking about doing in one year five years ten years then you can RSVP there or just grab me send me a message on slack send me a message I'll be here until Thursday so I'm happy to answer any questions you have thank you very much you
