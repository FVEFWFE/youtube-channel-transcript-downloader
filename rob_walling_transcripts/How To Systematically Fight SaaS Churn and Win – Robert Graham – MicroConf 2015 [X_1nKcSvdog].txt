[Music] [Applause] so my name is Robert Graham we're gonna talk about fighting churn and winning one thing I'd like to do first though because the the timer doesn't start til I advance the slide as uh is Rob and really everybody here I wouldn't be up on this stage and talking about business unless I had come to Mecca Kampf and I don't know if I have time for applause or anything but I just like to tell everybody in the community especially Rob Mike thanks so we're gonna jump in with $66,000 so I did a best-effort estimate I have some experience with businesses in micro Kampf this is what I think you're losing this year if your churn is worse than average instead of average or better this is an annualized number and it's a lot of money so we're gonna talk about how you can use decades of research because there are other businesses there's subscription-based and they've already done this research and how you can use that to look at churn in a new way something that I came up with called an activation map can help you identify where your turron problems are or you can call it a lot of things and then one really tricky way that the worst solution you find to a problem can appear to be the best solution we're gonna talk about how to fix that this is my favorite micro comp tradition by far these are my children again my name is Robert Graham I did two products and wildlife management some of you may know me as the white-tailed deer guy I wrote a book cold calling early customers helps engineers make cold calls and now we're can keep if I which helps businesses reduce their churn and first we're going to talk about what churn is just to get started so this could be a talk by itself but we're gonna go with simple churn so simple churn is just if you have a hundred customers in April any loose end of them you have 10% churn let's do an example to get a better sense of what this costs so if you had 500 users paying you $49 a month and you were growing at 12 percent month-over-month what does it look like if you have average churn or worse than average churn so there's no numbers on the graph except for 5 and 10% so the blue is five percent Sharon sorry the blue is 10 percent Sharon what your revenue looks like and the orange is if you were down at five percent and in the grand tradition of leading questions and slides how many of you think this is more than say $100,000 that it cost you just like one guy was a leading question oh man well you're alright it's eighty eight thousand dollars so but one thing that this number this $88,000 numbered ignores is is LTV and how much it cost you to acquire those customers so this is also something that can change your business that's not a direct loss if you have five percent churn then you're almost a thousand dollars in LTV per user whereas if you're a ten percent churn you're down at about 490 so how much you can spend to profitably acquire someone is vastly different if you bring your chart down and so we're going to focus on today to fix our turn problems its customer engagement this is both because I think it's underserved as the thing that you can do to reduce churn and because there's some excellent talks on some of these other subjects so the first thing to do with customer engagement is mindset a lot of people can come to different parts of online businesses just with a kind of a funnel mindset and there's one problem with that in churn and that's a lot of times churn represents someone's loss of faith and your business it's that they don't believe in you anymore and coming to them at that point isn't very productive so what we want to do is make those people successful when they get started and make sure that they stay successful when they're in your business this is me with my hands up this is my my picture this is the top of the Harding Icefield it's a trail near seward alaska it's really cool place you should go and what i noticed when we got up to the top there is that a lot of people were turning around within like 400 yards of seeing the ice field and it's a tough hike but if you get within 400 yards you might as well go to the top of that hill and see the ice field and i think if people had been there and known that hey this is how you you know you need walk in the snow or these are the shoes you should wear this is how cold it is up there you should bring some water that they would have been able to be successful in their journey so you just need a little help along the way and this is where they would get to so this is customer success this is helping people get where they want to go see what they want to see a really bad way to measure this is if they log into your application because logins don't represent any achievement logins in fact buffer found that 33% of their churn was actually active the day that they turned so it can be just a totally backward metric and this is where we get into research so all those companies your telco your cable company magazines periodicals they've done decades of research about how to analyze subscription revenue and how to keep people around and some of their current problems are a lot bigger than ours and this is how they do it recency of purchase frequency of purchase and activity and this frequency using ties in Willa Jessie said about about establishing habits you kind of want to establish a habit of a commercial relationship with someone and then the monetary value so what they're spending and the great thing about the RFM model for SAS businesses is that our data is much more rich than any of those other businesses so this is where we're gonna start measuring and this is what I call the activation map groove a lot of you may be familiar with groove they have a great blog and they reduced their churn with something really similar to this that they called red flag metrics by 71% so my example here is a drip and I think a lot of you are familiar with drip it's it's lightweight marketing automation that doesn't suck I believe and so on the right hand side is is basically what the drip onboarding process looks like so you want to track that you want to have a Vince that make sure people are getting on boarded and you want to use samuels ideas to help them get on board it and then you also want to track deeper things so things that not everyone is going to do but that you want people to do because it makes them more engaged with your application you want people to create split tests you want people to integrate with other services because it gives them more value and it gets them deeper so we're gonna measure this we're also gonna do another measurement and it's something like happiness but we're going to use the recency and frequency of our events to do it there's one caveat here I left off the onboarding events there's a reason I did that so later on in the customer life those go to zero because you don't get on boarded again you're already a customer but early on if you're looking at early chair and we'll talk about this you may want to address that early on and measure it a little differently the problem with these measurements comes in and it's something called Simpsons paradox some of you are probably already familiar with this it's something a lot of statistician statisticians know very well but it's super counterintuitive so so bear with me you see the blue line and the red line and they both have a positive trend right but these positive trend groups of data if you combine them and make one line to represent them it's the black dotted line and it's going down it's a negative trend line this is Simpsons paradox and I'll give you another example this is a kidney stone treatment this is on Wikipedia it's really famous example so in in treatment group a when you split it out and groups that had small kidney stones and large kidney stones treatment a is better for everybody right but when you combine them treatment B looks like it's the best solution so if you didn't look at this broken out into groups then you would be stuck with a lesser solution it would be worse for everyone so this is really important in medicine and it's also really important in your business and the thing that can save you from senseless paradox is really simple small stones and large stones this is called a confounding variable and you can solve it by having cohorts smart furniture actually increased their open rate on their emails by 311 percent by breaking people out from six cohorts to thirty so what types of cohorts do you want to use the first one is calendar so Rob spoke about early turn and that's really important you're 60 to 90 day turn is going to be vastly different from everything else depends a little bit on your business but that's where you are the other thing that's going to be different because we're all startups because we change really fast you want to attract people from month-to-month how are they doing what changed and so people in January have a different experience that people in February the next one and this is this is from bid sketch Rubens plans you want to look at value so what plan deliver that that how much are they spending and are they monthly or are they annual because I don't make a big difference in how they use the application actually the next cohort I like to do is an action based cohort telefónica Europe combine this with a little bit more fancy business intelligence but it's pretty much just actually cohorts and they were able to reduce their churn by something like wild amount and the idea is just to know you know if people are collecting addresses people are creating split tests what is that what are they otherwise likely to do what are they missing what can you encourage them to do where can you take them so how can we use all these measurements in all these cohorts we'll talk about a couple things we can do to actually get churned down so mention reduce their churn 22 percent overall by focusing on how you value people and using a lot of different communication channels these are a lot of options it actually doesn't matter to me if you want to use email I am or in-app stuff text messages there are a lot of options you can automate all of them and you might want to use more than one so let's do a couple of quick examples though I'm gonna stick with drip mostly because I just need something everyone's familiar with so if we have some information that tells us that people in drip using split tests and automation tasks are you getting twenty percent more emails so they're being more successful then we want to make sure that people are doing those things so we could create drip campaigns for new people that just tell them about hey these are the keys to getting started with split testing campaigns this is how you can collect more emails with web automation so this is a really cool thing to do and it'll take you a little further down the path and another thing you could do behavioral emails so triggering things and it doesn't necessarily have to be an email but it could be so if a user using split test hasn't created a test in a while send them some split test ideas if someone creates some automation tasks but then has just like fallen off or you know doesn't get started right or maybe just to help them get started give them a few pitfalls where should avoid how do they get going make sure that they get to that success they were looking for Experian everyone's favorite company they saw a 54% improvement in their turn by using triggered behavioral emails 54% is a lot for one technique so another idea is extended onboarding and this is where you steal all of Samuel's good ideas and you combine them with some of these later activities so you know that people say that create automation tasks do better than people that don't so you create some onboarding flow that's later on in the process that helps them get to that point now maybe not everybody does and maybe it's an opt-in thing maybe it's an optional thing but that sense of like progress and accomplishment and bringing people along it's super helpful because these are the people that are getting to that top of that mountain but not getting to see the icefield services this is another great place I think so Zendesk did personal outreach with email and phone calls and they reduce their turn a lot that way it's a good thing to do another great example is Brennan done so I think his products and training feedback into his products great he does freelance software for project management plan scope and then he has books and he has a newsletter that gives a lot of value to help people raise their rates and help people get more customers people with higher rates and more customers need more projects more project management so you want to have some of that synergy the last one I'll talk about is negative churn very quickly so this is when your upgrade revenue when you upsell people new services new products or just upgrading people to higher plans service when that's greater than your downgrades and your revenue churn you have actually get negative churn and this is this is kind of a graph that you're looking for the green one and that's something for when you stabilize your turn and you get mature so when I went up there to the Harding Icefield I didn't think that you could actually go on the ice but I saw people out in the ice I thought that was like environmentally you know not acceptable or just maybe crazy but I saw people on the ice and when I saw that that was possible I wanted to be out there I wanted to do it I want to go to the next level and to me that's customer engagement and and making customers successful you want to take them where they can get to and you want to make them successful so I did you know I installed a java application but after that I went to the Matanuska Glacier and I did some ice climbing and I think that's what what you want to do for your customers you want to get them to be successful with what they need right now and you want to show them what's possible so you can make them successful that's it thanks Robert you
