[Music] I'm glad to be able to chat with you a little bit about telling the developers it's a it's a topic that I feel passionate about because I loved working with developers I am a developer and I love making developers lives better and that's one of the things that I most enjoy about my current startup honeybadger is that I can actually spend my days making your days better so I love it and that's I'm excited to be able to talk to you about that so if you are a developer you probably recognize this guy if you don't recognize his picture you recognize his name this is Larry wall the inventor of the Perl programming language and many of us owe a lot of what we do to what he has done and I want to share with you this quote because a lot of us once we find this quote we identify with it and it kind of guides us as who we are and who we want to be the quote of course is that a great programmer is both as lazy impatient and has hubris so if you're looking from the outside in if you're not a developer you might look at this list of attributes you like I'm not so sure that's a great thing but if you have accepted this lifestyle if you embrace your develop earnest you realize over time that these characteristics and attributes are actually great so we're going to talk about how you can appeal to these three different characteristics of developers while you're trying to sell to them now first I wanted to spell admit that a lot of people have and that is developers don't buy things developers buy things all right so that's just a myth ok so we're going to talk about how we can take advantage of the fact that in fact they do buy things and how we can sell to them so first let's take a look at laziness if you're a developer and you have had the experience of having a new project or a new feature you may recall that one of the first things that you did is you thought about this project that this feature is you thought I wonder if someone has already done the work for me anybody had that experience of course we've all had that experience because we're all lazy and lazy in a good way laziness in this case is has someone done this work already for me has someone already invented this wheel do I really have to reinvent it or can I just plug in someone else's thing and just go you know hang on read it for the way that you can sell to this laziness attribute for developers is you have to be findable right so what happens is the developers like okay I've got this problem I need to validate zip codes all right let's just say I've got a client request yeah I got they're gonna type in a zip code and I want to make sure that that's a it's actual a valid zip code for they state the Internet right so you think okay how can I do this well I can go look up a chart of zip code somewhere or maybe I can call an API so you go for a dip code validator right easy as pie right this is not rocket science you need to be discoverable for that right so if you're thinking about what your product is that you want to sell to developers first they have to be able to find you but the way they find you of course is by you're selling your benefits to them we've heard many times that you should sell benefits not features but for developers the trick is once you get them once you hook them once they read your headline and they think okay this could work for me this might be something that I could use then you need to sell them on the features developers are not satisfied just with a list of benefits because anybody can make up a list of benefits I mean sure yeah of course you're gonna do everything I need you to do prove it and that's where all the features come in you need to show in exacting detail exactly how your solution solves the problem they have now my experience has been with honeybadger IO which is where we sell a monitoring service to Rails developers and also with rails kits calm where I sell ready-made code to Rails developers so my comments are informed from my experience selling to people on the open source stack and specifically Ruby people so some of these things may not apply if you're trying to sell like dotnet components I can't really help you with that but I can just tell you from my experience things that I run into many many many times selling to developers and some of the some of some of these tricks so your mileage may vary is basically a short way of saying that a developer wants to know is this thing that looks like it could solve my problem is it going to solve my problem and how can I find out and a little time as possible because I'm lazy this chart is a chart of my Wistia that's Wistia is a video hosting service my Wistia stats for the video that you can see if you go to rail skits comm and look at my recurring billing component that you can buy when I looked at this to get ready for this talk cuz I don't look at the stats very often I was frankly I was surprised because that video on that page is 6 minutes long that's a ridiculously long video I don't watch six-minute videos but this video it works and that's why it's there and that's why 6 minutes long what is in this six minute video what I do is I take the code as you would download it after you get it from you get a zip file you can open it up and so I take that as a customer and I open it up and that's X editor and I start walking through exactly the steps that you would take to use this the code that I just sold you that hopefully you're about to buy and I tell you exactly how you can use it you can see it and I can't see all of it obviously and it's like in this tiny little windows you can't just copy it it is open-source you get the full thing but you can see exactly how it is supposed to work and six minutes worth of that and this chart shows how much that video gets watch it's ridiculous 393 loads of people that loaded that section of the slide that had that video 97% play rate fifteen and a half hours of people watching this six-minute video 46 percent engagement that's pretty cool now I don't have 46 percent conversion on sales obviously but it shows you that developers want as much information as possible once they think that your solution might be an appropriate solution for them so what does that mean for you it could mean a six minute video where you show everything it could mean that you produce a heck of a lot of documentation if you're building like a developer component like rails kits you want to provide a lot of documentation down to the method level because I guarantee you developers want to know down to the method level what does this component look like what is a signature is this code really good and how can I tell that if I can't see it well the documentation is the next best proxy right if you're selling a service like honey badger you might find that the documentation that you can provide about every little feature on every little aspect of your application and through some developers question about will this work for me if you go to honey badger audio and you love the homepage and you ignore the headline which we need to improve and you scroll down a bit and you scroll down a bit and you scroll down a bit more and a bit more we just throw out a whole bunch of information that you wait on the consumer site would not be so great but in our case works really well bonus points you have all this content out there you're more discoverable so it's kind of a virtuously ok in patience developers at your site he's somewhat convinced that what you have is good for him or her how do isn't how does this person know for sure so I'll give you an example back to this API validation thing I'll talk about it a little bit because it's happened to me last week I had a client ask me for API validate a zip code validation and I went to look for an API so I went to Google and I said zip code validator and the first three results were USPS ok went to the website it's ridiculous I mean I could even find what I was looking for went back UPS what's number two click through there I've got a register to see what your API looks like not gonna do it backed up third result smarty streets comm click through there's a box on the home page type in your address here and we'll validate it click the button and it shows me the result that I want click below that and I see the API sold so I know within two minutes that this particular site has what I need and now it's just a matter of am I gonna buy it or not so common questions in this phase is how long is it going to take for me to try this I'm a busy person I've got things to do I don't even know if you're going to work for me yet I don't want to invest my afternoon and finding out I want to know right now and the number two thing is do I need to get permission and by that I mean this brings up in our case the credit card form on a sad sight there's a great podcast episode about that thirty minutes talking about just this very thing if you sign up for honey badger you'll see that we do not ask for a credit card upfront and that is a decision that we consciously made because we know that we are selling in many cases to a developer who is on a team he does not hold the credit card and the last thing we want to do is to have that developer back up and go to one of our competitors who has a free free service or a free trial or won't put that roadblock in his face so that for us the best thing for us to do to get people in as fast as possible is not to ask for that credit card upfront it may not be that for your case but that's it just goes to is this going to work for me how can I find out with as little effort as possible hubris and this is where I think a lot of people got caught up on the 33 virtues because we don't usually think hubris is a great thing but in fact as entrepreneurs and developers hubris is what allows us to actually take that leap I know what I can build that better I can solve this problem I can actually do that and developers have plenty of this because in front of them is a world full of problems and they got the hammer when a developer is looking at your site and he's thinking wow I could spend in case of rails gets $250 or I could just build this myself it's not complicated I'll just build them myself and so they ask themselves how long would it take for me to build this myself I bet I could just throw that out there in a weekend I mean we've all thought this all right I'll developers think this I guarantee it what you need to do is convince that developer that surprised your time is actually worth money now I don't know what the deal is with developers but I will guarantee you that just about every developer ever has at one point valued his time at almost zero if not zero and many developers out there right now still continue to value their time at zero I'm gonna spend twenty fifty bucks no I don't think so I'm gonna spend two weeks building my own and that's just lunacy when you think about it from an economic standpoint but developers aren't economists so there you go so we need to do is come that developer you know what this $250 is chump change compared to the two weeks or three weeks or four weeks that you might spend trying to solve the same problem and then they're like oh okay I'll buy that so when you're thinking about how do I convince some developer after you show enough of my site to actually plunk down the change remember that person is probably valuing their time a lot less than they should so you need to educate them on number one their time is worth some money and number two they're under estimating how much time you spent on it because you've packaged it up nicely they have no idea how many nights weekends and months you spent and they have the skewed perspective and so you need to convince them by the way this is going to take you a month don't bother just give me the money so if you remember these three things the laziness the impatience and the hubris of all great and not so great developers you'll be able to target their psychology perfectly to be able to sell to them my slides are there if you want to look up some more resources some great talks from last year's bacon Bismarck Andre talks about your sales page should just slay objections and that's great especially in this case with developers and also Sarah May at this year's Mountain West Ruby conference talked about how developers select open source packages to use in their own projects fantastic I'm looking at how developers look at this car thing so check those out it's it's there on the on the link you [Applause]
