[Music] [Applause] hi okay there we go is everyone good ready for some SEO yeah that good right so hello everyone my name is Dave and I'm in SEO because of that I view Google quite differently to most normal people but I get why most of you I'm guessing don't actually get around to doing SEO so I've got simple formula which is if you take something that's boring non-urgent time-consuming unlikely to work you throw in the adrenaline rush it it might actually blow up in your face and leave you worse than when you started what we're left with is something that's just never gonna happen right we all have enough things to do we're not looking for new ideas my goal for this talk little bit ambition a little bit ambitious is to eliminate all these reservations you might have about SEO so I'm going to make sure doesn't blow up in your face I guarantee it will work kind of it's going to be very time effective and because of this it's going to become more important it's going to work his way up your list of priorities so what we're left with is something that's effective quick and easy and you have to do it the boring bit there's nothing much I can do about and I believe tonight I've got 170 more slides to get through so the speed of delivery is going to be intense but the good news is you don't have to write a single thing now at the end of my talk I'm going to give you a URL that has all these strategies or the tips the step-by-step instructions a link to the tools I talked about everything so for now sit back and just enjoy the ride get so take on the principles more than the specifics so those of you who don't know me I'm Dave Collins hello from software promotions I have been doing SEO since 1997 I know I look young doing SEO since 1997 we worked with almost 600 businesses all over the world despite that so far at least in my mind I am not quite yet a dinosaur if you won't see what 20-plus years of SEO does to you this is what I look like when I started and this is a particularly good flattering picture of me today it takes its toll you can probably tell from the accident I am in fact British so this sort of image is of course terribly exciting true to microcon tradition I don't have people still do this but I'm going to do it my significant achievements in life are my two children astronaut Wayne who like many children of their age or slightly insane that's all the personal stuff let's get started so at some point I'm pretty sure almost everyone the room has heard someone saying that SEO is dead whether it's on a podcast you eat in a blog post someone's standing on the stage you've heard it before right so usually when someone says SEO is dead what they mean is they tried it and it didn't work or they never get around to doing it and sometimes it's just the people like making controversial statements I mean this is the area that truth is open to interpretation right the fact is when someone says that SEO is dead whatever the reason they're wrong it's that simple and you as business owners if you're going to believe it when people take the Tessio is dead it's potentially damaging dangerous advice it can actually hurt your business so this is something that people like to give as an example I search for places to visit in Vegas for ads at the top Google scraped information all over one organic listing at the bottom at least without scrolling down the page but that shows a almost an ignorance of what SEO is about because the aside from the ads all the lot of all the other information on the pages either organic or it's powered by organic search for get married in Vegas at lunch um it's either organic or it's powered by organic but the fact is they don't always get it right Google don't always get it right and this this is the real secret of SEO so for different conference a year or so ago I searched for where to buy Euros in Google getting information on exchange rates a link to your car parts which I still don't know what it is this is this is the real secret of SEO that actually Google don't always get it right and they actually they actually need our help and ultimately this machine the powers of Google organic listings it's a system and you of all people know that any system can be tweaked optimized stood a little bit and word your advantage and that's what I'm going to show today before that the fun stuff we need a little bit of background you need a very very short history of SEO which of course I've everyone's wildly enthusiastic at speaking a history lesson about such a dynamic topic as I see it right and I get micro comp I get what you're about I am part of you you want the actionable stuff right you don't want all the theory and I understand that but sometimes the foundations are really important sometimes the foundations are so important because everything else gets built up on top of them up to a point I'd even go I think I'd go as far as saying that the the theories that underpin the strategist I'm going to share with you are actually more important than the stretches them selves so back in 97 when I when I started my glorious career as an SEO there was a lot of text we all had vaping modems and connected at vey slow speeds so the web to all intents and purposes was text-based there were a few images they compress no audio no video no streaming all that was yet happen as the web grew there was a lot more text and then more text and then more text now John the talk I want to plant a few a threat three you think three different seeds that I'm going to plant with you ideas these are seeds the idea is you take these seeds you take these ideas and you put them somewhere dark and moist badly thought out you put the Sun you put the seeds somewhere where they will grow let's leave it to that I should it should rehearsed a little bit so here's here's the first to all intents were very used to Google we more or less worship Google we take them for granted a few generations ago people started using Google as a verb my children today they kind of know what Google is but they don't go to Google to find their information even though they do it's all through Chrome through the browser it's become a part of our online life so I had this idea can you imagine if we had to pay a small nominal amount for every search that we carried out say five times five cents 10 cents how happy would we be with the results that we actually got so I decided to run a few little experiments you've got to make SEO interesting somehow and what I did I did it in Google Images because it's visual it's a whole lot easier for me so starting with a one-level search I carried out a search for dog and in the 2530 pictures I can see there they're all dogs right then we modified search a little bit went for Jack Russell sure enough they're all Jack Russell Google are pretty good so far then we had a two-level search awaits Jack Russell smiling and for the most part Google kind of get it I'm not sure about the one right of center not sure how friendly a smile that is but for the most part they're there now at three levels it starts get a bit interesting I change it to black and white Jack Russell smiling so here we got a little issue with context because Google don't know am i searching for black and white picture of a Jack Russell smiling or a black and white Jack Russell that happens to be smiling and what's interesting for me is that when they start to lose when they start to lose their grasp it starts to slide pretty quickly and already we get a few things that are in there I'm no expert but that's no Jack Russell when we go to a four-level search google completely lose it so I change the search to black and white Jack Russell smiling next to a baby now it's almost like they have this this sphere this dome of their expertise and once you break through the barrier of the dome they really don't know what they're doing and most of these images fail to qualify you more than I'd say one or two of the criteria at the most and there's people we can see these images don't make sense the only two images that had anything remotely close to a baby were these two was a small boy and a pregnant woman which isn't close now this is the first idea to want to plant with you that sometimes when they go beyond their their dome of expertise they lose it a little bit and they need a little bit more help instead this great genius system it's a little bit more like a developing child complete with tantrums as an aside that's my Jack Russell lucky smiling Aaron who some of you know who I work with I love that picture cuz the love was flown from Aaron to the dog is just just fantastic okay that's my reminder to go faster so you know that great thing when you can drag an image onto Google and it shows you other signs that use this image that sort of things so I carried out an experiment using this image on the bottom right this is an image I use on my social media profiles most of them certainly Facebook LinkedIn Twitter and Google+ so I drag that image on to Google Images first thing Google tell me is best guess for this image Dave Collins well Wow they have a Google+ account belonging someone called Dave Collins and they have that precise image there's nothing amazing about that it's at the bottom where I think it starts get interesting when they go to visually similar images now these are not people that look like me but these are images that Google have decided whatever criteria they're using these are visually similar but a few of them started to jump out a little bit and as people we can see even with reasonable level of eyesight we can see that the image on the left really like the image on the right but a lot of it's about context and technically this is this is some pretty advanced stuff that Google are doing here but then I noticed something a little bit interesting to me at least these are the images to suppose to be visually similar to the image on the top left some of them started to look familiar earlier in the presentation I was going to have a different slide for who is Dave Collins and what I noticed is that four of these images at least four of them were in sync yeah for these images were actually shown as visually similar now these are images that Google don't know from the images is a person called Dave Collins this is information on the page is the page title is the alt tags the image titles all this sort of stuff so despite Google's claim of being visually similar it's all about text again it's a little bit of sleight of hand getting on that now I get this stuff is hard I do it's easy for me to stand on the stage and poker stick at Google and you could also argue no one's ever paid someone like me to optimize their content for black and white Jack Russells smiling next-door baby so far but this is Google and they're supposed to be able to figure this sort of stuff out and this just reinforces this idea that I keep coming across at Google sometimes need our help and for everything that's changed in the last 20 years or so the the actual principles of SEO the core fundamentals of SEO haven't actually changed at all and that's always been the Google need our help it is a two-way relationship even though it feels like we don't have a say which feels like we are the less powerful in the partnership it's a partnership Google invest a lot of time a lot of money resources into SEO they've got countless countless different resources they've got the search console I've no idea how big the dev team is but it's impressive they've got to start a guide they promote events they attend events they sponsor events but the flipside of hunger to a relationship with Google there's Google actually no it's a fair amount of stuff about us maybe a little bit more than you realizing and this is the second seed to plant somewhere this is second idea this is this is an under underestimated idea in in SEO I think and it's all about signals so imagine today or last night at the reception you meet someone for the first time rightly or wrongly you're going to base an initial impression based on what you see has someone holds themselves what they're wearing did they smell nice did they look clean if you hire an SEO and the first person for the interview comes in like that with a cigarette in his mouth and his thumbs up apologies if someone in the audience looks exactly like that but probably you're not going to have an overly favorable impression of that person if we go looking if you go looking for a website designer and you come across a page that looks like this you might not have my Rain Man tendencies so you might not spot this 1414 occurrences of the phrase website design but even if you don't even consciously pick up on the fact that it there is a lot of repetition it doesn't read right it doesn't sound right and you can bet the Google are looking for the self information as well if you have bland pointless statements like websites are becoming more common every day if you have copyright that has been updated in five years blog a blog that hasn't been updated in three years if you go to your search console and you have four million server errors 90 million not found errors how do you think Google are going to feel about that they're obviously not going to be remotely impressed signals is massively important and seriously underestimated okay as promised that's all the theory now we roll up our sleeves and now I'm going to show how to do this stuff quick reminder for me to get moving okay what I've got I've got two series the tasks that anyone can carry out and these are among the tasks SEO to us that I think deliver the best value really quick easy low-hanging fruit as you Americans like to say I think low-hanging fruit low-hanging fruit okay what I've done have got a series of tasks and underneath the tasks up sort of broken them down into a series of steps so first task is to fix the machine what I mean by this is your website might look great in the browser it looks beautiful and every time you look at it you get that little kind of like having a child that you only need to interact with through a browser and you get that's what swell of pride but if you pop the bonnet on your website and it's rusted away there's small details like the engine missing this is really bad it's really bad for users it's really bad for SEO fortunately Google make it really easy to find these problems and you can find them in the search console used to be webmaster tools but Google renamed it if you've used search console you know it's got the same it shares the same problem as analytics in that you get overloaded by information there's loads of stuff in there there's really easy to spend 10 20 minutes in there walk away with nothing so I've have shown you I wanna show you the the four most important parts of the search console that you need to be checking on a pretty regular basis again don't need to write it down it's all in the URL at the end these are the crawl errors HTML improvements index status and security issues crawl errors you get what this is about so I'm going to go to skim over this it's anything that Google find that causes a problem most common being a 404 if it's bad for Google in the SEO it's bad for visitors which is of course bad for you they give you all the details you click on it you find more information it's a great resource next we've got HTML improvements this this is massively underestimated see this text at the top addressing the following may help your science user experience and performance if you go to Google's SEO starter guide they define SEO as anything that has a note but that could have a notable impact on your site's user experience and performance so this is Google saying to you addressing the following you may help your site's SEO it absolutely ignore that at your peril then we've got the index status this is a real quick and easy one what you do is you select all the boxes and you make sure everything makes sense if you think whoa we've got about four thousand four thousand repay jizz Google or indexing almost four thousand basket if you look at the block by robots and say sixty should be four or five pages at the most find out why I find out what's being blocked so really quick and easy diagnostic security issue should always look like this currently we haven't detected in security issues if you have a part on your website that is infected by malware by spyware ransomware virus is whatever Google are going to pull you pretty quickly not punish you not penalize you because this is bad for their users so again this is this is the one part of your search console I think where if there's an issue there this is the only part these stop everything and fix it immediately really looking for anything that throws a spanner in the works okay second task is to invest the time in keywords don't switch off at this point don't check your email because we've all heared SEO at some point about keywords but they're really really important and they're really easy to overlook and vanish into the background somehow so here's a really simple approach let's say you wanted to optimize a page or a blog post on your website start with imagine how would your friend describe the page the caveat being we all have friends and friends so think about asking the right friend you could even ask one of your friends how would you actually describe it lucky friend second step once you've got this list of ideas phrases keywords run them through Google to make sure does this make sense would would we expect to see our content in this list or is it something completely different the third step is always to use tools not imagination a really common mistake is that people think they know their audience they get their customers and their potential customers so because of that they also get the language they're going to use when it comes to trying to find that product and they're wrong no matter how well you know them you're wrong you don't know what it is that they're searching for so I'm going to illustrate if the little example get people moving a little bit imagine you become part of the microcon fatigue and you go home and one of the first things you do is you're going to optimize microcon from the main page for one of the following phrases who would choose to optimize conference for startups quick show of hands okay very few entrepreneurial conference no one entrepreneur conference most of you are either asleep or you just hands on quite making it well what I did I ran these three terms through a tools that we'll look at later HS and what I find from there is that the monthly search volume entrepreneurial conference that no one would choose to optimize gets triple the volume of searches than entrepreneur conference and pretty much no one searching for conference for startups it's counterintuitive you can't guess these things unless you actually use a decent tool do the research so you know it's a trick right so here's another example imagine you decide you're so inspired by a CEO you can become an SEO when you get home be like me because that's a goal which of these keywords would you optimize this page on your website for who would choose to optimize it for SEO service to people SEO services what eight nine ten people SEO training it seems to be most SEO is dead how am i doing up here I flew over from the UK for this so I ran these keywords through the same tool and what we find is that SEO services gets around six times the volume of searches than SEO service which you kind of get while you're not searching for services but the point is the takeaway point is you have to use the tool you cannot think that you know the language of people are going to use for step once you got your keywords is to use them wisely so I carried out to search back in England for SEO service London now the the ads that are on the top I think that they're pretty good from the marketing point of view they've got great benefits are got UK digital HD the Year 12 years experience got pricing information specialists in SEO strategist ironically the organic listings underneath are awful the first one says SEO services London name of the agency and all the others are variations of SEO service London Pike SEO company London pipe SEO London that they're awful you have control up to a point how these how these listings appear appear with the page title and guess what happens when you have a title more compelling for people to click on them people click on them and laws Rand Fishkin from wells carried out experiments a go where he got people to carry out search and click on a link for their test page and sure enough it started to rise up in the rankings it's a click-through rate absolutely matters for SEO 2/3 tasks content I've got a slightly different approach to many people for content the first step is don't write new content I don't mean ever I mean don't write new content purely for the purposes of SEO it's more about for the most part it's more about making better use of what you have if you've got a very small and young website 10-15 pages or less you probably need to create content but most of us have got more content than we need it's just a matter of using them correctly using the right pages and again Google give us everything we need to find the right pages so go to search console go to search analytics what we're looking for inserting keywords will show clicks positions position and impressions and we're looking for keywords with a high number of impressions of mail Oh clicks now in their interface it's horrible so it makes a lot more sense to download it into Excel or whatever you use and then for instance in filter by greater than 250 impressions but very few clicks so these are these are real low-hanging fruit these are the phrases that you're showing up for probably got a low position they're relevant to what you're selling they're great opportunities second step if you absolutely have to create new content it's another seed this this is I think I think this is the most powerful technique and most people overlook this completely dismiss it as common sense so when most people go to Google we search for something and we search as a search and we literally look at it look at what's on the monitor as a person looking for the answers there's a different way of using it when it comes to SEO so imagine you've got a product makes no difference what the product is it could be a book it could be SAS it could be desktop software something to do we find what finding family trees so I'm going to go to Google and I'm going to carry out the search find my family tree but instead of looking at this information has a searcher we're going to just nudge it a little bit to the side tilt it and then we're going to step into these results looking at the same information through the eyes of an SEO so the first thing I'm interested in is that people also ask this is Google giving me more ideas so I did a search for find my family tree and they talk about how do I trace my family tree they're talking about ancestry these are great ideas obviously look at the site's themselves you don't need to reverse-engineer them but why they ranking for these phrases the search is related to at the bottom this is seriously useful if you can find one of those terms that fit in you can slot in seamlessly into your own content you've got your search term find my family tree and Google are giving new ideas for languages related to find my family tree so if you use both it's kind of reflecting Google's ideas back at them and it really really works obviously you also get the very basics idea you get some page type look at the titles in the actual listings to get some more ideas there's a scene in one of the Matrix films I can't remember which everyone knows this scene where for the first time neo sees the world not as we see the world but he sees it through the eyes of the matrix and he sees it as green data because that's what data looks like right actually it's like the back of the room right now I can think about it and this is the only part of SEO that's in any way related to a good sci-fi film but this this is extraordinarily powerful don't dismiss it as being obvious and common sense give it a go once you've got the ideas you run them through a dress you build your keyword list and so on you might think but why do I start what I've you've got no idea where to start for those seed phrases if you like if that's the case two ideas for you one is reddit there's a subreddit on every topic you can imagine and you go then you pick out ideas look at look at the language look at the themes look at the pain points of people are talking about join the weeb a few years ago from copy hackers and a story she shared this great technique Amazon mining a thing she calls it she finds a book related to the topic and then she quite systematically analyzes the reviews it's not the book itself it's the reviews and this means she stores this information and it's a way of getting into the heads into the mindsets of the people searching for what it is that she's trying to sell looking for the paying points the ideas the themes that common language points most importantly with keywords this is why I spent so much time talking about keywords if you run some like Adwords if you have an idea for a bunch of keywords set up by a campaign or in that group drop them in give it 48 hours you're done you'll find out should I explore this should I pull the plug SEO is different you could even spend in the reach of 15 hours creating new content five hours optimizing it two hours publicizing it you can wait nine months or longer and this is a really important a real important point you don't want to optimize for your keywords now invest all that time and 12 months from now go great we're in first place bad news two people a month search for this fourth task is to use the right tools and to use them correctly I had to put it that in because that hurts me every single time I see that so quickly flying through the tools I used to recommend COO keyword planner in AdWords because it's free and it's better than nothing I won't bore you with the details wide but they round up all the figures and from an SEO perspective is useless don't use it is actually quite misleading if you don't want to spend any money you got search console search console actually has more actionable data than almost all paid SEO tools it's it's a phenomenal resource my tool of se SEO know my tool of choice for SEO nowadays is a dress they no longer have a free trial but you can get a 7-day trial for seven dollars you can do a lot in seven days even if all you're gonna do is spend a couple of hours one afternoon hang out some keyword research it's phenomenal for number what you can find other tools we use screaming frog it's it's not overly cheap it's about two hundred dollars a year this is desktop based software for Windows and Mac it crawls the whole of your website sucks out all that information or your competitors websites sight bulb is a tool that most people aren't yet familiar with apart from SEO it's more expensive but you can pay for a monthly basis monthly licensed about $35 this is kind of like screaming from a better instead of sort of vomiting a tsunami of data it does more hand-holding and says this is an issue this is a problem this is an emergency if you really want to get your hands dirty you are a profiler we use this a lot for link orbiting content auditing semantic analysis all the real fun parts of SEO all these tools do ultimately give you a lot more hands however SEO tools don't do SEO for you and signing up for a whole load of SEO tools doesn't do any more SEO for you the only reason I say that is if your first step in starting SEO is to sign up for the next appSumo deal I think there is one today actually for an SEO tool it's a good deal but it's not going to do this work for you you have to invest a time fit toss is to feed the mobile index we're tight for time so I can't go into details there's a great change that started to enroll in Google what they're moving to mobile first indexing not mobile first index Google get very upset of that what it's about the hole of the index eventually is going to be based on the mobile version of your website probably and if you're not mobile friendly yet it's not too late but you really do want to stop moving on this they wrote about a blog post in November last year what they talked about this as an experiment March 26 they said that they wrote another post about that rolling out mobile first indexing true to form to Google it wasn't double speak it was quadruple speak and it's confusing and it's frustrating but you want you want to jump through these hoops it's it's a pretty important change that say it's probably the biggest change has happened in SEO my 20 years of doing it - final thoughts about mobile first is is it's not an afterthought now there's two common mistakes that I see one is people look at their analytics and they say well we only get 4% 5% of all traffic for mobile so we don't care about mobile you might only be getting four or five percent because your website is so horrible from a mobile point of view the Google aren't sending people your way the second point is of course they're moving to mobile first indexing this is something that has to be dealt with the other common mistake is to say our template is mobile friendly or your website designer swears it's mobile friendly it's responsive responsive and mobile friendly are two different things there's an overlap but not always Google have a mobile-friendly test that you drop in the URL and it basically hopefully you'll see a green thumbs up effect they say mobile spray mobile-friendly you see in the top left there's a page loading issues don't worry about that I ran Google through their mobile-friendly test and they fail on that score as well they also have a page speed insights it's not always not just a binary yes-or-no with mobile sometimes there's improvements that you can make that will have a big impact so you drop in a page a URL to the PageSpeed tool this URL is on the page I'm giving you the end and it gives you not not only a score but exact very specific advice for what I should do about these issues and how serious they are final bonus tip is to always always put humans before spiders what do I mean by that we've all we've all had the experience at some point that we go to Google carry out search click on the results and then we land there and think what what on earth is this about we've all had that experience right so I could decide after today that this has been so flattering for my ego that this is what I'm going to do I am going to be an SEO speaker so I'm going to go home I'm going to write a blog post about speak SEO speaker at conferences and events and I'm going to repeat it over and over again because that's how it works in the very highly unlikely event that even ranks what's going to happen when someone lands on the page like that they're going to bounce and as we know balancing is one of the worst signals that you can send to Google so to wrap it up the seven seven rules of SEO first rule of SEO is you don't talk about SEO I didn't think anyone would get that for you're too young so I'm gratified second rule veselija fix the machine it's not just about looking good it's got to work well behind the scenes third role rule invest time in keywords it's a really really effective way to get more traffic take a different approach content which is more use what you have rather than create new content use the right tools I have used almost every SEO tool that's out there almost and I'm more than happy to talk SEO tools to anyone who wants to hear that sort thing embrace mobile first I would urge you if you haven't already check your website later on the Google's mobile-friendly test if you see your past find me at the bar tonight buy me a drink and we'll toast your success if you fail buying your drink and we'll toast a great SEO opportunity that you've just discovered either way I'm going to win at least and always always put humans before spiders the final point these seeds that I chose such a terrible way to illustrate these seeds the idea of seeds most seeds in nature end up somewhere in the wrong place and they just wither up and they die nothing comes with them but every now and then every now and then a seed falls in the right place and really truly amazing things can happen and I honestly do believe this is the right place for these seats I think you are the type of people that are actually going to give this a go because you can pet your competition or go and celebrate if you don't it really works the only reason I still get excited about this year SEO this is me excited by the way the only reason I get excited about SEO is because it works it just carries on sending people to your website who want to buy what you have wrap it up with a picture of my dog lucky doing the best impression ever of the late great Freddie Mercury and as promised there is the URL with all the information you need thank you so that's where that bitly link went I was wondering who took it I've got mobile i3 it's 2025 for two questions awesome squatter oh I should have mentioned by the way on that page that URL there's never enough time for people to ask questions I tend to get a lot of emails afterwards I've I put a link on there we can actually book a call with me it's not a sales call you can just schedule some time and do get in u.s. friendly time so Dave unfriendly time so I'm going to be working little late than usual it's only for a week it's only for next week so if you have questions that we don't have time for today or you don't want to ask them in public just book a call would make over there when you go to book the call try to find the most inconvenient time in the UK I'm just so jet like that I wouldn't be sleeping anyway sorry whoa all right two questions so when content does you get a 404 what's the best way to signal to Google that that's no longer there do you redirect it do you put a 410 what's the best and and the second question is post our lightweight content should you not index those okay if you the first question sure about a page or a post that's no longer there you're just completely linden it like it's old or not relevant anymore I would either best-case scenarios redirected to the closest fit so if it's about I don't know how to do SEO you could redirect it towards something that talks about social media because SEO is dead as we know the second question what was the second question again it's like lightweight context so you have a blog post on release notes that's not really do you just not index that yeah if it's if it's what Google are fairly good at figuring out what to index and what's or not but they're not great and you have what's called a crawl budget they're not going to pay attention to everything you do so you don't want to waste that budget the way to do that by the way is and with robots.txt if you put in a URL or a whole folder a directory and robot start takes all that does is tell Google not to go there initially to crawl but if you've got a link on your website that's pointing to it they're going to crawl it's the only way to block it is to put a no index tag on the page all right helps I can't see anything yep thanks if we have one more question and then we will everyone else I see there's more than one hand up Dave is around for the next couple days so please grab it at lunch or in the evening hi there you mentioned about reusing content and news said something around going into the search console and finding things that have high impressions and low clicks but what was the exact tactic can you unpack that a little bit I didn't quite get it but I'm very interested so if you get a list of all the page we've got a lot of impressions very few clips probably it's because a low average position usually if that's the case this is a great opportunity oh if you thinking what what can we get we use this content better assuming the content is relevant you want Google to find it that's that's a page or that's a post that I think is worth time investing in in in actually doing the keyword research and carrying out some actual SEO right okay does that make sense yeah yep got it perfect thank you thank you you
