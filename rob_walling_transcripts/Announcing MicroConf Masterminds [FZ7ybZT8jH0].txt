hey there I'm Rob walling co-founder of micro comp I want to talk to you a bit about founder support and accountability I've been a longtime believer in the importance of accountability partners and a need for outside eyes on your business especially now having a founder or two to connect with on a regular basis about your wins your failures and what you're trying to achieve can make a huge difference in your success over the long term that's why I'm super excited to launch micro comm masterminds since the beginning micro comp has been about connecting founders to one another and we've talked about the value of masterminds in this community for years many successful founders I know have come to lean on their masterminds to sanity check decisions help with accountability and keep them motivated on this long journey of building and growing the startup if you've ever thought you'd like to join a mastermind but didn't know where to start that's why we're here our process is super simple there's a quick application that will ask you things like your location what stage you're in your teen size and revenue using those data points we've created a proprietary matching system to generate small groups of like-minded founders after we make our matches we'll send you an email intro and a QuickStart guide for getting up and running I've been in a few masterminds one of which has been running for about nine years much of the most valuable feedback and support I've received has been from those groups our enrollment process has only opened for two weeks so if this sounds interesting head over to micro Kampf masterminds calm
