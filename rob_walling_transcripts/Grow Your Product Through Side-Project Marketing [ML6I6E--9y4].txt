[Music] hey folks very nice to be here on the other side of the podium for once I'm gonna do a little crash course on a side project marketing than how to grow your product through it I'm from a little town called Amsterdam nice little kennels you know it I've been doing SAS for a long time already I started out h13 with my first label little hobby company was not really a SAS back then yet but started growing into that did to SAS companies between that sold them for time city of events tax as company at the moment and throughout all those companies all those years I had one problem which was common and which a lot of people in the room also recognized and that is growing a product is hard I mean a lot of people I talk to here say the same what I reach struggling with marketing finding my customers finding my first customers my 100 customers it's always the same and there's a lot of advice we get I mean not everybody has in Holland for SEO riding some blog posts generating leads through advertisements on Google or Facebook yes it's good to do all those things with a small team or a solo founder none of them really deliver the results you you want to get at least not for me so what I found to be very effective back in the days and also right now is ok let's get a few no sir between all those three things I just mentioned there's also the fact that the Americans are very saturated so when I'm doing SEO I'm battling against big VC funded companies who spend a lot of money on their on their marketing on the SEO on their clicks so it's not uncommon for my keywords to be fifty fifty dollars for click I mean that's not doable for small company besides that if we look at marketing for the value is very limited I was invited for a webinar a few weeks ago and it was a really cool subject I thought okay that's really gonna bring me value so I joined the webinar I enjoyed the first two three slides and then it was only about the course they were free so I was like okay not really my thing not not really bring me any value I was a bit disappointed so it was really about the company doing it there and not really about the end user so we got back to the basics for me as I said I just mentioned what's really worked is reciprocity like giving value and giving getting value back and if we look at the definition which psychological dictionaries say it's like the human need and tendency to want to give something back when something is received I think you can recognize that form for example if you go to a car dealership if you have a car dealer who is really giving you genuine and good advice and not just trying to sell you the most expensive car they are much more inclined to go to that dealer and buy your car they're the same for that webinar if I was just talking about if I got really value from that webinar I'm much more inclined to buy that product or at least to give it my attention so side-project marketing is actually about that reciprocity it's about giving a tell you it's about attracting leads for your main business by giving lots of value with a free small or big tool so I've been doing that in the past and that was really valuable for me there's a few examples I want again run through which give a good indication of this side-project marketing and one of them is well most well-known side projects is unsplash so in splash is a website where you can get free stock photos is run by crew and crew is a marketplace for creative freelance designers and their their customers so crew tried everything when they started the marketplace they wanted to get their there first created freelancers their first customers but they ran into the chicken in the egg problem like their platform was empty so they tried a lot of things and they ended up with three free months runway left and I thought okay we found a silver rule it's we're going to refresh our website okay that didn't really work out but what they did is they hired a lot of our they hide a few photographers who created amazing stock photos for them so they used two or three photos on their website but they had a load of new extra photos which I didn't didn't do anything with so I thought okay what can we do with those things they created a little landing page they put of all the free stock photos and they offered an offer out to your create a freelancer to end to everyone who wants to have those so that was their silver bullets their traffic increased immensely and what I did is they had one little link on the bottom of the sides to crew and even though not all the traffic was relevant it generated fifty percent of the revenue for the company and it made it into a million dollar company so amazing example if we look at another example its buffer probably well-known for every one year social media scheduling tool and what data it is they created a little bit more complex tool so they created Pablo and Pablo allows you to create social media images I think everybody knows the Gandhi quotes with the yoga backgrounds a lot of hard work goes into those things a lot of hours of photoshopping and what's buffered it they created a nice tool to easily create those images without any Photoshop so they put it out into the world got a lot of new users because of that because their tool is very own SEO and we're picked up by a lot of blogs and another example is a little tool which was mentioned this week by Patrick McKenzie patio eleven it's crontab guru and it's a bit of a technical tool and I'll explain a little bit about it but corinader that company behind it is a background processing monitoring service and server administrator administrators will recognize that but you have to set up cron jobs which are background tasks with a certain syntax and everybody is always forgetting the correct syntax so chrome tech guru allows you to easily generate the correct syntax and then use it within your server so what I did they set up a very simple script they put it online and actually because all the server administrators forgets all those syntax things the whole time their monthly traffic is crazy and the guys yes I think they're got the other guys the guys of transform mentioned that that this is actually one of their biggest traffic generator for their website well that's only it one day development scrit it's amazing so when looking at that those examples and also the the side projects I did in the past there's a few takeaways if you're setting up a side project for your company which I definitely recommend make sure it generates tons of value that we have in our we were talking about it's nice but just a promo tool there's no triggering of reciprocity from that webinar and also if you create the the 100th social media top 100 list of whatever social media tool that's just not providing that value make sure you generate that felly unsplash did that by providing this free stock photos I mean that's also because they were first in markets before that there were no free stock for the size and everybody was buying expensive photos in I just took a shorter stock for example and buffer created that online tool before there were any online image editors so both of them succeeded in that very well make sure you target the correct users I had a few people who I discuss a project with and they were very happy with their side projects but they were not targeting the correct users if you're doing your side project make sure that you have the correct persona that's your main products your main products which your one attracted leads for is relevant and your side project attracts the right customers so and flash actually attracted a lot of irrelevant users in yet there's the the teacher creating PowerPoint presentations for for their classrooms but there's the web designers there's also a lot of relevant Jews but since they weren't very went very viral and they had a lot of traffic they ended up getting a lot of revenue from it but if you're doing a site project with our small companies you can't expect to go viral so make sure to target us correct users besides that if you look at Tron Satguru it's a very easy product it was created in one day that development cycles not long it's also not possible to generate support tickets for crontab guru but imagine if you think of a side project which will do good in your branch if it's very complicated if your development cycle is multiple months if your support team is gonna be bogged down by support tickets from that product then that's not feasible to do as a side project so make it make the scope development wise limit it but also make sure that the product itself is mostly self-service and besides that I know what everybody here's thinking I was thinking the same okay so I can just fix my marketing by creating more products it's not built as a building they will come everybody knows that so your site project it can be an extra tool and it can fix your marketing problem but only if you also can market it so where for example buffer at a very saturated market and the social media is scheduling tools was very hard to compete on SEO for example on or on paid advertising there side project could make that part very easy or at least more attainable so your side project could be in a less saturated market you could maybe win on SEO on with your side projects or paid advertising and with that generate the leads for your main products so find a less saturated market or finds a unique angle for your side project compared to your main products and yes summarizing debts generate tons of value talking to correct users make sure that side project is not resource or operational operational limiting your business make sure you have that marketing angle for your distribution and then after that make sure you take down those mark that those Fizi fanatical ayats and if you have any side project ideas or I need any brainstorming around its just hit me up I'm on Twitter or whatever lens if you can email me if you are in the market for monitoring your SAS products check out bowls at
