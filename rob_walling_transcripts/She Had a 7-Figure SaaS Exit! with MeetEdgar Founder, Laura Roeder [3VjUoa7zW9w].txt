================================================================================

so I I I knew I would be able to sell it at some point to someone for some price but I didn't know if these would be the people if this would be the time so it it did feel like it was kind of a high pressure time and an exciting time too but also stressful just is this is this going to happen or not and kind of every phone call you have once you're in the negotiation process every phone call you're like is this going to be the one where we close the deal is this going to be the one where you know like I said they didn't bring up any big crazy surprise things but on every phone call I'm like maybe maybe they're G on this one this week on the channel we're continuing our series looking at Founders who've sold their companies we had a video a few weeks back with Derrik Rhymer and a sixf figure exit and today I'll talk with Laura rer about her seven figure exit selling meet Edgar before we dive in I wanted to thank our sponsor for this video Quiet Light brokerage I'll talk more about them in a minute I'm Laura rer I'm the founder of me Edgar and paper B what was Meet Edgar and who was it built for so meet Edgar is a social media scheduling tool Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Etc and our target market was solopreneurs Freelancers very small businesses and what problem specifically did it solve for those people so the problem meet Edgar did and does solve is creating a library of content for your social media accounts and then the tool automatically repurposing it over and over again which really means the problem it solves is fill up your social accounts with good high quality content and what were the price points and maybe the customer sizes or types yeah so our price point was always around $50 a month which I think is where it still is later we added a lower tier for $29 a month and our customer sizes were usually solo businesses way less than five people we did didn't have a way to work with larger businesses or Enterprise accounts or anything like that and you decided to sell it what about a year and a half ago what was the trigger that caused you to think I want to sell this actually the business had the growth had flattened out and I was kind of dissatisfied with the business and I considered a lot of different options of what to do with it and what I ended up doing was kind of putting it in maintenance mode so I let almost the entire team go it was kind of running on its own I did that for a few months I thought that's the path I wanted to take and then I didn't want to take that path and actually that was kind of the impetus for selling the business I thought I wanted to do the maintenance mode thing it wasn't fun I decided I would rather just sell it and that the math worked out better to sell it what wasn't fun about the maintenance mode I think like a lot of entrepreneurs the building in the beginning is very exciting that growth phase is very exciting uh to have a business that you know isn't grow gr is just it it felt very frustrating the idea was that I was just going to sort of accept that you know the cash was going to come in but I wanted to be building and improving something and can you give us an idea of where the business was at maybe Revenue wise when you made this decision yeah it was at a few million a year Topline reoccurring revenue and so you decide you don't want to do maintenance mode you're going to sell it what was the process like from there once I decided I wanted to sell the business uh the first thing did was go into research mode so the book that absolutely everyone must read is the art of selling your business by John waro I also recommend um before the exit by Dan Andrews is another great book to get the lay of the land so first I read those books and then I listened to as many episodes as I possibly could of the built to sell podcast thank you John waro for letting us all you know behind the scenes on on what real business sales look like I think both those steps are so important for anyone who wants to sell your business because it's a big new thing if you've never done it before there's a lot of stuff you don't know that you need to learn so that was kind of Step One learn all the things after I had done that it became clear to me that the acquisition type that I was going to go after was going to be a financial acquisition rather than a strategic acquisition or sale in my case because we didn't really have any strategic interest already it seems like when people sell their business strategically they often have some Partners or vendors or something in mind that they're thinking they'll probably work with that just wasn't our case we weren't you know getting all these emails saying we want to partner with you just wasn't didn't happen with me Edgar so I thought okay so it's going to be a financial sale and then I started thinking do I want to use a broker do I want to use one of these websites to sell it how do I want to do it and so I thought okay well I should start by researching who's buying you know relatively small SAS businesses like mine and basically by the time I done that research I kind of realized well I have the list of potential acquirers you know I've done my research I found the companies that are out there saying yes this is our thing we buy these kind of SAS businesses which are sometimes called micro PE firms the type of firm that bought my business and once i' done all that I kind of thought well if I already have my list of potential buyers maybe I can just run this process myself and I kind of figured why not give it a shot I was excited about doing it myself so why not give it a shot try to do it myself if it was a total failure I could go back to the drawing board and work with some sort of broker MMA adviser whatever you want to call it did you have any concerns that doing it on your own you might make a big mistake like get a lot less than the business was worth sort of but I felt like I was educated enough to have some idea of what the business was worth uh before I started I set a really clear number for what I would need out of the exit and I did have that maintenance mode to compare it to so it's like okay I have this cash flowing business that's going to pay me this much a month this much a year you know I did estimates of the revenue going down over time you know when I thought it might kind of Peter out entirely so I had a pretty good idea of how much it was worth and I felt excited about doing the negotiation it wasn't it was definitely something new but it was something that I was looking forward to diving into and how did you decide on the price so I set my own internal number that I actually tried to set kind of on the low side because uh a big factor for me which people don't often talk about is taxes so in my situation and in a lot of people's situations the taxes on selling a business were very significantly lower than the taxes of just collecting income for the business like about half for selling the business so that was actually a big factor in okay what's going to be the number that if I sell the business post taxes is going to be likely kind of a higher number than I would collect just letting the business run out and obviously also having that Assurance of getting the cash and all up front once I have the cash I can invest it blah blah blah so I tried to set my own extremely reasonable number which I think is also kind of the opposite of what you hear a lot of people who want to sell their business and they're like Well yeah if someone writes me a check for 50 million then sure it's like well but no one's going to write your business isn't worth 50 million so sorry but that's not that's not going to happen so I tried to set a number that I'm like I feel pretty confident that I'll be happy with this I can get this and then if I get more then great so what was the initial response you send all these emails to these micro firms like did most of them respond or only a handful most of them did respond and I I had a very targeted list of acquirers and I think something really important when you're selling your business is it's very important to Hype yourself up about how great your business is because in this whole process the other party is going to Chip Away way at the value of your business and let's be real you want to sell it you you see some problems with it right in in one way or the other right or else you would hold on to it so and it's our own business we're always looking at the problems how to make them better blah blah blah so I really hyped myself up convinced myself on the value of this business again nothing crazy but it's like okay I have this number that I feel very confident that it's worth and I was targeting companies that buy SAS businesses so you know it's not a super long list so I I think I had about like 10 kind of initial phone calls with people who were interested and I think even at that stage sometimes people get very intimidated being like Oh I'm going to bother these people it's like these people buy stas companies you're not bothering them you're saying hey I have the thing that you want to buy and so how long did it take to find a buyer and how long to actually close the deal so it was all extremely fast um so it took I think about 2 months from kind of first round of emails to um the LOI that turned out to be the LOI uh I sold my business to Shor Swift all they do is buy SAS companies so by the time they bought my company they had bought 40 SAS companies and kudos to them they had their process down so they told me it would be a 30-day due diligence and it was that's uh I think that's pretty rare well no I think a 30-day due diligence is extremely rare from what what I've heard about in other people's situations but this was a nice thing about working with a company that this is just kind of all they did day in and day out it was very formulaic for them also our financials were so simple 100% of our income came from stripe we didn't have any special deals we didn't have people writing us checks so it was a very simple business to vet financially and what was involved in that 30-day due diligence process uh so it was actually pretty simple you know I didn't need to hire a special accounting team or anything like that there was no quote unquote forens accounting where they're you know I've had friends whose's Acquisitions they're bringing in deoe and stuff even when it's totally ridiculous for the deal size so I had always done a good job with you know just the basic stats of the business and the bookkeeping and things like that so those were the things it's like we want to look at all the bookkeeping we want to look at the stripe account we want to look at the Google analytics account basically having firsthand access to make sure that all the numbers that I was saying were the real numbers in the business were there any surprises along the way I think think a big surprise for me uh was how much I enjoyed the process actually dealmaker dealer I had heard so many horror stories of it going terribly and I had never done anything like this before I was very positive and extremely cautious at the same time because a big thing I had learned from all the research I had done is that there are a lot of people out there that play a lot of games so I was on very high alert alert for all these red flags for the games um and I think sh Swift did an amazing job not playing games but I was also very conscious in just shut shutting anything down right away like I didn't get into when they would kind of a common thing in the negotiation right is they're going to bring up negative points about your business and be like oh what about this what about that and the way I handled that was always to say yeah you guys need to make a decision if this makes sense for you so if they're like I don't like this about the tech you know I'd be like you know what or they say we're going to have to bring in this big Tech Team or we're going to have to bring in this specialist I'd be like do the math you know if that's what you're going to need to do make sure the deal makes sense make sure the price makes sense I was never arguing about like oh no you won't need to do that or our teex great it was just like okay that's up to you we both need to feel happy with the price and that's all there is at the end of the day it's a really nice way to handle it really nice way so from the time you signed the letter of intent there's a 30-day due diligence did the the offer or the deal change at all during that time it did not change at all and so again I just have to give I have to give them props because I hear a lot of stories um where it does change and something else I did is once I had the LOI from Shor Swift I could see other companies that they had purchased uh so I called up some of those companies and asked them specifically that question did the price change from the LOI to the sale price um and a few of them told me that it had not I feel like I should throw in too while I'm talking about it the team at Short Swift that I worked with has actually all left now and is now at a company called big band so short Swift if you want to work with the people that I worked with they at a company called big band now and throughout this whole process what was the most stressful part of it for you the most stressful part was probably just the uncertainty that the whole thing wouldn't work because it was it it was a relatively short list like I said I had you know I had phone calls with like 10 different buyers um maybe none of them would just want a social media tool you know sometimes the Stars just don't align so I I I knew I would be able to sell it at some point to someone for some price but I didn't know if these would be the people if this would be the time so it it did feel like it was kind of a high pressure time and an exciting time too but also stressful just is this is this going to happen or not and kind of every phone call you have once you're in the I'm like maybe maybe they're GNA on this one so the deal closes you refresh your bank balance on your phone usually is what where people wind up doing it but you look at at that number with all those zeros what was the feeling that you felt in that moment well it's funny you know the negotiation was way more exciting than the close because the close I knew what was coming I knew what the number was going to be right I knew the day it was going to land so actually the negotiation was kind of the exciting part because that's when it was like oh are they going to you know I'm asking for more are they going to go for it how much more are they going to offer me that was like if there was an exciting part of the process it was that the truth is the number Landing just felt like the end of this process process that had already for for me it wasn't a super long time that it had been going on but just sort of closing the book rather than like the the big height of excitement and what are you working on today so today I'm working on paper bell which is another SAS business it's a tool for coaches like life coaches and business coaches to do their scheduling and
