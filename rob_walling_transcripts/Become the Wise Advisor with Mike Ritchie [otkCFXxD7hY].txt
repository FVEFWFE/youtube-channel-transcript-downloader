================================================================================

[Music] all right we are live back with our final sixth and final keynote of microcom promote thanks again for joining me and sticking around we're gonna have about a 20 minute conversation with mike ritchie and myself and he is the founder of sequel dot io he's gonna share how he tapped into authority building platforms to reach their earliest customers by providing insights and solutions to potential customers specifically on quora and stack overflow but during our conversation uh we'll talk about i'll bring up several other q a platforms that i believe can be used for similar purposes it's early stage sas it's getting 10 50 or the first hundred customers and with that let's welcome mike richie to the show how's it going sir good have you doing all right thanks for joining us today we're gonna um as i was telling folks we're gonna have about a 20-minute chat you have some slides prepared and then we will have 10 minutes of q a ish and we'll wrap around sometime around uh 9 30 pacific 12 30 uh eastern so with that i'll let you take it away from here um you can intro yourself and and dive into the slides and then we'll i'll chime in as needed yeah sounds good and just set some context because i'm sure not everyone is familiar with with my small niche of the world my small company so sql is an app that helps customers our customers which are generally data analysts people that know sql but are not too much more tech savvy than that it helps those analysts push data from their data warehouse into other applications so you can think of those things or places that are interesting to push data as places like google sheets slack even things like salesforce just all this insight and data that's locked up in a customer in one of our customers data warehouses we just make it dead simple for anyone that knows sql to get it out of their warehouse and drop it into other places that they're interested in and when i first built the product i started completely as a side project um it was something that i kind of used and dabbled with a bit at my last company and decided you know kind of spin off as a little side project got some customers pretty early um but after that very first customer i realized okay this is you know something that people might actually want to use might be interested in um so started to kind of think about like how you know marketing would look and how we could kind of get on the first you know 10 users after that first user um and um robert are the are the slides up because i only see myself right now there we go cool and i guess that i can control it with this there we go great um so you know this first slide is basically what the initial strategy was which was try to find places that people were asking questions or really trying to figure out how to build our product on their own so that would look like you know for our specific use case it would look like people trying to write python scripts and trying to set up servers and do all these things to try to like automate this data flow from their warehouse into these other destinations like google sheets so this is like really clunky process that people were fault you know hitting problems you know in multiple steps along the way they might be getting they might be getting caught up with going through the google oauth process in terms of like getting credentials set up they might be getting jammed up with getting it set on a schedule so having a server set up and making sure that that's running reliably 24 7. there's a ton of different places that they could be falling you know falling into a trap or hitting a roadblock and you know basically that's what we try to do is we try to help people overcome that individual roadblock that they hit um so you know maybe it was um you know authenticating to their database with python we were helping people answer that question but then we were also saying hey by the way this is going to be a pain 12 more times like you're going to run into 12 more roadblocks um sql is perfectly built to solve this problem so you might want to you know give that give that a try and instead of you know building it yourself um so you know this this tweet was you know mentioned i guess earlier earlier this month but it's basically kind of encapsulates our early strategy um and you know one of the first places that we looked um was basically just you know google searching and finding places that that people have bumped into this issue and kind of already like answered the questions or started to answer the question um so this is you know a screenshot from stack overflow and it's funny you know there's there's 12 upvotes here but i could say you know with pretty solid confidence that this one post on stack overflow has generated thousands of dollars in mrr for us um since since we initially answered the question so it's only 12 up votes but tons of people have seen this and it's really highly qualified traffic that we get in so this stack overflow question ranks pretty highly on on google for various questions that are related to our product and you can see the answer here is you know crisp to the point hey if you don't want to solve this yourself um you know sequel's out there we've always tried to be as transparent as possible it's like hey we're one of the founders you know just your full transparency like we built this product so it's you know it's clear that you're where the pitch is coming from it's not you know it's not that we're trying to hide it and post it from you know a ghost account or position it is though it's one of our customers that's answering anything like that we're always transparent that it's us that's answering the question and then we just try to be crisp and and not canned in terms of the response so we try to cater the response whether it's you know a place like core stack overflow we cater the response to the exact question as opposed to just pasting in you know a blanket response that's used for all questions i think the next slide has an example of quora um so this was another question that we found pretty early on um in our history in terms of um when we initially launched um one thing with quora that's nice is it's and actually stack overflow as well as you you can update the question or update your answer over time as you add new features or as you kind of improve the product so this is exactly what we did here is when we initially launched the product uh it was the ui was terrible it was it was actually you know pretty janky and clunky product so this post was actually updated multiple times as we improved our product and as the screenshots look cleaner as the product neovision became more concise we updated these answers and you know made you made the value prop more more clear so it was actually something we did call it like every quarter to every like six months as we kind of go back through these top posts which obviously like attribution and tracking is pretty important for understanding where your customers are coming from so that you know which of these posts actually matter to update um but we've kept that um we've kept that like log of the posts that still matter or the answers that still matter to us and we go back and update those regularly if if necessary um so this is one example in quora and then the third place that we really found some initial and early traffic and it's it's not really a q a um site but it is a place that a lot of our customers were going to for answers so there's actually and this is a very little known uh marketplace that oddly has a very large user base like you can kind of see some of the numbers that are in just this screenshot but if you're looking for an idea i'd fully encourage you to go to google work workspace marketplace and just kind of search around at some of the products that have traction there there's applications that are that are literally just for like add-ons to google forms that have millions of users uh and terrible reviews so there's things like apps that are being widely used that are paid apps that have terrible reviews and are poorly built seems like a pretty good um combination for someone looking for you know a side project or a new project to work on but in our use case um you know pretty early on we realized that customers were looking for solutions here we actually by default had to have a listing here for the initial version of our application so it wasn't something that we discovered on our own like we had to be listed here but once we realized how many customers were finding us through the marketplace we really worked to improve our ratings improve our reviews you can see here in the screenshot we have a 4.9 star review with with almost 3 000 users for the first app we actually have two apps in the marketplace one for for forms and one for google sheets so five star review on the other one and we really worked on making sure we were number one in the search results for different terms that matter to us so basically anything you search for that matters to our company likes postgres snowflake anything like that uh we are the number one search result and we get a ton of traffic through here um so again thousands and thousands of dollars of mrr with no spend so it's not like we're you know paying for placement here it's it's it's purely um just doing the work to get uh to get the app reviewed well and and enlisted well um and i think yeah so i think that that's it on the marketplaces those were the three that we really leaned on um early on especially to get the first you know 10 first hundred customers um the i guess the the overall strategy you know i already mentioned being transparent so making sure that uh anyone that we um anyone that we were quote unquote like selling to through these marketplaces knew um you know who it was that was selling to them and knew that we were associated with the company um always trying to you know speak the language it was it was pretty easy for me just because i was you know i kind of was our customer um so i knew sql i wasn't much of a developer so i didn't know a ton about like back-end infrastructure and things like that in terms of setting up servers so um i was kind of our customer so i was able to kind of speak that language but if you're not your customer make sure that you're not you know getting too far into like technical jargon things that the customer doesn't care about um in terms of you know sound like a sales person so we were just very direct in terms of answering their questions um and then you know the last one which is is probably the most important is uh really showing showing how painful free can be um so yeah we were like digitalocean has some great posts on this um their early strategy was very much along these lines is like just showing how incredibly painful it is to manage machines on aws or set up a new you know spin up a new instance on aws at the time that the digital ocean launched so you know we took that exact um same playbook and exact same strategy in terms of like hey setting this all up on your on your own is going to be a complete nightmare this is not something you want to manage especially when our product starts at 50 bucks a month um this should be you know kind of an absolute no-brainer for you for at least you know to at least give us a trial as opposed to trying to solve this problem yourself because free isn't always you know really free um when you kind of factor in all the hours it's going to take to for you to kind of build this on your own so um that's pretty much the tips rob any any questions on on your side yep yeah let me let me dive in with a couple comments um because actually i have done very similar approach to what you've done and i did it with hit tail which was a long tail seo keyword tool it was a sas app and so at that time i went to quora subscribe to all the seo and keyword research topics and i would chime in similar to you i use the i was very personal i always uh i always divulged you know that i by the way i run hit tail but the big thing was i would absolutely show them and this is a decade ago but i would say they would say how do i do keyword research and i'd say here's how you can do it screenshot screenshot go through google do this or click through to this site pay 20 bucks a month you know but disclosure i'm the you know i'm the owner of it but it it literally became it it's almost like uh you know doing the selling for you and even it's funny because you said you know one of those posts had 12 up votes but it's created thousands of dollars in value for you similar with with hit tail and then with drip actually i uh you know drip being an email service provider i subscribe to all the email marketing and the um or really a bunch of just email marketing questions and it was similar where ones wouldn't get that many upvotes but it would just drive highly highly targeted traffic so even if i only got 30 50 visitors a month from those threads um you know they would convert to trial at like 10 20 when the rest of the site was converting at 2.1 or 2 it was because they were so qualified and already so interested in the problem so there's a lot of value there and of course these days even i answer stuff about sas and marketing and this and that because it's you know it's the the podcast uh micro conf and tiny stuff that i'm thinking about these days so there's a lot of value here and what we do have a question that i'll get to in a second but i wanted to point out some other sites obviously quora is is the general one um but and it covers well it covers a lot of it started out as more of a silicon valley kind of startup topics and then it's really expanded from there stack overflow is the technical one um and obviously stack exchange has a bunch of different uh i mean i believe they have hundreds of different ones now i mean they have rpg.stack exchange and they have english literature and grammar you know just all kinds of stuff so there's a lot of options there um reddit is another place that i've seen folks if you're involved in um you know a specific if there's a sql users group or developer users group or uh you know a startup users group whatever that's a place i've seen people be helpful on the internet and those can rank if there's a question they can rank in google clarity.fm is another one that i think people forget clarity is for phone uh mostly it's for connecting with consultants via phone chat about phone calls but they now have a um that you can get involved with and those are the ones that the interesting thing is there's a whole other strategy where it's going facebook groups forums and and slack groups you know like microsoft connect those are also helpful but they're different in that you don't get seo out of it right that's the thing is that quora clarity stack overflow reddit these things tend to rank in google for the for the answer to the question that that person is asking and you would love for your website to rank number one for the answer to that question but you don't have the juice you know none of us have the juice that cora or these other sites do so that's what i'll say kind of is bringing my personal experience to it as well as um kind of expanding on that in terms of there are other options you know it's not just the three you you pointed out course tech overflow and google workspace marketplace which i had never heard of um that's funny all right we got a couple questions uh from one is from adam he says i think you may have covered this but but you know reiterate mike he says do you have any thoughts on using personal accounts for example adam versus company accounts example the name is my company on course deck overflow etc uh we always used personal accounts i always felt that that was much less salesy um so wherever wherever possible we always used a personal account yep that's what i did as well and the nice part especially on quora you can put rob walling comma you know founder of drip founder of whatever and so your your company makes it in anyways but then you're a human being it's like nobody wants a question answered by a company it's i'm instantly suspect when i see that right but if it's by a person who's the ceo or a founder i actually give them credibility a question from kristin carney how do you find questions let's see how do you find the right questions to answer on the platform did you answer hundreds of questions or did you somehow id the questions with a lot of views you weigh in first yeah i don't want to tell folks so i did it so that's absolutely a great question because quora is just an absolute flood of of the same question over and over so you can waste a lot of time answering 100 versions of basically the same the way the simple method we used is just google searching so if so we searched through google for the questions that we cared about for the key terms that we cared about and then whatever ranked there from quora we would then click through to quora and answer those questions so if you search directly on quora for something like if you just search the a draw a broad term like uh postgres or google sheets things along those lines there will be dozens of the same question over and over the ones that we really focused on were the ones that were um basically the ones that were ranking in google one other side note on on quora is that you can get tricked probably into um running ads there or promoting your post um just just our own experience we actually tried that out it seemed like a no-brainer it's like oh like we can instantly get our our answer to suppose uh to jump to the top it was a complete failure it did not work at all they uh their ad platform is also terrible in terms like setting all that up and then getting it to um to display appropriately so getting the the promotion to display on the questions that you wanted to was also a disaster so just a quick a quick aside is that like ads on core did not work at all for us versus doing the questions completely for free worked really well that's good to know because i've never tried quora ads and i always see quora ads because i am i'm on core i get their weekly digest and so i'm on it once a week kind of searching through the stuff of course the digest is always like mcu movie trivia and what's going on with dungeons and dragons and that kind of stuff so it's like nothing to do with startup which is actually a nice break but i see the ads all the time and i i kind of have at the back of my head like i wonder if i should try those so interesting data point there um i like that about google searching i wish i had thought of that because i would go through i would subscribe to the topics and then i'd try to be the first answer for a lot of them and i that worked uh it worked well it always worked in terms of i would usually start getting upvotes quickly but if those didn't appear in search results anywhere then i wouldn't get a lot of traffic from those so it's it is an interesting uh approach i like what you're what you're thinking another question how do you make your answers not to sound promotional yeah and that that is actually hard so if you the first draft if you're thinking you know selling the product it's probably going to come across the sales like the thing i always came back to is if you are answering the question from a place that you're not involved with the company at all um so almost put yourself in a you know customers or potential customers shoes um but that that absolutely is something that we had to work on early on and i found the best way for me to do it um was to pretend that i was answering the question either to someone that i knew um so like just put yourself um in a an actual situation where someone that you know is asking you the question and like a specific person um so i would pretend like oh like our product manager at our last company is asking me this question how would i answer him like and making it a specific person worked really well for me um because if you're answering it to like the internet like just broadly you can come across as like maybe sounding a little bit too like polished or maybe too like uh on the pr side versus if you're answering a friend or you know a previous co-worker it'll probably come across more natural uh we didn't a b test this obviously so who knows if it works or not but that's the way that um felt better to me and i guess if like upvotes versus down votes mean anything it seems like you know rob mentioned places like reddit um when we when we answered more naturally it seems like you know people appreciate that and and um you know welcome it more than something that's more kind of salesy or marketing yeah i like that of just talking pretend you're talking to a human or you're answering a friend in an email thread or a slack thread right and it's like what would i actually tell them i would say well here i'm going to answer your question and then i'm going to tell you probably don't do that is usually the way it winds up you know and it can come off not salesy then another from mark he says i don't have a quora can i create one today and start answering right away or do you have to warm up your account first i don't think you could warm up your account um i definitely answered the first day so i started answering questions i did use like our domain so i signed up with our you know like at sequel.io domain so i did create a separate new account for for sql for the company um but yeah you can start answering right away i don't think they do too much i don't think they're trying to be too clever around like new accounts there is a lot of spam on quora so you you know you do have the possibility of being drowned out by a lot of other spam but um yeah i don't think you need any warm-up period yeah i i agree with you i think they rely on their upvote down vote system since it is a human-powered you know voting system the spam does get can get down voted quickly and so um i think if you sign up and start answering questions with value and and you do get up votes that pretty quickly you'll get the reputation you need to to continue answering any other questions from folks checking the slack and i have a question for you did you was this something you did in the early days to get early traction and then you stopped at a certain point where it just didn't move the needle for you anymore or is it something that you continue to do today yeah this was definitely this was the very first thing we did um which was just google search and we knew we weren't gonna have domain credibility um from day one so we google searched found places that we could answer this question that did have domain authority that would show up and rank in seo results and that was like the very first thing we did as far as like ongoing um it has not been much of a strategy like say like the past year um and we have mainly just been in maintenance mode so if um you know if a post if a particular post is just looking outdated um so it's just not really uh displaying the current product anymore we will we will update them um some newer channels like as opposed to like core and stack overflow have worked well for us so like as we added more integrations and destinations new forums um became relevant to us um so specifically like salesforce when we added salesforce as a destination for our product we did go we kind of dug into their their archives and their you know previous you know q and a forms there which are very active like there's a ton of salesforce developers out there a ton of people that use salesforce in general obviously um so there are questions that are you know super relevant to our product that we've you know kind of gone in and answered um but the uh the amount of work to like keep up with it is actually like really really low um so like if you if you kind of like have it to do once or twi you know once a month or once every other month um i think that's more than enough to like keep up with um maybe even like a dozen or so different sources and questions yeah and i think that's something good to take away is that's why this is these are you know this whole microcomp remote 2.0 event is around getting that first 10 50 or 100 customers it's this is not gonna i don't see the scaling the only time i've seen the scale is jason lemkin built the entire sashter brand on cora and then he republished on his blog and that's the one person i've seen who like built a you know huge personal brand but other than that it's usually what you've said and how i've described hit tail and drip is you do it in the early days and it gets you highly qualified folks not a huge amount but enough that you know you can use it to get early traction and then from there on it's it's just maintenance there is a question from eric and he he's asking like i think during the active time when you were you know really targeting this how much time in a given week did you spend answering questions uh super low uh like five or ten minutes a week maybe um it was it thought you know a lot of it was a one-time find everything make a spreadsheet with all all the questions and go through and answer them all at once um so you know kind of upfront investment you know definitely less than 10 hours and you know especially when you think about like getting how painful it can be to get your first 10 customers if you have the right product that kind of fits into this um the type of product that can be successful with this strategy we easily got more than our first 10 customers with with less than 10 hours of work of just going through finding the relevant questions answering them really well um and you know just tracking and making sure that we knew where those customers were coming from um so yeah like less than 10 hours initial investment and then ongoing you know we've been around for almost three years now and i'd say like life to date it's probably another like 10 or 20 hours so it's really low investment yeah and uh i like about um what i like about doing quora and stack overflow and these others is that usually when you see the question it's obvious to you what the answer is but it's not obvious to everyone else because you're the expert like you're knee-deep in this stuff i mean you can call out particular api calls or you can call out particular numbers i mean again when i answer questions on quora about b2b sas marketing i'm like referencing page 27 of the state of independent sas that we ran because it's just it's just all in your head and you forget how knowledgeable and how deep your knowledge is these are not things that you research um at least i never did it was always like you know what are best prac what are the biggest mistakes people make in email marketing and it's like well i can list five right now because i see it every day and drip right it's not that i have to go and spend a bunch of time like writing a dissertation it just kind of it comes out of me because you're you're knee-deep in it another question from yeah there's a question from justin okay yep now as you said that's a great point on on our product as well as like this this is a lot of times a person that spent like 10 15 minutes trying to figure out how to solve this problem and we've meanwhile spent like six months building a company around it so like you're exactly spot on rob it's like it's someone that's like hey this is a really annoying problem i'm trying to solve it right now um they're asking it from a place of like you know maybe 10 to 15 minutes of experience on like working on it so you might come across as like the most brilliant person on earth if you you know answer their question well after having worked on the product or the problem for three to six months we have a question from justin he says what were some examples of the google searches you did uh literally the question right so for for our product um you know we and this is another i think this is a general um theme that rob and michael in general pushes is like niche down like you'll find a niche we were super niche at first like we basically only solved like one problem which was getting data from your database into google sheets so it was like write sql connected to your database you know whether that's like postgres mysql whatever it is and instead of having the results you ever turned into your ide we were sending the results to somewhere like google sheets so like that was that was the um the problem we solved like that was the niche so we just searched every iteration of that problem it's like how do i send or how do i connect postgres to google sheets and those different words in between were actually pretty important to us so things like how do you um how do you send postgres data to google sheets how do you connect postgres to google sheets like all these different iterations and kind of synonyms for various words in that search term were important for us finding um this those first few questions so trying all the different iterations like you know mysql instead of postgres snowflake which is a popular data warehouse instead of postgres um kind of like adding all those different iterations and combinations like that's what we did to build that spreadsheet and say hey these are the 50 questions that we want to answer and then we just went through and knocked them out you know again in like less than 10 hours that first first go around all right yeah justin responded he said those examples are gold thank you and that's the thing you know you can you go to google to find out what's ranking in google but you can also go directly to quora and you can type in in your example you could type in postgres google sheets in the search box and see what comes up to see what wording because there's going to be a bunch of questions with those two in it and there's going to be all those connect you know transfer transmit you know whatever else and then you can do the same thing sql server google sheets and uh yeah that's great all right we are at time sir thank you so much for uh coming and dropping dropping your knowledge today i know that you know judging by that the level of the questions in the number of them i know that provided a lot of value for folks today awesome thanks for having me rob absolutely you
