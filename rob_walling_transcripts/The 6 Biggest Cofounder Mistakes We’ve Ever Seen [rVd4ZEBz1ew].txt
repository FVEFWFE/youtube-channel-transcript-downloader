between my startup accelerator and my personal portfolio of SAS Investments I've invested in more than 170 companies and I have seen my share of co-founder and partnership mistakes that have led to the company imploding so in this video I'm going to be joined by founder and executive coach Dr Sher Walling and we're going to talk through the six biggest partnership mistakes we've seen if you stick around to the end I have a seventh bonus mistake that just might be the most important one in the video Dr Walling thanks for joining me on the channel today always good to be with you rob you want to kick us off with the first partnership mistake yeah man partnership mistakes will take down your business as you well know uh but the first one that I wanted to talk about is people not beginning with the end in mind that means they sort of launch into running a business together and it's very exciting and things are flowing maybe customers are popping and they're ready to go but they don't really stop to have any conversations about what this ending looks like do they want an exit do they want a lifestyle business what are their goals what are their plans and they don't sit down and have the very important conversation around the sort of terms and agreements that govern the relationship that they have as it relates to leading their company it's easy to kick this can down the road especially when it's like maybe I'm not 100% sure if I want to sell for a million 10 million million but maybe I'm 80% sure that if we got an offer for x million I would take it but realistically longterm I just want to take out dividends whether I'm sure or not having that conversation with a co-founder is critical because if you get involved with a co-founder who's like someone puts a million dollars on the table I want to sell and you're like oh that's totally not my goal it's going to be a problem but a document that governs how that conversation happens and the ackowledgement that there may need to be a conversation like that at some point is really I think the point here is understand that there are all of these intricacies to this relationship over time and it's going to be tricky there will be moments when your values and needs and desires aren't aligned but that's why you have an operating agreement that's why you sit down with a lawyer that's why you have these difficult conversations right at the beginning so that there's a system in place yeah and there's going to be some things preferences or desires that aren't going to be captured in an operating agreement like I was saying if some co-founder may be like first time I see a million-- dollar check I'm selling the company you know and and someone else may want to go bigger than that and just having that conversation at least with a preference thing of like well these are these are the options and these are the ranges of things that I'm thinking about these are kind of my goals for the company I think is critical absolutely mistake number two is not vesting ownership and if you don't know what that means vesting is where you receive your shares over a period of time so usually two co-founders will vest over four years where the standard is you don't get any stock for the first year then you get 25% of it at the end of 12 months and then it vests monthly after that up to your you know whatever your allocation is the problem with not doing this is we've seen companies where two co-founders each own 50% of the company they get five months in 6 months eight months in one leaves and they own half the company they own the shares and there's nothing you can do at that point you can't take them back legally unless they want to give them back which in some cases people have but you've effectively killed the company or at least crippled it you can't raise investment no investor will invest in that if you build the company and grow it to ions and sell it that co-founder who barely put any work in gets half the money and so that the other co-founder usually doesn't want to do that yeah the third mistake that I've seen Partnerships make is really not being clear about the type of relationship that they have again this is interchange between humans and it's important to be really clear about the the tone of the relationship and how that will eventually affects the company culture you know I've seen co-founders who are best friends maybe they were roommates in colle or best friends from high school so they have this deep working relationship but how does that then transfer into running a business together it's not the same kind of relationship so being clear about the boundaries of how much sort of personal life and personal experience is shared between the two of the founders or if there are more I really don't like it when co-founders refer to themselves as family or they refer to their teams as a family I think that really communicates a level of sort of personal responsibility and long-term commitment that is really not representative of what it means to be in a business together so getting clear early what is the language that we use for this relationship how does that filter down to the kind of culture that we set up for our company when we do have employees or team members and how do we have some segmentation or separation between our professional partnership and our personal lives the fourth mistake that I've seen several times actually is when two or more co-founders have pretty much the identical skill set set so you imagine two software developers getting together to start a SAS company and guess what they both want to do they want to develop software all the time they want to write code so nobody wants to do operations no one wants to do sales no one wants to do marketing no one wants to talk to customers and similarly I'd imagine if two s I've never seen this but two sales people try to start a ass company you know what they they want to sell they want to sell but they have no technical expertise right so this is it can cut in a lot of ways with people stepping on each other's Toes or with there just being a real lack of diversity of skill set I've also kind of seen it on the other end of the spectrum where you have two co-founders where I think this is the the best combination of two co-founders with very different uh skill sets but the problem that can arise there is they don't really understand or appreciate the other person's skill set right the person who is maybe more technical uh doesn't fully understand or appreciate the like deep intelligence and energy and time effort that goes into creating a sales funnel and vice versa you're you're like more people person sales-oriented person may not really understand the complexity and integy of architecting a piece of software that's really amazing and so it's really important for co-founders to do the work to sort of get in each other's zone of Genius enough to understand and appreciate and really give it value yeah some of the best combinations that we see come through Tiny Seed especially since we invest in SAS right which is software companies it's a developer and then either a sales or a marketing focused co-founder and sometimes subject matter expert can be good too if they're an expert in in a specific Niche but having either a sales or a marketing bent plus a developer seems to be a winning combination the fifth partnership mistake that I've seen a handful of times and I've seen it wreck companies is uneven compensation and I want to couch this this one's almost a little hard to explain but I've seen companies where there's two or three co-founders and one of the co-founders lives pretty inexpensively and has money in the bank that they can live for a year or two and so they don't take a salary but the other founder or other co-founders do take a salary and that all sounds like Hey we're all doing this for the good of the company we're all on the same page we moving forward Flash Forward a year that first co-founder has drained a huge chunk of their savings and the other Founders have not and there's this you know what I mean so it's it's not that everyone salaries have to be identical but it's like are we all putting in the same amount of skin in the game and what that means for people's level of safety and communication and I mean it just has all kinds of relationship sh Dynamics implications when there's uneven compensation without a lot of clarity about why that is how long that will be there's some equalizing Force whether that's Sweat Equity or other kinds of risk that make that feel okay and fair right because otherwise resentment Creeps in over time and that can kill can and has killed companies yeah yeah the last one that I want to talk about which is it's a big overarching one but is simply co-founders not spending the time to really work on their relationship to understand that the amount of time they spend together the way they communicate the Cadence of maybe inperson meetings if they're distributed all of those things matter a great deal to the working relationship to the sense of trust to the ability to pick up when something is maybe going wrong when your partner is approaching burnout when they are having problematic patterns like you don't notice that stuff if you don't have eyes on or you don't have a Cadence of being together so when people are doing a good job at co-founder relationships or Partnerships they are practicing forgiveness you know they have a system where they're say they're checking in about how is this working for you am I bugging you what's going wrong in the ways that we're interacting and how do we keep that clean and clear and without a lot of baggage or relational resentment that will come in and create a lot of havoc in the business the metaphor of a co-founder relationship being similar to a marriage it holds up in a lot of ways and this is another example of that if you're married for any length of time and you're not working on the relationship it will fall apart and it's same thing with co-founders and the need to do that consistently I think sometimes people give it more attention at the beginning of a business but there has to be a Cadence of staying current of making sure that your relationship is growing alongside your business along inside your lives so that you're not relating to the person that you started your business with as the 25-year-old when now they're 40 right time has pass how do you stay current and keep those relationship patterns really healthy and there's no way to do that except to do it intentionally in a second I'm going to give you a seventh bonus mistake just might be the most important one in the video but before I do that I want to recommend one of the best YouTube channels on the Internet it's Dr Sherry Wallings it's youtube.com/ Sherry Walling we will link it up in the description for this video what type of topics do you cover the whole range of things from mental health personal growth and development relationships anything that's important to a Founder entrepreneur High performer type and they when they're thinking about what's going on between their ears in their mind their mindset so it's focused on people who do hard things entrepreneurs Executives and the like that's youtube.com/ Sherry Walling the seventh mistake I've seen several times and it just might be the most important one in this video is not putting things in writing and what's interesting is everything doesn't need to be a legal dock signed by two people and notorized just having a bulleted list that communicates something between two co-founders that is not legally binding but is just a list that people can refer back to can be invaluable the idea here is that human memories are faulty and over time people remember things differently they forget commitments they made and just having an email exchange having a bulleted list in a Google doc or or maybe a legal dock if if you want it to be legally enforcable but just having something like that can make things a lot clear when you get down the road even with all the headaches and potential drama that can come with having a co-founder it's often the right choice for many people and if you're trying to find a co-founder for your startup check out this video do you want to dive into to the first partnership mistake my first one that I you want to kick off the first [Music]
