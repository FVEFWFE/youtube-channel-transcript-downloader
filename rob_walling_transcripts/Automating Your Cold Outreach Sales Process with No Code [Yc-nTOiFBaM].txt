today i'm excited to share with you uh basically all my tools and processes that i use for no for no code outreach for email for linkedin outreach um and i'm not going to just be sharing uh about sales i'm also gonna be sharing uh what i'm doing for outreach for a few other things as well like pr and um link building as well um so real quick uh you know rob did a great great intro for me my name is andy cabaso i'm a co-founder at postdagga with the current uh with the spring 2021 tiny seed batch and before i founded bostoga i started an agency that grew and sold and was acquired um so today i'm gonna be talking about a few different things and i wanted to kind of break down what you should all be expecting so first i'm going to talk about what our workflow is like when we're doing outreach so that we can all be on the same page and kind of see where we're going with this i'm also going to be sharing uh some of the tools that we're using uh when we're doing this i'm also going to share a cheat sheet at the end so you don't need to write make sure you write all of it down as soon as you see that slide i'm going to talk about prospecting and different methods that i'm using for prospecting i'm gonna be talking about uh outreach via email as well as linkedin and then what do we do after we we're doing our outreach and people are responding to us how do we keep track of that and i've got a few no code solutions for that as well i also want to share kind of some tips and best practices from the trenches and then at the end we'll do a q a so a bit about the outreach workflow and so when i'm doing cold outreach um there's basically a few steps to the process the first is prospecting i need to find people that i want to connect with and whether it's sales or pr or link building i need to find people that are relevant to what my goal is so if i'm looking for sales i need to find potential customers if i'm looking for link building i need to find websites that are relevant to uh mine relevant to my pitch and if it's pr i want to look for podcasters and journalists that are covering topics that my ideal audience is interested in after that there is the outreach itself once we've got our prospects we need to connect with them either via email or linkedin and i'll share both and tools i'm using for that as well as the close so after someone responds to you and if you're sending a lot of outreach especially if you're doing sales outreach some teams are doing thousands of emails a week or even a day for really high volume stuff and you need a way to manage all of that this next slide is all about the tools i use and i'm going to be the ones that are bolded here are the ones that i am going to be showing examples of and i'm going to repeat this slide at the very end so you don't need to uh furiously write down all of these um i have different tools that i'm using for prospecting from scrapers to directories seo tools and other platforms uh tools that i'm using for uh email outreach and linkedin outreach uh as well as uh integrations and automations that i'm using for uh for managing my conversations and in my preferred crm next up i want to talk about uh prospecting and in particular a few different tools that i'm using in the process and so for prospecting for sales i want to find people that could be potential customers for my business and there are a few different tools that i use for this prospecting uh the first uh are like directories like lead fuse um or zoom info or clear bit and these platforms basically are just giant directories of uh that uh have lists of businesses and then uh you can export them to a csv and some of these directories do have email addresses with them um that's nice other directories might not have email addresses for these contacts and then there's another step that you can take to find working email addresses for those businesses other tools i use scrapers so if i've got a directory that has a list of i can use a no code scraping tool to grab all the info from that directory and then bring into my other tools and then another tool is linkedin whether it's this you know just like the search or the sales navigator and i'm going to show you how i'm doing this for a later with linkedin outreach uh if i'm doing prospecting for link building i can use a keyword research tool or seo tool like ahrefs or scm rush um and for pr i'll show you about this i use spark toro um and also uh my platform postaga does have prospecting uh elements for for all for a bunch of these different strategies as well so next up uh i want to show you some examples of how i'm prospecting uh for uh for things like sales and so let me i'm gonna share with you a few different examples for sales i'm going to show hexamatic for link building outreach i'm going to show hrefs and for pr i'm going to show sparktoro let's let's just take a look now at how i'm going to find uh a particular type of business and so let's say i want to prospect marketing agencies and so if i do like a google search for example for marketing agencies i can get a bunch of results here uh in google but there are some directory sites like uh clutch for example is a good one um that has a list here of 37 000 seo agencies wouldn't it be great if i could grab all of these sites um and with a tool like hexamatic i can and so i'm just gonna copy this real quick so if i jump into hexomatic here um hexomatic is a scraping tool basically what i'm what i'm doing here is for their scraping recipe i put in the url of the page i want to grab and now hexamatic is going to render this here and it's going to show me all right so here's what the page looks like what elements from this page do you want to grab so if i click on this i want to grab like the name of this business um i'm going to select not just this one but all of the items on the page that match this like div or a section and so that grabs for me all of these elements that are similar and so those are all business names so now i've got the names of all of the businesses on this page that's great um next i also want to grab the website addresses for all of these businesses and so if i click this button now and select all the type of what type of content is this well this is a link url a link to these sites and now as you'll see here's an example of value i've got this business's website address and so it's going to repeat that for all of these now on this with this action here i can grab all of the business names and grab all of their uh website urls but in addition to that this is a big directory i want to grab information from all of these pages and so the next thing i can do if i click this button basically having the scraper move across multiple pages i've got pagination and so um it wants to know a bit more information like what's the url here and what's the kind of code for what a different page number is and so here i've got the url for this particular page um and this item i'm going to be replacing here is the page number and so i can go to from pages one to like 900 or whatever it is and now as i see here it's gonna grab all of these pages and then repeat this process and i can run this in this scraper and basically and get all this information into a csv or spreadsheet and so here is what that ends up looking like so i've got now all of these sites with uh all of their domains and if i'm using another tool like an email finding tool i can find email addresses for for all of these that's basically how i'm doing that in addition to to that i want to talk quick about like link building outreach and so i want to do outreach to build links to my blog article because i want to help it get more traffic so let's say i've got this article about how to find affiliates if i go into a tool like ahrefs here and i search for a particular keyword in this keyword explorer and something find affiliates it will then give me information about the keyword itself uh relevant keywords but it'll also tell me who are the top ranking articles on this term and who is linking to them now this in particular is interesting to me now there are a lot of different link building tactics tactics and strategies out there uh but this one that i'm kind of going to show you right here is called the skyscraper technique and how it works basically i'm i can find all of these sites that are linking to these other articles on the topic and since i know that they're linking to this other article i'm going to want to reach out to them to say hey i saw that uh you've got this article which mentions how to find uh i've got a great article and video on the topic you should definitely link to at my article as a resource in your article so it provides more value for your audience and i can export this to a csv file and then bring that into my email outreach platform sparktor is another tool that i use for um pr outreach and it's a business intelligence tool and basically how it works is it can tell you what websites or podcasts or or social media platforms are people interacting with who are interested in this other topic so if i for example am saying like all right so my i i'm curious about who is the people that are reading articles on ahrefs.com for example what else are they following what else are they interested in and so if i if i search for that um this tool will tell me all right well people who read ahrefs or and visit that website are also following these blogs and so i might want to reach out to these blogs to pitch them to uh do some either co-marketing or have me write a guest blog post or uh or something like that and so um that is that so that's what and then once i do that i can export that all to a csv and all of this like research and stuff that prospecting that we're doing all comes down to csvs so next up i want to talk about the next stage in the process which is email outreach and so we've done our prospecting now we know what uh websites we what websites and businesses we want to connect with the next thing that we need to do is uh find or potentially find working email addresses for these people and email them so uh what i'm going to do is uh and there are aside from postdog which is the platform that i use and recommend there are other platforms out there and other tools out there that can help you find email addresses or build and send personalized emails but um for this example i'm going to be using kostaga and i'll show you kind of what i do for my prospecting basically basically postaga is a kind of an all-in-one uh outreach email outreach specific platform and what it can do is it'll find uh it can do some prospecting find relevant businesses to connect with then find the right contact people and email addresses for them and then build and send personalized email sequences and i'll now show you a quick run-through of of what that looks like so i'm gonna just quickly jump into uh my postaga account and i'm gonna just show you kind of like a quick campaign that i've created and so i've taken i am importing a csv from my prospecting um and uh from that csv um postaga will find contact people for these different websites and it does this automatically um it's trying to find who is the most relevant person and that you can do this manually it's a pain and takes a lot of time but our tool also find what will automatically try and find uh those people uh through an integration we have here with linkedin so after we find the right contact people we need to find working email addresses for them and so next up postage will find find uh working email addresses for these people making sure that these email addresses are validated so when we email them we know that those emails won't bounce um that's very important um there are some tools out there that'll find you email addresses based or it's like a directory of email addresses but there's no guarantee that those email addresses are validated and if they're not and you have too many emails that bounce because those aren't real working email addresses you can get into trouble with your sending domain where your email can end up emails can end up in spam folders um next up what i'm doing in my process i've got an email sequence that i'm going to be sending to these contacts automatically the platform will personalize these emails for each of these contacts and this is a template that i've been using and so i might reach out to these uh different agencies pitching them to check out my software basically now i can see like all of these emails are personalized for every one of these contacts and that saves me a ton of time from having to do that manually myself it just automatically personalize these for these contacts and if i want i can spend time in personalizing these emails further but if i don't want to if i just want to email all uh in a sequence all of these 32 thousand agencies uh postage will will help me do that uh really easily and quickly uh that's a quick run through of what i do for email outreach uh the next thing i wanna talk about is linkedin outreach now with linkedin outreach um basically what i'm going to be doing is i want to use a tool that can help me find uh find uh people that are relevant for me to connect with and then build a sequence of connecting with these people and then messaging them and uh there are two different tools that are uh popular for this or there are a lot of tools that do stuff like this one of them is called octopus the other is called prospectin and i'm going to be using prospect in as the example here and so with prospectin what i'm doing is i can build basically a scenario a sequence where multiple steps happen so for example step one being um i i'm going to view someone's profile step two being the next day i reach out to them to connect and i've got a message that's somewhat personalized for them and then if they connect with me then they're going to get a follow-up message saying like thanks for connecting i wanted to share with you this and so uh like tools like this can help with that and you can like build your own scenario like your workflow of of whatever you want it to be and so it could be something like uh if you really want to play the long game day one i'm going to view their profile and so if they're checking their linkedin they might get a notification your profile has been viewed by this person on day two i follow this person and day three i connect with this person um and you can do it however you like whatever you want in your process um but we also need to not just build this workflow but find people on linkedin and add them to our workflow and so how we do that is i'm going to go in linkedin and i'm going to do a search here for the type of business that i want to connect with and let's say i'm i want to reach out to lawyers prospectin and octopus also they have uh chrome extensions and chrome tools and um how it works it looks like it's not shown on this screen share but basically if i uh click on this prospecting tool here i can import all of the contacts from this search into my prospect in crm and then add them to a sequence and so then it'll happen automatically and that's how i can easily and quickly uh find a bunch of relevant or people in certain job roles however i want to break that down um and reach out to them and so i i prospecting is really easy octopus crm uh is also a good option as well next up i want to show a little bit about crm and email automation so for my crm so let's say you're getting you get replies to your outreach emails um you can generally either manage them all in your outreach software or if you have another crm that you're using for sales like uh pipedrive or salesforce you might want to bring those into you might want to bring these out these cold outreach leads to your crm and so for that uh what i've done is i use a zapier integration and i use it with my uh uh is that with my gmail so basically how i do it is if i get a response to my cold outreach email that response will go to my my g suite my regular gmail inbox but it will i'll also set a rule in my gmail so that outreach response gets a label and so i can make a trigger in zapier so that when i get when i have an email that uh has a label or has it has a label then i can add that uh basically add that contact to my crm and i use activecampaign for my crm whatever you use should be fine um and i'll automatically create like a new deal in my in my pipeline and so yeah whether you're using pipedrive or salesforce or anything else um the zapier workflow can easily work for that and so the effect of this um let's i just created this a few days ago and so i'm getting replies from my uh and just kind of built this pipeline so all right so whenever i get a new uh new response from my outreach emails i then get a new deal created in this crm and uh yeah basically uh that's that is uh how that works and so i can keep track of next up i want to share some tips and kind of best practices for all of this i know we kind of covered a lot about workflow but i also want to be kind of mindful of some things to be thinking about if you haven't really done outreach before um so one thing is outreach is a numbers game um if you're reaching out to five or ten people and you get no replies that sounds like it could be right because you might be getting uh a response rate of five percent or ten percent uh and not all the replies are going to be positive so we wanna be mindful that the more people that we're reaching out to the more wins we can be getting also just speaking from experience your first outreach campaigns will probably be bad uh but they will get better over time as you're figuring as you're seeing what people are responding to um and kind of seeing how that's all all shaking out but they will get better um and i like and one important thing that helps with this is testing um and so like you want to see what's working and what's not working like if people aren't opening your emails and just like a benchmark on our platform we're seeing on average just average in an open rate of emails around 40 for cold emails now um if you're seeing a lot less than that it could be an issue of either deliverability uh your emails are going to spam folders so there might be something to check out there or it might be that your subject line is just not compelling for the people that you're reaching out to um if you're not getting good replies um or you're not or seeing it you're seeing a low reply rate it might be either due to your prospecting is not good you're not finding the right people to connect with or it could very well be the email copy i'd probably put it more likely as the issue being the copy rather than prospecting um also it's important that with this as you're looking to scale it up to be very organized about this because when we get good leads we don't want them to fall through the cracks and that can happen um if you don't have like a plan in place for who on the team is going to be responding to our our leads here and who's me taking care of them and the last thing is follow-up a lot of people will craft an email and not be thinking about the follow-up so much but having an email sequence or a linkedin outreach sequence where that includes follow-ups is important because let's say you get a your response rate is like 10 and if you have one email that's ten percent but if you have two emails three emails four emails even if the follow-up emails are just something like hey just wanted to follow up and see what you thought that uh keeps the keeps the potential conversation going and gets it makes it much more likely that you get a reply lastly to recap some tools that i mentioned that i use um for prospecting i showed you hexamatic i showed you hrefs for seo and for like platforms i showed sparktoro and i showed postdaga for email outreach for linkedin i showed prospect in and for the integrations uh with the crm i shared zapier um last thing semi shameless self promotion if you're looking to check out something like postdogga for your email outreach um just email us at support postdoga.com and say you're from microcon for moat uh and i'll hook you up um that is basically all i got um hell i'm happy to do uh qna all right sir yeah we have questions pouring in so that that tells us the session was a good one so our first question is from esprit and she asks why not use hexamatic to source linkedin leads i personally have not done that um uh if you if it's if it works for you to do that you can do that um but from i guess from what i've found just if i'm using something specifically for linkedin like prospectin it has it built in so it's just easy enough for me to uh use their chrome extension and do a search and then click the button and prospecting will automatically add them to the crm and so that just makes it easy enough makes it easy for your process but it sounds like you you wouldn't be opposed to it if that was better better fit for for their workflow next question is i've done some cold email outreach before and wasn't getting any replies is cold outreach just not a good fit for some businesses so in my experience it's generally it's good for so if it's if your business is b2b it there generally should be opportunities for you um in particular if you're not getting replies um there are might on the top of my head there are a few things that it could be it could be your copy it's chances are my gut is it's probably the copy um i've i'm as i'm sure a lot of you have gotten cold sales emails that just you're like all right this isn't for me it's mostly the issue is the copy and i would workshop the copy um in particular being short is better uh being more gear basically really using the copy of your cold email to start a conversation rather than to list all the services you provide um is better and um but it also could be your prospecting is an issue um and i might see what you're getting for like open rates because if your open rates are low that is a giveaway that you're possibly ending up in spam folders right either subject line is bad or you're ending up in spam or promotions even right yeah they're you know in in my experience both personally and also with uh all the tiny seed and just companies micro anybody anybody who i talk to it's like there are still spaces where there are spaces um where cold email is kind of uh you know getting people getting burned out on it because they're hitting so much so i delete a lot of cold email um and and it because it has become more difficult there's still a bunch of spaces where that's not the case as well so i do think that it's it's industry to industry but also even within the industry it's is your subject line good and and are you making it to the inbox like i'm sure you probably get a lot of uh cold emails about like hey you're interested in b2b lead generation look at this we are doing b2b lead generation right now by reaching out to you to hire our company i get a lot of those where those emails are surprisingly bad which is like wait if that's bad why would i hire you no i totally get it um next question do you need sales navigator to use prospectin no um you do not all right um next question i've used other scrapers not hexamatic yet and they didn't work well for me do you recommend or know any no code tools for using those directory those directories apis instead i i guess i'm not sure about like i don't know what the scrapers are that that you have used and not found success with i i've tried a few different uh ones in particular like ones that are on like the absolute marketplace like i grabbed textile and hexamanic i got from uh from appsumo there was another one that i tried a while ago like connected actually no that wasn't a scraper but um yeah i've had it's been for me hit or miss with different scraping tools hexamatic i like a lot and that's why yeah why it's the one that i showed in particular just because i found it was the easiest and it just grabbed the information that i was looking for um but yeah i definitely had frustration with some other scraping tools because i'm not a coder the whole point of this is no code um so yeah and and the tough part is once you find one that works like hexamatic works for you you stop looking so you often don't you know you have a bunch that don't work and then you find one that works then you stop so it's you may not know uh some others we have another question about hexamatic does hexamatic work with google search results possibly following through each result to gather data from a site um i haven't used it for that um i don't see why it wouldn't yeah i would it would i would think it would but uh you might want to go to the hexamatic site and even email support um with that question because they should know that does postaga send from our own from my smtp google apps in my case of the question asker uh yes uh we have a specifically a an smtp integration with google apps so that you can send from your own email and if it's like a new email address that you're created just specifically for outreach like outreach at your company.com or something like that one thing that we also offer is which is included is warming up the email so that basically it sends a few emails emails on day one and then more emails over time to uh increase likelihood that you end up in the main inbox and not end up in spam because one thing that i've we've also seen some people do if they're starting out they're like all right great i've got a list of 10 000 sites let me just email all of them today and you just end up in spam permanently and on blacklist and stuff like that and so it's important when you're no matter what when you're doing outreach and if it's a fresh email address that you're warming it up so that it looks more natural and so that you won't get flagged a lot of people forget about that what are average results for outreach it average results it very much depends on it it depends on a lot it depends on what you're looking to do if you're looking for sales um you might see results so like two to five percent um if you're doing outreach for link building it could be like five to ten percent for replies um for podcast outreach uh i'm getting 20 um and so like it can yeah it varies wild wildly different but um i would say if you're talking about sales i would be kind of like my what i'd be shooting for like baseline would be five five percent in terms of replies what are some examples of subject lines that work well putting you totally putting you on the spot here so sure uh a general subject line that works well question followed by question mark that's the subject line um it it gets opens and provided that you're positing a question um whether it's you know sales or link building or anything like that um yeah it tends to work well um if it's sales also one thing i like is like insert company name question mark or um or company name with those little like brackets or less than minus then and my company name question mark something like that like like suggesting a partnership or something like that um that uh also i i found works pretty well yeah so there's some personalization sometimes a question uh mark the questions i have found that the questions need to be on point because i get ones with questions like need more b2b sas leads question mark and my answer is no i guess i don't you know it's like you're not targeting me well versus if they i don't know well you know you can imagine for me it's like want more youtube visitors or conference attendee or something at least i'd be like all right i'm gonna see what you i would at least click through and be like what is this person selling you know um last question sir and then we're gonna wrap how do i pitch to potential customers without it coming off as spammy great question um so i guess kind of the first thing i would do is well one you want to make sure that you've done your research and you've done your prospecting right and so that you know like so that your audience you're like all right i know what this what industry this person's in what space they're in and so i can have a pitch that's uh somewhat tailored to them um i'm sure you see like there are a lot of like cold sales pitches that are just like like i mentioned before just here are our services let us know if you need them and that's just not really engaging not really going to instill any confidence and so um typically i like to keep my sales emails i try to keep them relatively short but an example of something i do would be like hey insert person's first name um uh andy from postdogga here uh i i saw that you're in this space and wanted to see if you have this particular problem like are you having uh are you having trouble with this specif like a very specific problem that i i would think might be an issue for people in this particular segment and then if so i might be able to help um insert line about like my uh my company does this um if that's not if that's not a problem that you have totally cool but if so do you have seven minutes to talk uh this week let me know um and so i'm not selling them on the entirety of my business in this one email because really my goal for the email is to start a conversation um if i peak their curiosity and it's something that they're looking for they will respond but if i'm spending my time in the email just going through listing out my services my eyes are as a recipient are just gonna glaze over and like uh no i've i've seen this before and it doesn't seem like it's coming from a human being it's coming from a robot and so the right if right like humans write emails um you'll you'll have much better luck and really like we're just looking to start a conversation if they reply that's when you can share more salesy information or schedule a call to potentially sell them on your product but that's like if the goal here is to get them on a sales call um yeah just having a a a a single email that's like here are the things that we can provide here is a schedule here's my calendar link that's that's not go like that's not how people interact with with emails with humans yeah because email is a human to human endeavor yeah andy cabazo thank you so much for joining us today [Music] you
