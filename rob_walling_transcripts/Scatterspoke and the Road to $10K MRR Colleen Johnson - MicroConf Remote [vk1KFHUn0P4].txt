================================================================================

[Music] um we're going to dive into our second keynote of the day and if you recall our first keynote was from corinne pope and that was on that first stage of getting to launch and having that first sale the second keynote that we're about to roll into talks about the next milestone that many of you in uh in the crowd are trying to achieve it's 10k mrr it's the point at where a lot of us can go full time we're gonna hear from colleen johnson she's an enterprise agile coach a speaker a trainer an entrepreneur she's the co-founder and the ceo of scatterspoke colleen thank you so much for joining me on microconf remote today thanks for having me here rob excellent i'll let you take it from here from here all right thank you well i do want to disagree with you rob and we can settle this in the in the q a but i do think mall rats was probably one of the best movies ever made so i disagree with the 20 000 budget okay well let's dig in here so what is scatterspoke scattersbook is a tool for um for online retrospectives and it's it's built to help agile teams have um continuous feedback about how they're working so that they can have honest conversations about what things are working and what needs to improve and and make adjustments to their process along the way so when we think about retrospectives they typically look something like this what didn't go well what what went well what didn't go well what can we improve they're um usually done in a room where everybody's together with stickies on the wall and often done on a regular cadence and not for a lot of teams that are running scrum practices this is an every two week occurrence or at the end of each sprint you're reflecting back on the sprint and saying how did this work what can we change for teams that are running kanban or maybe longer running intervals they might do this monthly but it's a chance for the team to all come together and really have an honest conversation with each other so you might be thinking that's cool this is all cool why the hell would someone pay for this um which is a valid question um you know i think when from my experience and i've been in in the agile world for 10 years little over 10 years in the software industry for over 20 it sounds really straightforward get everybody together and get everybody talking but when you think about teams especially teams of software developers it can be very hard to get great honest feedback from people it can be even harder when you think about that interval of time between when something happens and when we get together to talk about it people forget um we want to sweep those emotions under the rug and not really have a you know have an honest conversation about what's going on um so it can be hard to feel like these are having any you know any actual impact on how we're working i think the other piece of this that that's really important when you think about the tool that we're providing to teams is that you can have the same conversation at every retrospective it can feel a little bit like groundhog's day probably dating myself with this movie reference too so you can end up having this same exact conversation where you're maybe talking about your you know issues with your ci cd pipeline or you're talking about issues with um with your qa efforts and wanting to move to automation but if you're doing this every two weeks and you're having the same conversation it's it's hard to feel like this is a productive use of anyone's time and what's worse is for a lot of organizations these these conversations are probably happening in with multiple small teams all at the same time everybody's talking about the same similar problems and we don't have a great way to connect the dots to see how we can improve those you know those pain points for the organization so like rob said this story isn't about the tool it's about the journey and how we got there um you are not mistaken that that first um image on our timeline here of our road to 10k is a coors light can so in 2015 my husband and i were hanging out one afternoon drinking coors light in the backyard and he said i really want um to learn more about how to build a real-time app so i want to learn node.js and angular and play around with and at the time i was moving into a consulting position and i was working with a lot of teams on how to build out a portfolio portfolio kanban system that would help them track things like how to do exploratory testing on problems and solutions with users before building things um and i said you know this sounds this sounds fun let's try let's try to build something and it felt like a great way for him to get his hands dirty with the technology he was interested in and for me to really put my money where my where my mouth was i was teaching other teams how to do these things but had never built something on my own so it was really started with an opportunity to learn i knew the agile space really well and so i knew that there was this need for a way to have a retrospective where people could provide feedback anonymously and not be tied to the comments they were putting up on the stickies and then the other problem i kept seeing was that um in clients i was working with they would um constantly reschedule their their retrospectives especially if they were on a friday and people were out or they were down to the wire on a sprint deadline it was the first meeting to always get pushed off so i wanted to figure out how could we um how could we build something and test out you know these new technologies how could we build something i could use so it was very selfish that i could use with my clients to help make these retrospectives a better experience for for the teams um so sat around drank a bunch of coors light did exactly what corinne said and hopped on and tried to buy a domain and then we did the very important next step of purchasing a shitload of stickers and then nothing happened so i got really focused on consulting um and used you know i continued to use the tool from my coaching perspective my husband john continued to tinker with it and play around with different technologies but we really didn't do a whole lot with the tool for about a year it was really cool because it was an opportunity for me to keep using it with people in here real-time feedback and i would come home with that and say you know people want to be able to vote or want to be able to group on items or create an action item and so we were slowly adding new things but never still never really had the intent of turning this into an actual business it was still just something that was for both of us both of us to learn how to how to put all of this into practice so the next step for us um around 2017 um was actually we started to see that using our google analytics that we had a fair amount of of people coming to the site we that was all we could track we didn't have the concept of a user so we said why don't we go ahead and create a simple way to register before you can access the boards still everything was completely free there was you know no charges or credit cards or subscriptions or anything at that point it was just a way to collect email addresses um and i was the one that was very reluctant to have any kind of user registration for the longest time i wanted to make sure that this was simple to use i was very scared that if we made it harder to you know if we made it harder to get in and use the tool quickly that people would just stop using it and what we found was quite the opposite we just saw the the number of registered users going up and up and up in 2017. we closed 2017 out with about 12 000 users and um what was really funny when current was talking about feedback was that year we also installed drift so that we could look so we could start to communicate with people if they were having issues if they had feedback like curran said um we had some really rough feedback there for a while probably one of the funniest moments i think was like her campfire story we were sitting around and had somebody pop on and say um your ui looks like it looks like it was built by a drunk intern we had some fun moments that that were a little painful but that combination in 2017 of creating a user account and being able to communicate with users and track users and then also have drift on the site so we were getting feedback and understanding what problems they were running into kind of changed everything for us um the funny part about having drift on there was towards the end of 2017 we had somebody pop on drift and um it was kind of creepy at first they were looking for me specifically and invited me to come speak at a big agile conference in brussels belgium in 2018. so we got super excited and we saw this as a way um to launch a new version of the site that would start to charge and we used that experience of keynoting and being on stage in brussels is kind of this kicking off point so that was in february of 2018 so we spent really like the entire holiday season leading up to that trying to get a complete redesign of the site up with new logos new just a completely brand new um interface that we ended up launching alongside that agile conference in belgium so we started charging and we kept the free version but we always we made it we made some of the other features basically um subscription only and um when we when we launched all of this we were pretty close to 20 000 registered users and we started to see some small conversions um i think at that time you know it was like just as many people that would subscribe would cancel a month later so we were still missing something and we were continuing to communicate with people through drift get feedback about the tool um and really start to understand what things were missing i would say around the same time in 2018 we saw a ton of other retrospectives tools start to enter the market and charge so it was kind of validating for us that this was this was something that could become an actual business because we were starting to see some competition we were also pretty excited around you know the competition that was coming into the space took a very different approach to retrospectives than what we were doing and so it gave us kind of a unique a uniqueness in the industry so in 2018 we kind of we saw a lot of use usage go up new accounts coming in um started to see some of those convert but it wasn't like we were going to quit our day jobs anytime soon it was still very slow growth and then um in 2019 i think we were both starting to feel like um we were i think we were both just distracted to be honest um i was leaving my consulting career and starting my own consulting business my husband was working for um a big uh cryptocurrency exchange and so we were both kind of getting focused in very different places and i think feeling a little bit like this just wasn't gonna work especially not on nights and weekends um and all of the sudden we got a request from a huge company that wanted to buy 2 000 licenses um and we were like oh my god what's happening where is this coming from um this is never you know we didn't really even know how to do enterprise pricing we were googling for enterprise contracts we didn't have a lawyer we didn't have you know we just really were not ready to do any of this but super it like reinvigorated all of our energy around trying to make this into an amazing business um so we went down the path of contract negotiation with this big company um to get them set up with 2000 licenses and a big part of that was we just didn't have a lot of um infrastructure in place to support a large organization yet so we had to build out like an admin portal to manage teams and accounts we had to build out single sign-on we had all of these things that this company wanted us to build as part of this contract that was actually in a lot of ways forcing us to an actual product market fit that we just didn't have before i think it was it was a cool way for us to learn and experiment in both of our areas of expertise but for up until this point in time a lot of what we were doing was was playing um i would get ideas and want to try something john would get ideas and want to try something different and so um until we have this big enterprise deal staring staring us down um with all these custom requests it really helped us see what do we need uh to sell into these large organizations going forward so i think we didn't really find our product market fit until just last year so going in to this year so we are part of the 2020 tiny seed cohort and we've had a bunch of of great things happen this year so we've been able to focus on on this business full time now we have been able to invest in marketing which we had never spent any money on in the past we've gone down the road of getting a lot of security things shored up that we hadn't done in the past and we're on track to close two more large enterprise deals this year we've closed three smaller enterprise deals since coming on um or since the beginning of 2020 so we're on track to hit uh 10k mrr hopefully next month and expect to close those two enterprise deals before the year is over and that will pretty much double where we're at in terms of mrr so we're super excited this path has been kind of a crazy road for us of um a lot of ups and downs and it was interesting to hear sherry talk because i was thinking about some of that emotional rollercoaster that you feel of um being super excited and having a ton of wind in your sails and having that totally knocked out of you um you know a couple days later it is a lot of ups and downs but we feel like now we're really on this great trajectory and a lot of that came from landing that big enterprise deal that helped us sort out um what do big companies want and what do they need and for our particular sas model um that's that's the bus that's the sale that we want to go after we want to really target these large enterprises there's a lot of easy ways and other free tools available that are in our space for small teams but there's not a lot available that helps big organizations connect these problems across the organization the way that scattersbook does so we're super excited that's everything i've got oh one more um and that's what's what's next for us so going into 2021 we're continuing to focus on these large enterprises and really trying to find alignment with some different agile frameworks things like scaled agile um there's a couple new players in the market around different frameworks for organizations going through transformation efforts um another big focus for us going into 2021 is integrations so we're we've already got thing we've got integrations with slack and with jira we're going to focus heavily on adding a lot more integrations to that list going into next year and continuing to target these these big enterprise contracts that's everything i've got that's our road to 10k mrr we'll go ahead and kick it back to you rob all right thank you so much colleen we are going to have um some audience questions coming through and before we do that i have a couple for you so i appreciate your thoughts on mall rats however so kevin smith's first film was clerks and it was a black and white film that he made for like 25k of credit card debt yeah and so i i own i'm like the the comic book nerds who i own i think they call the unholy trilogy right mall rats chasing amy and uh and dogma um and he's another one that like didn't ask for permission you know and he went off and started his own podcast network because he got tired of cow towing to uh to hollywood so all right what was the budget from all rats i think it was a quarter million dollars oh yeah it was pretty small no no that's actually incorrect maul rats was like five or six million and he didn't like having so much money because he had to blow it and then he when he came back to make chasing amy he made it for a quarter million dollars and that was again it was like he preferred to be that scrappy bootstrapper to not be on the hook for that huge budget and feel all the pressure it's kind of like raising venture capital right you raise one million versus yeah you know your bootstrap or you raise 100k it's like such a different such a different game have you seen clerks yes definitely i've seen them what are you doing what do you like rats or clerks i like moderates better than clerks but dogma is definitely my favorite yeah yeah i think mine too uh producer xander can i get a little more of colleen in my monitor i'm having trouble hearing her a little bit all right so i'm curious um oh we have awesome i was gonna start asking you my questions but i'd love to get live questions from the audience so first question from james mcbrian he says what were the key changes that opened up the enterprise pipeline for you you know i'm i don't know if i have a really solid answer here we um i think starting to so i started really doing a lot of public speaking in 2017 and speaking at conferences we had still until this year haven't spent any money on advertising that includes even just google adwords um so all of our users and all of our traffic came from um presenting at conferences word of mouth people seeing reviews on different networks um or hearing other you know other coaches or scrum masters talking about what do you use for retros um so i think a lot of what opened up that opportunity for us enterprise-wise has been um these tight-knit communities and karen talked about this too of like finding your audience finding who are the people that are the ones going to search for a tool so that you can really target having a presence in that in that space and so for us that's a lot of things linkedin is like facebook fragile coaches it's kind of funny um and then there's a lot of different forums that are very specific to agile practices and how to run great retros where we've made sure that we are our voices heard in those forms too so i people just have found us through things like that very cool and i'm curious um you talked about the competition that started springing up and charging in uh well i can't see your slide but i forget if it was 20 17 or 18 time frame was that you mentioned it was motivating um was it also intimidating a bit or was it only positive for you oh my god it's still intimidating it's that that hasn't gone away and i think i you know it's been it's been interesting because we came out with like 39 a month plan and then we dropped it to 29 and then we dropped it to 25 and at one point you know before we signed that big contract we were like let's just make it 19 a month we've been all over the place in terms of what took a charge and what does that include um and even just pushed out some new changes in april around our pricing um i think that's been a good lesson and part of the tiny seed mentor program is that's okay and that's a normal kind of journey for a startup to take is to continue to play around with that pricing but um we spent a lot of time initially looking at our competitors and saying what do we have that they have or what do they have that we don't have and how do we price according to to what they've got um i think not until this year would i say that we've gotten to the point where we don't care we don't care what they have or what they're charging i think we have a pretty good understanding of what we offer and what the value there is um especially knowing that it's an enterprise that's paying for it right it's not it's not often somebody pulling out their own credit card um to pay for our tool so knowing that we're yeah keep going keep going with that yeah so knowing that it's like a big enterprise that's writing a check for an entire year of service or license seats it's kind of changed our approach to what we charge and i think that that's given us a little bit more confidence in where we're at now and i think more flexibility in continuing to change it going forward yeah and that's such a big i mean part of the key part of what you just said is you used to be really concerned about what your competitors were pricing and how they were arranging that and now you're kind of confident that you're doing the right thing based on your customers that's such a part of product market fit that people don't realize or don't talk about is once you have the confidence in um in what you're doing and what the feedback you're getting and it's just working and you're signing these big deals that is again a component of you know what i would i would call product market fit because until you're starting to feel decent about your pricing i don't i don't think that you have that yeah yeah and it's hard to i think it's hard you know we even had a huge company come to us at one point and ask for a quote for an enterprise contract when we provided them a number um the person on the on the phone was like i don't understand how you can charge that much it's just a whiteboard tool like it's just sticky notes and so we you know we got defensive i think initially and we were like oh no but here's all the other things that could do and here's how it's useful and then it was like you know what um thank you for your feedback and you know explore other options and if you change your mind come back to us um so it's it's hard the pricing game is a hard one to i think find find that groove and feel confident like you said that that what you're offering matches up with what you're charging yep yeah it's so easy to be so fragile it's like um yeah it's like your feelings or your ego are tied up in it i mean every time i've launched a new product or service or conference or accelerator or anything it's just the first like five conversations you have when people don't like it you're like oh no this is never gonna work we can't possibly make this work but you know obviously obviously you do because you're on the road to 10k here we have a question from dominic taylor and he says how do you know when to leave the day job how do you think about that weighing that you know that because we all have responsibilities and everything yeah it's super hard i mean um actually joining tiny seed was the catalyst for us to be able to make that happen um i had i had branched off and started doing consulting you know under my own business uh about two years ago and that really helped me make the jump into making scatterspoke our full-time you know our full-time business so we started to tiptoe into other ways i think to supplement income to get us there and now my husband's full-time on this as well but it's it's hard i mean i think that there's there's all these things right of understanding what your threshold is feeling like you have enough sucked away in case things don't work out for a couple months i mean for i would say up until 2019 we were spending more just on like hosting and emailing services than we were ever making on the tool so it's been pretty new to be even marginally profitable let alone to the point where we could thinking about supporting our family this way so taking the tiny seed investment definitely helped us get there even though we've been spending that on other things as well but i think there's a lot of personal factors that go into that around what your threshold is for for risk and what does your day job look like right i mean that was a big factor for me of um you know at any time i can jump back into coaching and teaching and helping helping agile teams and so i think you also have to weigh what the climate looks like for the industry that you're in so that if you need to if you need to go back that option's on the table yeah i think that's a good way to think about it i mean i think the there's probably three or four cases where i think of people leaving or the road to leaving the day job one is and i know i have friends and colleagues who've done exactly these one is you save up enough money that you don't need to work for 18 months and then you try to do it and that's a little scary and most people can't do it but that's one way another is to raise a small amount of funding to cover yourself for the 12 to 18 months another is to spare step your way up and either use products other products or use consulting to kind of transition that and the fourth one really is to have a partner you know a supportive partner who's kind of willing to support you during that so it's figuring out other streams of revenue um to do it and then knowing your own you know some people are willing the story of like customer.io they had almost no revenue and they like both quit their day jobs and that would freak me the hell out like i didn't do i mean i had eight grand a month coming in before i quit my day job and it was enough to cover the mortgage and all the stuff and that i think it just depends on maybe risk tolerance you know yeah and i think that's compounded right when it's a husband and wife um founder situation because it's like if this fails we're both out of a job so there's some interesting pressure added by that absolutely all right another question from george i nikolev he says what was it was a tough one actually i'm curious to hear you take what was the key to nailing down product market fit for you um honestly listening you know i think this is i think one of the things that's been kind of challenging in in building this product is i am super close to the users and super i am the demographic right that we're sewing too so i get excited and i get all these ideas about things that i want to build and that i want to do and that i want to see um and i think when we go down that path often especially you know i get excited about the features my husband gets excited about the technology and starts building all these things and you know it takes us then we end up with like a six month release which is not really very agile when you think about it's not what we coach other people to do um we build these huge releases that take forever to get out the door and we're doing you know a hail mary once we put those out to find out if stuff that people like um and honestly like production is the most expensive place you can test out an idea so one of the things that i think has really helped us is not building so much stuff until people ask for it and that that enterprise deal that we got at the beginning of 2018 really set us up for we had to shelve a bunch of stuff that we were excited to build and listen to what they wanted us to add to the tool in order to support a 2000 person organization and that you know it kind of changed things for us and also helped us going forward with other contracts so now when we go to the table and start to work with these large enterprises one of the first things we ask is are there things that aren't in the tool that you're interested in having added to the tool and even if it's you know we've had we have a recent one that was a laundry list of stuff and when we came to them with a price to add it all they said just add this one thing um but now we have a you know we have a whole backlog of other things they'd like to see added that are probably things other organizations want added to so a big part of it i think is just been listening like finding who who's our optimal customer and listening to their needs yep very nice all right a reminder to folks in uh in remote um click the question button and submit your own question if you have any questions for colleen we have almost another five minutes to go i have another question um this one from jack dempsey how have you navigated the challenges of being married to your co-founder any tactics strategies or principle to help principals to help make this work well lots more coors light clearly we're in colorado so that helps um no in all honesty i think some of the things that we've really figured out help us are um things that i think would help any co-found like co-founders we try to um we use jira for our work we have a kanban board where we track priorities we use that with our contractors um whether it's marketing folks now or dev folks we try to communicate in slack a lot even though we're sitting usually two feet apart from each other so we use slack for everything so that we can see what each other's communicating especially when it's like third-party contractors so that i know if he's told the developer you don't have to build this thing that way i don't yell at them later and then we also block off times we block off different times during the week where we either look at the backlog together we look at our metrics together um because i think it can be like we both get like i said we both get excited about the things that we're passionate about and kind of go down different paths and we've we've had that bite us in the ass before where we're both going so far away from what each other's working on because we assume we're go you know we assume because we're in the same house we're going down the same road and and we're not and so we try to um going into this year set up some more regular check-ins where we're making sure that we're working together on the same things and our priorities are lining up um and then the kids aren't there we have three kids so it's it's chaos here right now with kids being home from school and daycare's being closed so um it's i think that makes it even more important to carve out specific time to take care of those tasks on a regular basis sounds like lots of communication yeah we have a question from hector de pareda and he says how do you decide to target small business smaller medium-sized businesses versus big corporations as a bootstrapped company in your experience which are the pros and cons of each um so for us i think we still target those small small to medium businesses and we we have a lot of them using the tool now and i would say a lot of those kind of tend to sit in the like hundred user seat type of bucket um the organization might be bigger but it tends to be like 100 licenses that they're looking for um and they're awesome to work with we get a ton of feedback from them i think you know we're getting to the point now where we've got a few small small medium sized businesses where we can kind of experiment with them so like we're we're pushing out a beta version of a canvas board that's more like a white board um where you can post things and they're not in columns and it'll still pull all that you know pull all of that back into our analytics and um we can push that now out to some of these smaller businesses and and test it with them and get feedback from them and that's a cool relationship to have that i think would be a little harder to do when there's two that you know two thousand users um but for us you know a lot of uh and and they tend to onboard quicker i would say that's the other piece with small to medium business businesses is it's pretty self-service they can kick that off there's not a long contract so we love that part of it it's kind of instant revenue enterprises tend to take a long time i mean these can be like up to six months of back and forth legal security reviews um but once we do finally close those i mean it like like i said it'll two enterprise deals doubles our mmr where we're at right now so um i think that's the other part that's kind of you know from uh from a focused perspective we want to keep focusing on these enterprise deals because they're they're a lot more lucrative and then they're usually a year-long contract if three so that tends to be another piece that these big companies want to buy a tool for for like a three-year minimum um so once we go through the long road to get there we're really locked into that revenue a decent amount of time yeah i think that's good perspective i mean the sales cycles are really long with enterprise but man the churn is just they don't want to change unless there's a real problem they sign these long and there's this other thing i'll say versus going after small medium versus enterprise is if you can build a business that actually has a i call it a dual funnel where you have people coming in paying a low price and high volume and you can build up like a nice brand but then you also have the enterprises coming in that's an amazing business those are the ones i see growing the fastest so drip was like that where we had a 50 starter plan but we had people coming in paying us a thousand dollars a month when they had a huge list uh squad cast who we'll hear from a little later you know it's podcast recording and they of course have the fly fisherman who's paying them 15 a month and then you might have a huge you know uh you can imagine like a podcast network coming in and paying them thousands a those funnels are really quite amazing so all right colleen thank you so much we're at time i really appreciate you coming on to microcomp remote today yeah thank you for having me this was great you
