[Music] hello hey Micra calm how's it going so I'm super excited to talk to you I can't wait to get started but before I do I want to do something a little bit weird so would you please at the very instant when my hands come together like this would you please all clap at that exact same time we're trying for a synchronized claps let's try it real quick everybody falls to that one don't feel too bad so this talk is consists of three stories these are three true stories that happen to me recently and the lessons that I learned because of them the first story is about a pivotal moment so two months ago I created a brand new business with a good friend of mine I flew to Austin Texas we rented an Airbnb and we coated our faces off for four days straight and after those four days we realized we were ready to bring in our first paying customers so we were very ruthless about our MVP we kept it very simple and we're both pretty experienced programmers so we were able to launch quite quickly and we were getting all set to email our list and say here's the sign-up link let us know what you think but on a whim I decided what if what if we just onboard a couple people manually while they were sharing their screen with us just so I can double-check and make sure that this onboarding flow that I had created was in fact as awesome as I thought it was now I suggested this literally thinking that this would mostly just be a confirmation of how great a job we had done on the UI because I had worked pretty hard on it and I had been very clear and written a lot of text and I thought I did well so we set up six calls in one day 30-minute call one-hour break 30-minute call one-hour break all day all people who had never seen the product but said they were interested in signing up and during that first call I had an experience that I think changed me forever in the way that I build software for other people and the experience I had was I watched a stranger sign up for and try to use my product while I watched and it turns out that you can't evaluate your own product you cannot know if it's easy to use yourself because you know it's too well everything I thought was totally clear was not if this person had not been on a call with me there's no way they would have made it through the onboarding they would not have become a customer and this by the way was not a non-technical person I wasn't like misjudging how technical our users were this is another developer but it's still our onboarding did not make sense to him and so after that first call I said to my co-founder I said Chris I just took four pages of notes we have to fix some of this before the next call and so we coded as fast as we could and for 57 minutes and then three minutes before the next call we pushed a brand new version out to production which is definitely a best practice that all of you should adopt I highly recommend pushing brand-new versions of your app right before importing demos write that one down crack please and so the second call the good news was we had not introduced any major bugs nothing blew up the bad news was we didn't actually improve the onboarding all the stuff that we had fixed that we thought would make a difference did not and that's when I learned that it's also hard to evaluate if you're making progress until you actually watch a user go through the new flow after the second call we had a little more luck we made some different changes and made some different tweaks and reordered some things and suddenly the third call went a lot better I got fewer questions it took less time things made sense to them and the fourth fifth and sixth calls with each one was better than the previous and so there are a couple takeaways I'd like you to have from this very first story the first of which is if you have not watched a stranger sign up for and try to use your product you absolutely must do this and you're going to cry it's going to be unbelievably painful I promise you you do not know the weird bugs that people are hitting and your flow you do not know how ridiculous your site looks in Firefox on Linux like you don't know that your site doesn't work with the password manager they happen to use there's so many little edge cases and interesting things and parts that you thought were totally clear that are actually not clear and so I promise you you will cry at the money you have left on the tape the good news is I have two pieces of good news the first is that you actually don't need to spend a huge amount of time on this because three or four users will show you the biggest problems the biggest problems will become clear fairly quickly and additionally though things you can do to fix them are actually usually somewhat simple so Chris and I had really great luck we had the most leverage from making sure that two things were correct on each page and very clear one was the page title the h1 and the other was the button text because when a Newport when a person it's a new page they will usually read the title and they will usually read a button before they click in usually so this brings me to my next story because while people do read those two things they do not tend to read much of your copy so this story is about a question so the business that I launched that I've been talking about is called briefs it's a little bit like audio Twitter it's for making podcasts where each episode is limited to three minutes and so as part of the signup flow we'd ask people three questions what's the title of your podcast what's the description of it and what cover are would you like to use and in my mind this was going to be the easiest screen and the onboarding I expected no problems on this but can anyone guess the question that I got from nearly everyone that hit this page can I change it later that's what everyone asks can I can I change these settings later and so I would say ah I heard that a question a couple times I said I know this is an objection and the way you deal with objections is you write some micro copy and so I wrote a line beneath the title of the page that said don't worry you can change these settings later and I on boarded a couple more people and I got the same question continually people would miss it people would ask me can I change this later with their mouse partially obscuring the sentence that said don't worry you can change this later this is this is true I added it again so I said maybe I'll just double it if I put it on there twice people will see it I'll put it above the submit button didn't work people missed it and then I said ah I will be a clever UX ninja I'm gonna put it as the placeholder text inside the form fields so that when you see podcast title the next thing you see right as two it is you can change this later it now said it beneath the title and then three times one for each field I promise I swear this is true people would still ask me can I change this later this by the way is a problem I would not have known if I hadn't been on boarding these people but so at that point I stepped back and said okay I could pull out all the stops and eventually make this thing so unmissable that people will stop asking me this but what's the core problem here the core problem is anxiety I'm asking people to name their podcast the last thing that most people were asked to name was their child right this is like it feels like a big decision and so I decided instead I ask myself what if we just defaulted this I know from a previous step that this person's name is Mary Smith why don't I just call it Mary Smith podcast put it a reasonable default description and give them some some plain cover art and just rip this page right out of the onboarding flow get them to success quicker and reduce that anxiety because there's something weird in human psyche people do not have the same amount of anxiety around editing something that already exists if you ask them to create something fresh it feels scary it is less scary to edit something that's already there don't know why it just seems to be how we're wired so my takeaways from this these two stories are defaults are great if at any point in your onboarding flow you can just default something in I highly recommend you do it and the second thing is people skim you are writing copy on your pages and explanatory things and you think people are reading this and when you watch them use your app you will discover they are absolutely not people scream skim aggressively they want to read as few words as possible to get the job done if the text isn't in their way or they're not stuck they're not going to read and you'll see this born out if you if you do this testing so this brings me to my very last story now this is micro comm so I feel like I would be remiss if I didn't talk at least a little bit about money so as I was doing these calls I would be on a Google hangout with people and my co-founder will be sitting in a kitchen table out of sight with his laptop open listening and often this was in the very early days our pricing page was not public we were telling people a rough range of what we expected to charge for the plans but we didn't have the pricing anywhere public and so on the calls I would say by the way what are you expecting to pay for this and they would throw out a number and usually we were roughly right in line but sometimes they would say a number that was like twice as much as we were planning on charging them and I was like oh this is opportunity we're leaving money on the table by charge his people less than they're willing to pay and so we said would it be possible to write our app in such a way that we could change our pricing so fast that when they tell me they're willing to pay extra on the call we can change it in 30 seconds before that we even get to the pricing page and the answer is yes so you can do this and we did do this so the way we deploy to Heroku and we set our striped plan names and dollar amounts with Heroku environment variables which you can change without deploying any new code now we never ended up doing that little thing where we like would change the price right before someone got there I felt a little bit scammy but what we did use this for is to experiment like crazy so Patrick was up here yesterday telling us we should be experimenting with our pricing and changing it every three to six months but if you know it's gonna take you a week to try to a new pricing point you're probably just gonna not do it right like if it's just a pain you're probably just gonna push it off I think of this a little bit like the gym clothes thing or if you want to go to the gym in the morning it's a real good idea to put the gym clothes out ahead of time and pack the bag and get everything all set up as it should be because when the thing that you know you should do is easier you do it more even though you know you should be doing it so I would encourage you to ask yourself how long would it take me to change my prices if I started right now I would not be shocked to learn that there are many of you in this room where the answer would be about a week I would not be shocked to learn that three days maybe I guess is the medium would be about two days in this room if we actually looked at it I would encourage you to get to the point where you can change your prices without deploying code that's how you know you've got it I changed my prices with a single line in the terminal it takes me 10 seconds so I think it'd be awesome if you could get there too so that is my talk those are my three stories I hope this has been useful for you and if not you can always change this later [Applause] you
