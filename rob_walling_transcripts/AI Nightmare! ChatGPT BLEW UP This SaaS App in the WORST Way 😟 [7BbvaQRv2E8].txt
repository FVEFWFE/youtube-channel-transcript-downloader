please do not trust the nonsense that chat GPT spits out that's a quote from Ed Frey Fogle he's the co-founder of open cage he posted that on Twitter as well as a slack group I'm part of and made it to the top of Hacker News he talks about how chat GPT has been telling people that open cage provides a service they don't and even giving them code to hit their API to perform phone lookups but the thing is they've never offered this service and so now they're getting dozens of angry signups per day wondering why their API is broken we all think chat GPT is pretty amazing in this video we're going to take a look at one of the downsides of AI I'm Rob Walling a Serial entrepreneur I've written four books on building startups and I've invested in more than 125 companies opencage is a geocoding API meaning you can put things into it like an address and get the latitude and longitude you can put in latitude longitude get addresses back and all manner of things in between but a couple months ago chat GPT started recommending opencage for a service they don't offer for this phone lookup service and it's gotten so bad that they published a blog post called don't believe chat GPT we do not offer a phone lookup service so back in January opencage started receiving a few customers a trickle in their sign up flow in January and how did you hear about us was chat GPT and they thought that's great the problem was many of these new users were using their free trial for a handful of API requests and then they would stop completely and in fact a lot of them started saying it didn't work or something was broken which of course was very concerning for these Founders as they investigated they realized chat gbt is incorrectly recommending them for a reverse phone number lookup in other words the ability to determine the location of a mobile phone solely based on the number so this is not a service they provide and it's not a service that you could really build and this is incredibly privacy invasive you would need to be a cell phone carrier in order to provide this data so it's not something they can even take advantage of one of the co-founders of opencage is an investor in tinyseed and so he had posted in the tiny scene slack about this and folks were chiming in with will you have this traffic now shouldn't you just build this API endpoint not realizing the Privacy implications and frankly the implausibility of building an API endpoint like this and the crazy part is it's not just that chat gbt is recommending them for the service but they are writing code to allow you to hit a non-existent API endpoint it all looks very believable you might be wondering why would chat GPT recommend opencage if they don't have this API endpoint well it turns out that there were some YouTube videos published over the past few years that referred to open cages being able to do it and so obviously chat GPT has pulled that false information into their brain and when you ask about doing this reverse phone lookup they're spitting out full API code for an API endpoint that doesn't exist and an interesting thing that opencage points out in their blog post which at the bottom they note was written by a human not by AI is that we as humans and people on the internet have learned to become skeptical of advice given by other humans so if you're watching a video course you sometimes take it with a grain of salt but we feel like searching Google asking chat GPT are going to give us these unequivocal positive and true results and that's not the case I think many of us have stumbled upon this while using Chad GPT another example that's interesting is I typed in tell me about Rob Walling and the first summary that chat GPT spit out was pretty much 100 accurate talks about me being an entrepreneur an investor an author it talks about companies I've started who acquired us talks about companies I've started companies I've sold as well as some of the books I've written but when I click regenerate request it gives information that is just incorrect it says things like he's an angel investor and has invested in several startups including barometrics user input and tinyseed I haven't invested in Bear metrics I've never heard of user input and tinyseed is a company I started I did an angel invest in it in addition in this same response it says Rob Walling is also a prolific author talks about start small stay small which is my first book and it says I wrote The Lean entrepreneur how to build a successful business using the principles of lean development which I'm pretty sure is a real book but I didn't write it by now hopefully most of us know that chat GPT and frankly all of the AI chat should be taken with a grain of salt they have incorrect results just like a Google search might have incorrect results you might search for a recipe for an old fashioned and maybe the 6th or the seventh row isn't actually an old-fashioned maybe it's a different variation of it or it's just it's either a mistake or it's just a ranking that isn't exactly your query and we're used to that with search but we're not used to it with AI yet so for those of us using it the first thing you should do is take all AI generated content with a grain of salt the second thing and it's something that AI providers are starting to do is to provide references for their data and that's something that happens so well in the Googles of today is when you search for it and you see a snippet or you see a summary of a web page you see the URL right there and that's the reference built in right if it's coming from CNN or the BBC you can assume it's a reputable news source if it's coming from news dash of Dash the dash day dot Biz you're probably going to want to take that with a grain of salt so that's a signal right it's a reference and the more that AI can Surface what they're referencing as they create this content the better off all of us will be so I certainly wish the best to the open cage team I know they've been struggling with people being angry higher support load negative reviews and there's really no way to get around this who do you report this to it's not like you can tell openai to regenerate their whole Corpus because they have a mistake in one of their results so I definitely wish them the best as they tried to clean up this mess recover from it and move on we'll link up the Tweet the blog post and The Hacker News Post in the description of this video If you enjoyed it hope you hit the like button and
