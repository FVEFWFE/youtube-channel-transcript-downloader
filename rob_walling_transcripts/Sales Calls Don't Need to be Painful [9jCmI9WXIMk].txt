I know it sounds absurd but we sell software or guys that installed kitchen countertops I know a lot of you think it's crazy or maybe terrifying to do sales calls on the phone but what I want to tell you is how we do that we actually talk on the phone to all of our prospects and customers so why should you listen to me I'm I don't think of myself as a Salesman I'm an engineer at heart I'm not super excited to be talking on the phone every day but it's so incredibly valuable for our company that I'm okay with it so we've been doing this like Rob said over a decade and I've learned a few things especially about sales so we started our company in 2003 and then there was this thing called the housing crash and we changed to selling software as a service in 2009 which was the best thing we ever did but that's a whole different talk here's a chart of our monthly revenue at this point we do a couple million dollars in sales we keep growing our revenue in a pretty steady rate but we're trying to keep our company as small as possible so there's seven of us set more we're three of us including me do customer support and none of us are full-time salespeople so I'm the most sales you guide our company and I'll probably on a typical day have three sales conversations but a hundred percent of our customers talk to us before they buy so there's a couple of reasons that works for us and why it's incredibly valuable I don't know if I actually have to point this thing but so our price point makes it possible to have that conversation on the phone our lowest price product is 50 bucks per month per user some of our customers pay us over a thousand dollars a month and on average people pass about 200 bucks a month are so our customers sell kitchen countertops so they're not super technically savvy maybe they bought something like QuickBooks or a CAD program before but in general we need to educate them about software and make sure they're successful because if they're successful then they stay with us forever so when we are first getting started people would hear about us that a tradeshow read about us in a magazine something like that and call us up and ask for a demo and we'd give them a demo and we'd show them feature after feature after feature over the course of an hour sometimes more but what we discovered is something was missing some of those people some of those demos they never talk to us again other people would avoid us for months and some people would just give us money and we had no idea why like zero no idea so what we discovered with a lot of help from other people is that the demo our customers wanted was not actually what they needed now over time what we've learned is that we can use that demo as an excuse to have a conversation about their business and as we're digging in on their business problems we give them a chance to sell themselves on our software we can explain whether or not it's a good fit for them and we tell them how to get started because having that conversation is so important we want a consistent and meaningful we actually had to build a sales process now before you think I'm mr. process you should know in real life I am actually mr. half-ass you can ask Ted he's here too but because having that consistency is so important the best way to do it is by doing that consistently so here's our whole process first we're gonna have a conversation with you and understand your business then I'm going to show you our software and we're actually going to talk about things that solve your business problems and finally we're going to discuss what it takes to get started so I'll talk about each one of those in a little more detail so if you're only gonna remember one thing from this whole talk this is it this is how we understand our customers business we have four questions and over the years we've figured out different ways to ask these questions but this is really the core what are you doing today what works about that what doesn't and what's the consequence of not changing so for example I might ask how are you scheduling countertop jobs today and then the hardest thing in the world is to just shut up and let them tell me I've literally talked to thousands of countertop shops so as of this morning 1957 and I know there's only two answers they're gonna give me but that is not the point as they're describing what they do now what works about that what doesn't and what's the consequence of not changing they're the ones describing the value of our software not me they're the ones making the sale so here's some other ways that we ask those questions can you give me an example of that it has that been happening long what's a ballpark of what that costs the whole idea is to make it easy for them to answer what are they doing now what works about it what doesn't and what's the consequence of not changing after we understand our customers business problems then we can actually show them a demo that's short and highlights the points they care about so remember how our software demos used to take an hour sometimes more I've seen hour-long software demos and they suck what's important is before you fall asleep I need to show you how our software lets you keep the things that work about your business and fixes the things that are broken and at every opportunity during this demo we want to keep turning it around and asking more probing questions and keep that conversation going so for example here's our calendar you said this kind of looks like the whiteboard you have in your office today how are you scheduling things when a customer changes their appointment from Tuesday to Wednesday what works about that what doesn't what's the consequence of not changing so after we've shown how our demo our software can actually solve their business problems then it's time to wrap things up and so traditionally you might think of this as closing the deal but actually for us much more important is adding a dose of reality about getting started what we found is that that whole sought of that whole process of having that conversation is trying to figure out if what we do is a good fit for our customers and we actually call that always be leaving and I did not include a slide of Alec Baldwin so it's okay to say no to people who are not a good fit for your software so what's really important is I need to make sure that people are successfully implemented because then they're going to give us money long term and so we explained during the sales process that they need uninterrupted time and we explain the steps of getting started we also I guess maybe as salesy as I get is something like if you're ready to get started today all we need is a credit card and about half an hour you'll get an email from us and then we'll call you tomorrow make sure you got everything and we're also going to schedule support calls ahead of time and then what's really cool is what happens next most of the time this ends in a sale and I didn't really have to be obnoxious or aggressive about it the whole point is we built this process in a way where it's obvious what the next step should be it's more expensive not to buy our software than it is to buy it so like I said before it's really important for us to make sure our customers are successfully implemented and so as part of that we have to explain what's involved in getting started so like I said uninterrupted time to have a business start using our software is the number one thing for us and like I said before we actually call and schedule support ahead of time proactively it's actually a little bit of a trick because it doesn't take a ton of our help to get started with our software but it because it's so important for our customers to set aside time it just gives them a really easy way to do that so that's what we do when we're talking to our customers but we have to keep working on this sales process because it's not natural to ask what are you doing now what works about that what not changing so we do three things to keep getting better at it the first one is role playing so it feels super cheesy to be acting you know and pretend you're the customer but it's so much better to practice on your friends your family your coworkers rather than practicing on the people who might give you money the other thing we do is we listen in on each other's calls we also have a virtual phone system called virtual PBX that lets us record every call it's super painful to listen to yourself screw up when you're talking on the phone so it's really important to concentrate on the things you're doing well over time those good parts of your conversation are gonna keep getting better and there's going to be more and more of those good parts and then the final thing we do is we write down our entire process so we use our internal wiki we use Atlassian confluence and by having it all written down over time it's easier to anticipate your customers answers to your questions but the important thing is to let them to do the talking so we've made a lot of changes to our business over the years right we've been doing this 11 years and one of the key things is having this repeatable sales process because not just the business is better but actually life is better it used to take us over 30 man-hours over the course of months sometimes years to get a sale we actually had two full-time salespeople doing just that and it was a black hole of follow-up you'd leave endless voicemails emails and it was painful and demoralizing and if you're afraid of doing sales calls it's probably that part of it that is the most terrifying I know that that's what scared me so now on average it takes about three hours over the course of days sometimes weeks to get that same result the other benefit is I don't have to be the guy so anyone who answers the phone at our company knows exactly what to say because our process is really simple all you have to do is remember what are you doing now what works about that what not changing so feel free to ask me about this anytime I'm happy to talk about our business I even showed the x-axis on my revenue chart so and next year I hope I can give a presentation about how my business partner tricked me into doing a micro comm talk Thanks thank you
