[Music] right off the bat I want to thank everybody I know I'm the only person standing between drinks so I will try to do my best speed things through I also want to thank everybody for coming today absolutely humbled to be invited to speak and I also want to thank my fiance who always asked me why I never mentioned her Renee she we're actually expecting so she's five month pregnant thank you exact I was gonna say I'm not a virgin but I could I was like which picture she's gonna allow me to put on my slides so I'm Canadian anybody meets me within the first few seconds I usually drop that in I don't have an accent like a lot of the Canadians but I will say a quite a bit in a boot I've been doing startups pretty much since I was 19 I'm onto my fifth company clarity prior to that I did a web hosting company so much like heating I learned a lesson there don't start a web hosting company I then did a vacation travel site lesson I learned there was think bigger it was actually called Atlantic vacations calm which is the region I was from and then in 2004 I was fortunate enough to start a company called sphere technologies that focused on enterprise social applications and it was kind of like a consulting company with the product and over four years we grew it by 150 plus percent to 30 ploys and then we got quired in 2008 that was an awesome year it happened right before the crash some people asked me if I was like I saw the market and I knew it was gonna happen I had no clue whatsoever it was definitely luck but that year I decided to move to San Francisco and see if any of my crazy ideas would actually hold water with some of the smartest technology entrepreneurs in the world and in 2009 I started company called flowtown which I'll talk more about had a great ride with that we actually got acquired last October and then two months into that I realized that I wasn't living my passion and we'd been earlier they were talking about Steve Jobs and it was really around that time where I I when Steve Jobs passed away I asked myself like am i working on my most meaningful impactful stuff and we haven't announced but I'm working on new stars called clarity and the high level is clarity is the easiest way to give and get advice I believe the best advice you can get are from people that have been successful in the thing you're about to do for the first time not turning to your parents your co-workers or your friends because at the end of the day they don't want you to screw up so they're always gonna let you play safe so that's clarity so the clicker is not working so the flowtown evolution flowtown actually has quite a long history that's relevant to the growth hacking and kind of how we made it work in the first few days I had a co-founder called Ethan Ethan was 23 when we started the company he's not only like 26 so he's not that old but we both had a passion for helping small businesses solve marketing problems is back when social media was starting to take off and I noticed a lot of people selling social media expert advice and I thought to myself why isn't there a better solution that people can just self-serve and use much like people do with email then I have to hire an email consultant I can just use a product like MailChimp and be on their way and trying to do what we thought was Lean Startup and we actually launched as a consulting company in disguise and we said from day one we're gonna launch this company called flowtown we're gonna focus on small business marketing and after that we're gonna try to get 15 customers to pay us between five hundred and thousand dollars a month to solve their small business marketing needs and from that experience extract these product ideas and we did that in over three month period we went out to the market works with a lot of customers and we iterated and prototyped up to seven different applications and then there was the day we had to decide like what product do we lead with and that was that was actually a really hard decision I think where a lot of people in this room you have a lot of ideas and you're like which one should I work on so after thinking through some stuff we decide to build a product called landing pages and if you've ever used Unbounce comm which full disclosure I'm actually an investor in today it was very much like Unbounce but way before Unbounce and we worked on it for two months so we actually fired all over customers so blog like thanks for coming out we transition them all off to other people that could help them in those specific areas that we we worked with and then we worked on the product and then we launched and we were pumped we thought for sure like finally we got this great idea we're gonna put out the market and we worked our ass off to get registered users and we get up to 400 subscribers to this product and not one paying customer it was like just like not there was nothing we could do to get anybody to upgrade I remember there's one day Ethan calls me on my cell phone he's like dude you wouldn't believe what happened I'm like what tell me the news it's like somebody upgraded I was like what's his name is guy VK from India I was like yes I was like what's he selling he's like Oh some spammy I Chi berry thing I was a crap right I was hoping it was a small business owner it wasn't anyways so we self-funded that company from the service revenue plus I put in close to about a hundred thousand dollars at time we hired a developer we built the product and you know it was like we had like two weeks of runway before I had to write another check and I went to Ethan's house and when new his kitchen was like what are we gonna do like clearly this products not working we got to figure it out and he's like I don't know and we had built these other prototypes and I'm like well the one lesson I've learned is try to solve the problem that you have and I just asked him like what tools you use every day he goes well actually use Hedwig and Hedwig was a product that lets you put an email address in and get all the social and demographic data for that email and I was using it every day because I was doing business and Ethan was using every day because he was doing customer support and here we are both using this product and I had no clue that he was using it and I was like well let's let's change this around how can we figure out how do what we should build without actually going to market and that's when we actually like sat down and really studied Eric Ries and Steve Blank stuff on Lean Startup and custom development and we built essentially product screenshots high fidelity product screenshots and we went out to our friends in the market and said hey here's what we're thinking of building and essentially the idea was really simple give us an email or connect it to your signup form and we'll actually let you set up notifications for when somebody important signed up because we can go from an email to Twitter and then Twitter to Klout and tell you if somebody with the Klout score of above 40 s signed up so you could actually reach out to them personally and we pre-sold that to 20 people then we built a landing page that took that concept a bit further still then built a whole lot of the product and that landing page let people upload a bunch of emails and then we tell them how much it was and then had an option to pay we just charged five cents an email and we send it to a hundred people when we saw how many people signed up we actually got 25% conversion to people that would pay and then we opened up that further and eventually we decided to invite every of our other users to that product and things took off right but there was a seven month period where we were working we had no clue what we were doing we thought we had the prior product we put it out there it didn't work and we just kind of retooled and this is vanity metrics but we ended up doing in two months we got to breaking or doing 20,000 a month in revenue in two months and this is what the growth curve looked like right and there's a quote that I like to use which is often wrong never in doubt right this is great for men telling their wives because like the end of the day I knew that there was something there and maybe I was gonna be wrong but I was never doubtful that we would figure it out and within a few weeks after we got to our 20,000 a month in revenue we actually raised $750,000 we grew the business by 33 percent month-over-month for 11 months getting almost to a hundred thousand a month in revenue wrench you know our VCS were happy and all that stuff and then we got shut down Facebook changed their Terms of Service and some of the ways we're aggregating the data and they called us us up and said you have two months to stop doing what you're doing right there was some other bad actors in the market working on stuff and essentially we got wrapped up in it so we went back to the whiteboard the reason I tell you guys this is because I went through that process several times in one company so we went to the whiteboard came up with three ideas that were passion about worked on them one product was called timely another product was called spider-man which was for social aggregation and content another one was this idea of gift marketing initially was called ambassador right how can we allow companies to give products to people we then took that idea and realized that was the one we were gonna follow and grew that back up our revenues and eventually get acquired again like twelve months later right and the one thing that I've always joked was for me the product is the ante to get into the startup give me a product and I can help it grow but before that you need to figure out what you you want to build so what I'm going to talk about is kind of two things that I do to try to understand what am i building is my customer actually care so first one is called activitystreams and you can get this for free if you use a product like KISSmetrics that heat and built or there's other tools out there but the concept is simple is you want to and this is from day one I build this for clarity from day one I said I want to watch what people do in our product I want to log all that data so that I can actually do more qualitative assessments of what they're doing and how they're doing it and it's pretty much like a new speed for your product and here's actually a screenshot so I can show this now that we got acquired and then demand force acquired us just got acquired buy into it for four hundred fifty million so I'm pretty sure all the legal trail is well figured out so these are yeah I don't have emails who I do anyways these are the users for a product we built called timely and what I would do as kind of like the product person is I would sit in front of the stream and try to look at people sign up set up so what timely does is it allows you to queue a bunch of tweets and then figure out throughout the day when it should tweet for you based on your history and the engagement and so I was looking at this and we were tracking our metrics I'll talk about that but I realized that people would sign up but they would not schedule a tweet and I was like well I don't get it here's a qualified user goes to the site signs up so they obviously know what we do and think that they want to solve that problem connects their Twitter account but then they never schedule a tweet so because we log their emails the best part of an activity stream is I just click the email and I would email them say hey John I knows you signed out but you didn't we yeah man I love timely have you ever had people say that like they use your product once they love you but they don't use it or even the better one is the ones that have never used it but still love you I mean we live in a wild world but I was I ask those like why didn't you tweet and he's and and this is users will say this and they're deceiving I got busy but I'm gonna check it out tomorrow that means there's something you didn't solve enough pain or at make the flow fluid enough and as I sent out these emails over a dozen emails I realized that they they wanted the solution but they actually didn't have anything to say at the time they didn't have anything to share so I brainstorm for bit I thought what's the like the most universal thing that you can give somebody to tweet and I thought it was quotes so with one feature change we had like a 7% activation to tweet we got up to 60 or 70 60 to 70 percent by adding one feature which was as soon as they logged in we would suggest these 10 quotes that they could add to their queue and that got them tweeting and to me having the ability to understand what users are doing and how they're being successful through your product is the first thing you should be looking at to understand if you're actually adding value or creating a must-have product the other concept which I thought was like black magic you know cohorts and metrics and you hear about it but you know I dare you to ask any one of these guys how cohorts work I'll do my best attempt but it's like one of these things where there's different ways to look at it but from day one I think it's very important to instrument your product to measure all the information even if you have no way to report on it again use the kiss metrics if you want to get it out of the box but at the end of the day you want to instrument how people are coming to your site and what they're doing the product and then you want to segment that information based on groups of users and when they do things and understand are you actually getting better so the best cohort to look at is age cohort so let's say you take the action signed up and then you want to figure out our people coming back so you look at the amount of people that signed up in the first week and then the second week did those people come back and then the week after did they come back again in the third week in the fourth week in the fifth week and hopefully what will happen is you'll start with bunch of people come back the week before or the the first week and then it slowly drops down your business you know your business really sucks if you go to zero right because a lot of people don't want to run this report because it's kind of scary but this is kind of what it looks like and the metric that I like to ask entrepreneurs to try to report on is retention if you're not charging for your product the next best filter or proxy is looking at how many people got value from that first interaction and came back and if you can get to a 20% weekly retention or 15% weekly retention where it stops in at flatlines you know you're doing something good we had a we were working on an idea for retention because at the beginning this is this is what happened to us right it flatlined and the one feature that we added after talking to our users looking at the Activity Stream which shared accounts the ability for somebody to share their cue with other users meant that they could get the value of it in bringing in their friends or their co-workers actually fill up the queue and we would have never even thought of doing that if we didn't realize that our users were actually not coming back because it's easy when you first get out there you get a bunch of signups but you don't know if you're building something that's long-term value so OPN growth hacking so the first two things I want to talk about was more about like how do you identify if you're building anything people want the second part that this is growth hacking and OPN is a concept that I took from real estate so if anybody's done real estate they call it OPM other people's money you get to buy houses by you know getting money from your bank or investors and theirs and you can do the same thing with your startup so the other people's network is the concept we talked about or heatin touched on it where you want to look at other social networks that your customers might be hanging out and pull them over and and there's some real famous ones that most people don't know about so like PayPal did this with eBay right and YouTube did this with myspace write myspace had all these you know social network type product and YouTube said we need to figure out a way to embed those videos into my space so that people would explore and see those videos and then come to YouTube there's been a lot of companies to do it on top of Craigslist one way we did it was actually on top of email clients so flowtown had a product that allowed people to upload emails and we give them the social data so I was sitting there on the whiteboard asking myself what are the different ways who are the different people have emails and the no-brainer one was email marketing companies so the first email I sent out was to the CEO of MailChimp and I said hey we've got this thing with social data and demographic information for email providers so they can easily segment their list and the cool thing because we we were still bootstrapping then is he said well it's something we've been thinking about doing but we're not going to do now and I said well we can provide it now but because we're early or bootstrap and it'd be great if you know somehow you could pay us for the integration so not only did we get distribution on MailChimp I actually made them pay for it and agree and this is the the winner to do a co marketing agreement you've got to ask for it which essentially it's like you know because if you don't get that I call the Barney relationships where you both like each other you agree to hug but nothing really happens all right you want to make sure that you get them to agree that when you do that integration that they're gonna promote it to their list the MailChimp integration then went to an Constant Contact integration to an eye contact to a campaign monitor so we did for the email platforms same concept where the other emails CRM applications all right batch book Salesforce high-rise all right where else form submission okay let's do whoo-hoo form stack and then we eventually did Unbounce right so I mean the idea of thinking about where your customers are and what tools or what kind of platforms they're using and you can add value is a huge one so I call that concept OPN and I do it for a lot of companies I've invested in to help them figure out their growth the other one is it's more of a story but what you want to do and I was talking to some entrepreneurs earlier is you want to figure out who currently sells to your customer if you're selling to enterprise clients you want to figure out what are other products what are other things we're places these people go what are other conferences they attend so that you can try to figure out how to get yourself into that customer so when I started spirit the enterprise portal software company within six weeks we almost went bankrupt because I didn't know a thing called cashflow right and I'm sure most first-time entrepreneurs especially the technical ones in the room they ran into this I hired four guys day one I had clients I thought it was awesome and next thing you know I couldn't make payroll and I had this guy Andrew that had a two-year-old daughter and and much like Pell D said when the guy was like you know what if it doesn't work I just knew in my bones that could not not make it work and what I did is I started thinking about you know where what did these people do before they spend millions of dollars on this enterprise software that we're specialists in what do they do that we can figure out and my friend Bob told me a story about the number one stationary sales guy and the story goes that this young sales guy saw this older sales guy just dominating right he was like making all his numbers and he felt like he never worked and one day said look I'd love to you know buy you lunch to figure out how are you always making your numbers and the guys like I'll tell you what meet me tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. and we'll go for a drive so he meets with this guy the next day 9:00 a.m. goes for drive and he goes to the warehouse of their competitor and he sits in the parking lot and he says today is Thursday and every Thursday our competitors ship the product and they followed all the companies that got the product shipped and then the next day he actually caught what he did he noticed it was that day the next month the day before they shipped he actually called them up and introduced himself to get their orders right so these are what you got to figure out is who sells to these companies that you want to get his customers right when I went to demand force the thing that I learned from day one and the reason why they were growing like crazy was that for every vertical they were in they partnered with the number one or number two supplier for that vertical when it was dental they went to dent Rick's when it was automotive they went Napa and they made an agreement with those companies to take the sales guy with their sales guy and walked them into the client they could close a deal in 30 minutes it was worth $6,000 and for every one of your businesses you have that you just got to get creative about where to find it sorry this is actually a picture of my brother and when I took this picture the first thing my brother said was don't you ever show it to anybody luckily I got permission about to use it but the reason why I want to talk about this is here's a guy that today is a homebuilder non-technical I mean my brother used the wind I don't want to knock on windows but he's on Windows before I got into Mac but you know it didn't have a smartphone super non techie and care stories an interesting one where he started his career as a mechanic and Pierre went for college and mechanic got his papers I still find it crazy that in the technical world we can actually go work on really complicated systems without any certification but as a mechanic you had to spend four years get papers being apprentice it was ridiculous anyways Pierre like many entrepreneurs went you know he was an entrepreneur he went to work in a mechanic and intern there and but he wanted to start his own shop and the thing from day one he said to the owner Ralph he said look someday you're gonna retire and I want to buy this shop from you and Ralph's like oh that's such an awesome plan we should definitely do that you know Pierre if you work really hard I'll give you equity in the company so Pierre did that he worked his ass off right one awards actually is like a technician and all this stuff first year he sits out he like goes the Ralph says hey Ralph loved to sit down figure out some paperwork or else's yeah let's talk about it next year this went on for two or three years and then finally on the fourth year Pierre goes to talk to Ralph and Ralph says to him you know up here I know we agreed that someday when I retired you would take over but I just don't see myself doing this I don't think I'm gonna retire because he was doing so well cuz Pierre was given his heart and soul and Pierre quit and he calls me up and I was about halfway through my company's spirit and we were doing really well and he goes meet me at the house I was like okay what's going on is like just meet me at the house so anyways go to his house because I quit dude how did you how did you quit you just went to college he goes you know what I don't even like being a mechanic and I was like wow it's kind of good that you realized this now before you actually got really deep into it because I want to do something else and I was I'd asked them well what are you passionate about and he thought about it for a bit and he goes well I just finished helping my friend build a house and that was really an awesome experience I thought it was really cool that every weekend for the last eight weeks we'd go work on his house you know drink some beers and at the end of it this guy was gonna live in this place it'd be really cool to build houses and I was like you should do that he goes I don't know anything about building houses I'm gonna that's cool man I didn't know [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about starting companies either it's you'll figure it out and so he did that I actually took all the money I had in my bank account at that time to finance my brother cuz I don't know about you guys I'm passionate but helping people to be successful when it comes to my family I'll do anything for them so I gave him all the money I had in his my bank account and I went to the bank and cosign all his loans that's not a good idea but anyways it was like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that was really risky but what's what ended up happening is peer like many entrepreneur's want to compete on price and so he decided he was gonna build their like the best house for the cheapest money and he went he did that and he built two houses and I just asked him like once my house things guys like good and I'm like every sold a house is like he's like no I'm like okay and then I remember he called me up and this is the day I took this picture where I was walking through I went to his house and I win the kitchen I looked around and there was no kitchen table I thought this is weird I was like screaming hey Pierre you got it where's your kitchen table man it's like I don't talk about him in my office okay alright so I walked down the into the living room and I look around there's no TV there's no couches as I hate Pierre I think somebody stole all your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] he's like I don't want to talk about just come to my my office so I go down the hallway and start walking down this way and I look in his room nothing in his room except air mattress in a sleeping bag and I could see Pierre and that's when I took out my camera because looking at he's like smiling but he's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stressed though I was like dude where's all your stuff he goes man I didn't want to tell you but I we haven't sold one house and we're about to like go under and somebody a real estate agent told him that if he staged the houses he might actually sell them faster he took everything from his own house and moved it into one of the units that was honestly the day I realized that no matter what I went into business with the guy that was gonna make it work so I sat down with him and I was like Pierre I don't know anything about building houses by know about building businesses let's talk about it and we went through the same process I just talked to you guys about Lean Startup I mean the problem appear is that he built the house that in the industry it's called having no curb appeal and I don't care who you are and what price you're selling that house for if it looks like this this is the house no dude is gonna buy a house where his wife is not happy women make the decision so anyways I roll up my sleeves and we start talking about it and the first idea had to us and look you don't know what you're building right clearly we figured out how to get rid of these houses but what you want to do is you want to talk to the market right kind of like the Activity Stream so what he did is he created these cocktail happy hours you invite a bunch of his female friends like his girlfriends and other people first time home buyers feed them martinis and actually drive around in a van and look at other people's open houses to figure out what they liked and then they would all go back to his kitchen he hired a girl to facilitate this so he wasn't involved they would take all the pictures they took throughout the day and assemble the perfect house that they would just be totally excited to buy and he took all that information gave it to an architect he really started to understand who his customer was first-time homebuyers in women I mean pure understood it so much this was the slogan or this is the house he ended up building but this is a slogan that was on his booth at the trade show I mean people that like guys would walk by the booth and see it and like the woman would hit her husband and you know and he was like oh I don't like that guy right like people in the industry I come from a town of a hundred thousand people other home builders here I mean just to give you an idea things turn around so good on average most home builders in America build four homes per year right and that's everything from the guy that builds one for millions of dollars to the big national chains in his first year after he figured it out he built 16 right peer got it so good when we started talking about different ways engaged with the customers he ended up doing things instead of giving away bottles of wine he wanted he thought well my customers just bought their first home is the largest transaction financially it'll probably make for their whole life let's keep them going and he said I'm gonna I bought two tickets for the wife and though and the man to jump out of a plane on the day of the closing right and you know as cool as most of them never redeemed it but holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did they tell everybody honey you gonna do it I don't know I watch you do it well you can go with Bob he's like so word of mouth was crazy he they did a thing for charity run for the Cure right where they put pink mustaches on the front of all their trucks and drove around the city and raised thousands of dollars for run for the Cure he even thought what's the other pain points that people have when they build a first time house is like where the hell is my contractor if you've ever built the house yourself and I just went through the process and my brother built the house obviously you want to know where they're at and what they're doing he put GPS tracking in all of the trucks with a video camera that you could click through if you go to his singing click through it's called where's my contractor he really really figured it out and he's now building over a hundred homes a year this is only five years later Wright won awards but the thing he did I mean just understanding this customer he realized one day when he was watching they were working on a new subdivision that the customer from day one when all there was as a foundation and a hole in the ground would drive up every night to watch that hole get built more like seriously I don't know I've got stuff to do but every night he'd watched these people drive up so he said why don't I just take pictures of the process water marked them with our logo and email them on a weekly basis and then they could share it I mean you wouldn't believe the amount of social sharing that's going on with pictures that he takes watermarks and gives to his customers and how excited they're to get those emails every week so the lesson is just like figure out what your customers who they are what they're doing and then try to figure out what's important to them and make that part of your core ethos or ethos of your company you know the last thing I want to talk about I could have went really deep on all the technical stuff about growth but when I look at my history and success I've had as an entrepreneur as an investor doing a bootstrap company that grew to 30 people to doing now to venture back companies I realized that there's really this truth about success and it's and there's a story and maybe you've heard it before I'm not gonna share anything new but there's this young man that wants to be wealthy and he goes to the local guru and he says I wanna I want to learn from you I want you to teach me how you've been successful and the Guru is like you want to learn from me he's like yeah I want teach me your ways I want to be wealthy he goes if you want to learn how to be successful meet me tomorrow morning at 4 a.m. at the beach and the kids like what are you talking about I want to learn how to be a lifeguard I want to learn how to be successful he's like if you want to be successful meet me tomorrow morning 4:00 a.m. on the beach so the next day the kid shows up in a suit right getting ready to learn from this guru business guy and the Guru is like all right grabs a guy by the hand it starts walking into the water and then that point he's thinking I probably should have wear shorts right and he gets him up to his waist and he's like what's this old man guru dude doing like this is crazy why are we walking in the water and he takes him from behind the back and kind of pushes him further and he gets up to his neck he's like this is the most craziest thing in the world what is he doing like I want to learn how to make money I don't wanna learn how to swim like this is ridiculous and then the grooc takes the guy's head and puts it under water and holds it there and the guy starts flailing and freaking out trying to figure out like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on and the gurus holding his head down and rape before he passes out the Guru pulls his head up above water and he asks him a question he goes when I had your head underwater what was the one thing you wanted more than anything does anybody know what that was just shout it out to breathe and he says to the kid when you want to succeed as much as you want to breathe you will have success I don't know if anybody in this room has asthma but if you've ever had an asthma attack and you're wheezing you're really trying to get a breath of air you don't care about parties you don't care about lost you don't care about your what your friends are up to you want to friggin get a breath and a lot of entrepreneurs I meet want to be successful but they would rather do anything else would be says I know guys that would rather sleep than to succeed anybody's had success Kelly talked about it there will be nights where you only get five hours four hours three hours of sleep there will be nights that you don't even go to bed and if you and I know there's people in this room where you would rather eat I know that I've gone moments where I forgot to eat because I'm heads down and I want to succeed because I know there's a moment in an opportunity that if I don't execute is going to be gone and there's a quote that I read this morning at paraphrases everything on that story is from Michelangelo and he said if you only knew the amount of work that went into this painting you wouldn't call it genius so I wanted to leave you guys with that message because it's probably more important than all the other stuff is just make sure that you really want this so I've got time for a few questions I want to thank everybody for coming out today all right questions people want to drink so great appreciate the question your name is okay thanks Matt oh awesome we're actually launching on Thursday so I'm really excited been working on it since January and just so you guys know my passion for clarity is connecting entrepreneurs because I came from a small town in Canada and I lived in San Francisco and I realized that my life changes an entrepreneur when I started getting advice from people have been successful before again not your parents not your friends so to me and I know this is a really really hard problem connecting those two people people that have the information that are super busy with the ones that need it in a way that respects both parties time so I'm excited to get the product out there but I know there's gonna be a lot of iterations but we launched on Thursday so yeah super excited thanks right so one one question that I've been meaning to ask you is that I always bring you up as an example of someone who does the lean stuff for real and like I heard you may be less COFF where you had everybody check-in anyone live immediately and you had automated rollback based on metrics that stuff seems very fancy and how much work is that really I mean it seems like you start off instrumented as you write the code you write the instrumentation code as well but how much more time does that take you know so that's a great question howdy there there's this thing that air calls Eric Ries right time right action and I think that's the most important part that doesn't get communicated and yes I think you know automated deployments and rollbacks based on metrics is something you could aspire to but you should not do that day one I mean day one we do the Activity Stream we do the cohort metrics we do customer interviews we surveys and we do do continuous integration but maybe we don't deploy so right now we don't do the automated deployment for clarity but we do have a build server that builds runs all the unit tests and then if something fails the team is notified so it's kind of like you want to figure out the right action at the right time based on where you're at because the truth is is I've done this so many times that I just assume I'm gonna be wrong right and that's a crate like people like how can you say is launch burned it's like I believe in myself the process but I'm just gonna assume that maybe I'm wrong on the idea so that I'm humble and open to figuring out what is the right solution to that so so you know at that point when we were talking about flowtown we were like into the product and we needed that to move faster thanks for the question you have a follow-up something I read on the in flight magazine on the way here this this business guy who was doing customer development just by taking a competitor's marketing material and showing it to potential customers saying hey you know would you buy this if it had a little angle which was his angle so he spent zero on you know he just took their website and said okay they forget the name is gonna be my name plus we're gonna do this I thought it was brilliant it's like other people's marketing yeah there's actually two techniques that I use one is from from competitors is open forums user voice get satisfaction any open forum that your competitors have go read the issues that the customers have because that's where you're gonna find your opportunities to get a wedge in the market and then really that's what you need you want to focus on a wedge and get that so I use my competitors information for that and then the other thing we did is for timely because we knew it was scheduling we asked ourselves what are the other Twitter tools in the market that do scheduling and let's approach customers that use those products using targeted Facebook ads and actually survey them to see if automating when it goes out is something they would want to bolt on to the scheduling again I mean I think those are great ideas because it kind of it's called like hyper customer development it's like the fastest way to fast-track it but yeah good thanks for that question Pelle yeah so if you're working with an entrepreneur that you realize okay they need to do cohort analysis how do you it kind of right now for my sake can you explain to them what it is and why they need it and where what other resources would you recommend for someone to learn it you know to really get good at understanding that realm of stuff yeah so I still can't figure out a better way to explain how to how to think about it but it's really just the concept of how do you know you're getting better right I think a lot of people they have like intuition right it's kind of like the art of the science they're really good artists that's why before people wouldn't do in lean startup concepts for years that's why there's been successful but they didn't know how or why they were doing it to me the cohort stuff is you know really just groups of users and then actions they've done over time and segmenting them out that way so that you know like people that signed up the first week they're doing the same action but how are they different than people second because you're improving your software you're improving your marketing pages you're improving the product so are those improvements actually having an effect or are they actually making it worse I see in a company change their homepage and it actually screwed up their signups but because they weren't like paying attention they never looked at it so other tools company called to tango that's doing it I mean honestly KISSmetrics is the best one to do it out of the box and if you want to do yourself I can send you some code that I've written that makes it work but at the end of the first thing to do is log everything all the data because if you don't have the day you can't actually go regression you want and then you have to like wait for the data thanks for the question anyways I'm gonna let everybody get out tonight thanks again for coming today you
