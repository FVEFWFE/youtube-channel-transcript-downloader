================================================================================

[Music] our next uh keynote is from leo barientos he is the co-founder and ceo of lexgo it's at lexgo.cl which is legal services for modern companies that's at least the translation i get um when i look at their homepage it's cervicios legales para empresas modernas that's as bad as my spanish is um but yeah leo welcome to the show thanks for joining us thank you rob it's a pleasure yeah and so just so folks know um lexco has two sides to the business model but you are i mean you're focused on uh being a legal sas app and you do have some one-off kind of consulting and contract work that you it's not consulting a contract it's just legal work that you outsource to some partners um but you're focused on south america and uh there you do have a large component of your business is the subscription that people pay just to have access to documents and signing and filling out completing uh documents in your app yep exactly um what we felt is that at least for the time being um if you want to power up your subscription model um you'll need for as a last resource for our users to get in contact with lawyers to uh just learn how to use the proper documentation for all sorts of different processes so it makes a lot of sense to for us to have that access while we push you should you be using ourselves because it's cheaper easier faster than just use regular uh lawyers excellent all right so let's dive in you're gonna be talking today about partnership marketing and really how you in the early days of lex go because now you have you have uh quite good traction i mean you and i have spoken um you know offline about your revenue and and how everything's going but partnership marketing was really how you got your kickstart so if producer xander if we can bring up leo's slides and we will start to roll through it yeah for sure so as rob said we are now based in automated legal service for setups what we try to do is enable founders to complete all of their legal processes that their company needs much faster and a fraction of the cost of lawyers also how we did that is just automating tons of legal workflows uh so founders can incorporate their company in different countries of the world hire their employees and do even some fundraising rounds through the platform without having to pay the premium that uh usually symbol while working with lawyers so uh but of course our product wasn't like that at the beginning um what we did i i would say that by the beginning we were some sort of avo dogs which is a yc company with another damn stripe battles and what i mean with a dumpster is that we automated all the legal paperwork but of course all the registration process wasn't in order just because we wanted to test who will be the real users of lexco at the beginning and um actually we did this while we were in the startup chile program back in 2017 and we quickly came out with three main pro at the beginning let's go was a b2c uh platform so we were focused on consumers that i i don't know they have one or two legal problems each year and that's that uh so we actually spend much more money than what we get from uh selling to them and the other typical problem that we have is that it was very difficult for us to qualify each of the new users that we have in the platform um because we were able to acquire from solo entrepreneurs to small businesses into tech companies and medium to big companies which was insane because the product was built for consumers but you couldn't tell that there was a huge need of product like let's go um and and i think very connected to this point is that small and medium businesses don't face the same legal challenges that our startup will face so legal spending on this on legal was very different between each of these companies which at the beginning of a new company was very difficult to say which of the futures or products shall we focus in order to move forward um and this is and the interesting part is that while we were in startup chile the funding from startup shield was very small um it's i remember by my time it was like 20 uh 25 000 um with a small investment from from the first annual so we were covering like our tech team and our on the founders salaries for the beginning and we didn't have too much money um in order to just sell lexico also we had to come up with a strategy to acquire new users almost on a free almost free so we take advantage of that we were going through the program we have uh startup children at that time had a batch of i don't know 60 to 80 companies and they were the first focus offer uses like okay please let me know uh if lexico is working for you what you're expecting from mexico and we knew that there was a huge problem for startup chile most incubators and accelerates especially the ones that work with international companies have a very hard time dealing with the soft landing of those companies in the country and how the structures you see that is around the world how to comply with local regulation etc so for for for us was very natural to go into that place and tell them like hey i can take care of this problem for you and i can act as a partner so i can offer you of some sort of discount discounted price on our services in order to deal with all of your portfolio companies that are coming to chile and from the from the from the user perspective there was uh i really like this bundled products in which that you arrive to chile or the us or whichever other and there's a company that can help you not only with incorporating what you need to go through this program but also just complying with all of the details of accounting taxes etc so um that's that's why we created very quickly this uh sort of straight up does for chile um all of our revenue in the six eight and months of of like scope came from this um very straightforward and i i will say like version two like which was the process of going from a b2c to a b2b platform was uh but it was i almost entirely focus on helping this companies and startups build their their companies around the world and scale their operation through through the region um so um and maybe for those who don't know how strike paddles work and maybe this is some difference with with lexco global which is our incorporation product is that we just wanted to offer an easy way to incorporate international startups in the in the markets they need to to be operating so the product not only includes company corporation but also goes with accounting and taxes and some banking solutions um and all of this products are and services are controlled through the lexico platform um so um this was very interesting because normally this was the the the first way to acquire a bunch of clients but also if you did a good job with them they will refer you to next into new uh clients and other founders who are working on the same kind of of issues and there's like a a virtual cycle in which the word of mouth help us acquire all of our new clients i'm gonna i'm gonna pop in here leo um yeah i love it you know there's a couple learnings already that may not even directly relate to partnerships but one is you started b2c because a lot of us that's our exposure as consumers and we're going to build a startup and why don't we serve consumers and a lot of us find that that's you know it's not a never do but it's uh my guidance is that 80 90 of the time if you really do want to do this and you want to build a sustainable ambitious you know sas product without raising a bunch of funding um usually b2b is is the way to go uh the other thing is you found out pretty early um or or i love i love the way you said that your early version of lexco was was avodax plus stripe atlas and you didn't mean that you combined those two you meant that that's what the platform essentially did like you you looked elsewhere into a separate market which was the you know really the u.s market and you said well that exists in the u.s so why can't it exist you know for south american countries um and then i love the uh really the the focus that we're about to dive into um on partnership so i'll let you continue from there yeah for sure um yeah like the the cool thing about the whole process that actually our own users tell us why we should be building and the necessity was very clear while in the v2c market you could tell that the market wasn't big or mature enough to to to want it to uh have access to these kind of solutions um so so uh as as i was speaking uh the the this first partnership with startup chile make a lot of sense for us and they were actually very relieved that they can count on let's go to solve the issue for the portfolio companies and go with this just trying to replicate the same model for every local incubator accelerator that uh that we could estimate they have the same problem and they did they were working with some of them with other law firms but we go back to the same problem the original problem right lawyers are too expensive i don't want to spend the premium that i need to in order to incorporate various standard companies implement very standard paperwork and so on um so after working with all of the local and incubators and accelerators you could tell that lexico was transitioning to some sort of company management in a box we were not only dealing with how you solved legal issues of your company but also how you comply with all of the obligations that comes with opening a company and then having a presence in all of the countries so and this is how we went to uh our second i was a series of partnerships that make a lot of sense to us it was that um because we didn't want to spend time on building a product that wasn't core to the core exp what was in court and was like uh our main base of what the lexico program should do is that we had to complement the program with auxiliary complementary services like accounting taxes banking etc just just in order to have this uh com company management box right um so um this was cool because not only we were achieving having a more robust product that solved all of the issues that founders were facing but also uh you could tell from the beginning that this is of course could be a great channel of acquisition for us just because if we are sending or or users to have access to accounting sas uh some taxes tax compliance banking solution etc they could do the same for us right whenever uh users from these companies were facing legal issues uh our great way to to solve them in order to provide their final services was sending them to luxury because we can take care of legal paperwork advice that is needed etc um right and if i can pop in here um you know i think a key here is that you found uh an aspirin pain you know aspirin versus vitamin right it's not hey maybe someday you need some legal protection it's like right now you need to incorporate or you need an ip agreement for your employees or you need uh you know hiring agreements just whatever you need and and you know that a lot of these companies pretty much all the companies need it and it's too expensive and it's too cumbersome and referring people out to law firms is a pain and so these partners these you're saying value-added partners they're um these accelerators constantly say we say with tiny seed we just constantly see this need for companies that have to do the same thing over and over and so when you engage these partners um they it was just an obvious like oh if you can take this pain away from our companies you take this pain away from us right and i think that's a key part of the story yeah i think that's completely right um and maybe just giving an example makes a lot of sense so for example we work with a chilean startup that is called book they do payroll services as a sas too and of course they don't provide any kind of legal advice about how you fire how you um i don't know how you deal with certain situations while working with your employees so the product came to some sort of deadlock when their users had that problem so they asked book like hey how can a fire what kind of justification i can do to do so in most of south american countries may give you some framework about this you need a justification in order to fire someone you can do it right away or you'll pay some fine and and higher amounts that you should so um of course they couldn't provide a service um because we were already working in that partnership we said like hey why we don't do it just with add a button that helps you very quickly to ask advice to the lexico team about this and they they will inform what's the best cause for firing an employee through your platform and you can calculate everything and do the whole process through book so that made us a lot of sense because they weren't able to provide their service properly because they were missing uh like a legal advice so um of course with every one of these sas companies that make a lot of sense working together what we did is of course we offer discounted prices to each other and and also these integrations that could helps you to offer a more reverse product just because the whole experience for the end user is much better when i can solve everything that i needs it even legal accounting or taxes in the same platform of of each of our um and that's what we call that's what we said that we are provo providing a solution to a need um just to making those platforms better and it's the same for the lexco case so and the cool thing is that because even today we have a very limited technical team is that we can focus on the things that are making us very powerful against competition but because we know there is a huge pain about uh dealing with all the things that are related to managing your company we needed to do those integration of partnerships in order to um just provide a product that solves uh the the the the pain in its integrity um and and i just wanted to talk a little bit about uh um on a specific partnership with our with it with clay which is uh the first punisher we close um the clay is up actually and startup also that they offer accounting as a software as a service solution um and of course as i was saying we offered a discounted price of of class service when you buy electrical glover or you hire any of our uh certain subscription plans in the in the platform and of course we integrate with them um it's i don't know from sales contracts that you sign and create in lexco but also um some payroll features etc and this and of course what we negotiate with them is that if we're gonna be an important channel of acquisition for you we would like to have certain percentage of the subscription plans we help you close um and i think even for the time being it's five percent of whatever they pay for them and at the same time not only we refer clients to clay they also deal with us because for example there was a lot of issues with some tax classification or how to count some i don't know from safe convertible nodes which is which everyone who has dealt with this know they are a little tricky to manage from accounting and tax perspective they didn't know how to deal with them up so of course whenever clay users need some sort of tax or legal advice about how to deal with other companies they refer us directly to lexco and we offered either a project or one of our subscription plans if they make sense to them um like we said before this make a lot of sense because we were both feeling this pain of not having access to in the case of lexco accounting services that complement or or solutions and on the case of them they were unable to offer their plans they have some deadlocks about tax and legal advice um so and this was pretty cool because just partnerships that make a lot of sense to our product i think last year we got like four thousand k on revenue just for this uh referrals um so it's it's incredible how they can add a lot of your mri or arr just having someone who helps you provide a good product and also uh it's a great acquisition channel for you and like a little revenue just for doing that effort and i think you can do that with tons of other companies that make sense to partner with i think nowadays we have expanded to a lot of other things like visas to different countries of course we partnered with amazon web um stripe helping uh i know south american companies that need to do a flip swap to the us and they need to deal with uh manage legal management of a us company which is the same case as us or foreign founders coming to south america so you i would love to just make lexco the platform which you know you can deal with everything that goes with company management as you scale your operational through the world and i don't know rob if you want to get into this or we should just speak about some specifics but i just wanted to show you about this couple of uh cases in which um punishes were very effective um of course if if i start speaking about every one of them that we know that we could say like yeah yeah foreign see if uh let's see if there are any questions from the audience i'm uh checking zan producer xander you can send me any questions that come up i do you have a question for you so what kind of i i guess you know obviously uh startup chile was the first partnership that you had and then you added additional accelerators after that right and have you been do you feel like the results from the initial partnership because obviously you had a unique relationship with startup chile and that they decided that you were they gave you some funding it was a small amount of funding but um that makes it easier to to have a partnership you still solve the desperate need they had and they wouldn't have used you as a as a customer or a referral if you didn't solve that do you feel like um that one feels like a no-brainer and an easy one to close were the other partnerships you were attempting to close were they harder because you know there was more perhaps a distance because other accelerators hadn't given you funding and so it was really a traditional business development uh relationship that you had to build yeah it's a great question um and and the whole experience with startup chilec give you a lot of insight about what where the challenges our accelerators were facing which are i think the same uh first of all they don't they don't really know how to deal with international companies so and those services are quite expensive especially because of that um so of course some of these accelerators had partnership with other law firms or lawyers but the pricing was way too high for for their portfolio companies so when you offer them automated solution that could scale very quickly um of course they would have access to legal advice if needed but they just have like an initial pricing that makes sense for companies that have that are just starting um so it wasn't difficult for us at all to close the spanish because first of all startup chile was like a a good branding chill labs the most famous accelerator by far um so just working with them and where part of the last batch for them was like i don't know a good sign for the rest of them and just because we understand the problem very uh clearly and we had a solution which which its price make a lot of sense for the for startup founders um because what they were telling us is that when they work with their law firms is that okay they'll give them a proposal which was i don't know six times more expensive than using any of the electrical products and okay so founders decided not to solve that issue so they they asked the accelerator they still had a problem with the profile company they know they have them they know expensive and the founders just decided not to deal with that this happens a lot at least in south america um and this is why you have huge legal expenses when you try to flip swap companies into the us just because you need to deal with cap tables that are a mess documentation that is not in order etc um so i don't know like the feat was just way too perfect um and now the problem was yet how we reach all the uh accelerates incubators not only chill about the rest of america that are facing similar challenges right all right we do have some questions coming in justin kistner asked how do you find potential partners what are the key parameters you think about when forming a partnership agreement i actually want to weigh in on that real quick just to give people a mental framework that i've used um there are referral partnerships which is what you've talked about where you provide so much value that they can't get anywhere else or that they get it anywhere else it's really expensive that it's just a no-brainer for them to refer people to you and those are unique there aren't a lot of them but if you can if you can do what you've done and feel such a desperate need in the market that's that's a great way to go the second time second type i think of is an integration partner where you have to write some code and you know the traditional thought processes you integrate with zapier or you integrate with we you know we integrated with pipedrive and uh and what basecamp and you know and then you get on there or stripe and you get on their little uh you try to get them to promote you try to get on their app list that's the second kind uh the third kind there can be the third kind is kind of a subset of the first one that you do where they take an affiliate commission you know event you eventually pay you essentially pay them a 10 20 30 kickback for referring you that's pretty common as well and the last one that i've done is called a joint venture partnership where you say hey we're complementary tools or complementary applications and we're each gonna email our customer list email our marketing list and we're not gonna do affiliate revenue we're just gonna i'm just gonna say hey we use your tool and we like it and you say the same thing and hopefully you're being honest when you say that but then you know you just get to keep the spoils so those are kind of the three slash four uh partnership things that i've seen um so just so people have a mental model it doesn't have to necessarily be you know the type you've talked about but the back to the question is how do you find potential partners and i'd love to hear your thoughts first and then you know i can weigh in if there's if there's other thoughts yeah i think we did all of the formulas you just talked about so we tried them all um how you find these partners um actually because we knew from from from the beginning that startup chill had this problem we went straight to all the local and accelerators and incubators to do the same then of course you start analyzing okay if this kind of organization have this problem what what kind of other legal problems other organizations have um and of course and this is interesting because we've dealt with other i don't know organization of companies that are not tech companies or our small medium businesses um some pro bono organizations that just needed to help companies at cheaper prices so they can i don't know buy us some subscription or um in volume um and but actually the one up that we we we get very quick is that other sas companies or tech companies are actually also dealing with acquisition right so normally uh we we hit two birds with one shot in the sense that uh we could help them get more clients and we also can help each of our products be better um i think that's like a very easy sell um and of course because we knew from from the first source that our clients were dealing with accounting taxes banking etc we knew that our product needs to include most of them in the case of lexical global we not only help with company corporation but also where whatever you need to comply with local regulations especially virtual offices and all this stuff and also banking like you know you if you want to create a startup you need the company to comply with everything and then have a bank account in order to receive payment for your users right um so um what we did is that we implement some of the solute the the different formulas that raw have just spoken about is that uh i don't know with the chilean bank they pay us for every referred client for over sas we offer discounted prices and we get a little uh referral percentage from other uh more i would say i don't know we start working with some companies and we've been working with us since the beginning so nowadays we have an agreement that is a little more reverse in the sense that normally we do cross marketing between each other uh we have some events run together we publish content from them in our own blog just to give oral for uses going not only to our services but also to them having access to the databases and so on so maybe i can speak a little about what we're doing nowadays is that um because we are now entering the in the face that we understand how chilean local companies are dealing with the problem how some organizations are facing different problems but just because they need to deal with all of this bunch of companies now we're dealing with the problem that how can you scale the company without losing the quality of service that exco has i don't want to have another legal provider in that sense so there's a huge problem i will say that the latin market and south american market especially from chile colombia and some other small countries not as attractive enough for a tech company so you need to move very quickly to other markets just to open it and have access to a bigger serviceable market so by what you don't want is to deal with five four law firms in each of the countries you need to expand so um we were going to okay who are the organizations that are facing the same problem until you have for example a government agency that is called prachila in which not only they fund companies that need to expand chilean services or or or goods but they also give them advice about how to structure the company uh go when they need to expand internationally so of course we approach them and say hey how are you dealing with this and yeah we have some friends and law firms that help us and they have the same problem startup chill so we say like hey i maybe i can create an automated product for each of the countries that you usually scale your operation to um so let me know who are those uh of i would love to have a chance to explain them to the current uh supported companies like hey you can have to access to these products um and we can help you with a very accessible price and you know you want we know you want to spend your money on your clients your product not on legal so this will make a lot of sense and this is the the last one of the last cases of use oh leo froze up a bit let's see if he comes back i can always pop in i was i think he'll pop in right as i start talking i bet um i actually have thoughts on this as well how do you find potential partners i can tell you what i've done so when i had an seo it's a sas seo keyword tool i went to google and i typed in seo tools uh seo rank trackers i knew they were just affiliated things that we didn't overlap and i sent a bunch of cold emails i sent like 10 cold emails and i got like eight replies to do joint ventures so seo spaces particularly suited for that but it's also something i've seen work the other thing we did is when i was trying to do it for drip which you know email service provider the question that we sat down with the team in front of whiteboard and i said okay we take in leads and we send emails what happens before and what happens after in the process like what happens before taking in leads one is you might have a landing page before that you might have a pay-per-click or social media software that are trying to drive traffic to those landing pages so those happen before what happens after you get into um you know a system like drip or a mailchimp they receive emails and then what do you want them to do usually you want them to raise their hand to become a prospect or a lead and then they would go into crm or you want them to buy something and so then it's like we'll integrate with gumroad paypal stripe you know these are the afters so that is also a cool diagram to have is what happens before your app in the in your ecosystem and what happens after not coincidentally those start as partnerships longer term if you really get big and expand you'll start to build out or acquire apps that do those same things so those are two quick thoughts um that i have on it leo we have i'm glad you're back we have another question for you no yeah no problem it's this is this is internet and this is this is doing it live so santiago had a question he says do you have exclusivity with the accounting bookkeeping app that you mentioned or do you have other uh you know other relationships yeah um in the beginning we didn't just because we weren't focused on that i think the first thing that you need to prove with your partners that you are useful to them um and you knew that you needed them to be on board uh just because uh your product is better and when you didn't have them with you you were just lacking that so when you start proving not only that you're helping them be a better product and also you are referring them a lot of clients we get into that discussion very quickly um so for example i know there's a lot of people that get into those details from the beginning for me is a waste of time like i just prefer to go very light on paperwork and agreements at the beginning and let's just check this in two to three months just to see how everything is working out and if the and if the feedback and and data is positive like i i will just say straightforward like hey what if we structure this we have some uh referral uh commissions to each of them and then we structure some sort of content plan in order to give them some activity to this partnership which works very well um and and the typical thing that you do if you close a lot of partnership but you don't activate them like they are completely useless so we focus just on a couple of them that make and then we put a lot of effort on making them useful for their portfolio company or members um i remember that startup chill had tons of different perks but yeah they didn't have any contact with them maybe some of the bigger like amazon facebook they have not only they have this partnership with them but they went they traveled to chile to give a workshop on some stuff so in in in some sort of sense they were active on the community and people were interested in working with them and sort of us so we did the same exactly the same for not only for this accelerators and incubators but also with our other companies that we work together we try to give work uh talks and workshops together create content that makes a lot of sense for our users uh for their accounting status uh how to deal with legal and for the legal users how to deal with accounting and of course we referred those products when we speak about those issues so um yeah i think that my advice will will be in those lines is that that i wouldn't fixate myself too much on these details but i will if if things are working working very well and you can quantify how many clients you're referring to them i will go into those details when you have the data all right and our last question for leo is how do you get a partnership going if someone has a partner covering that solution already for example our product is a website builder for fitness professionals but a lot of potential larger partners have a web agency partnership already in place so they're working with a consumer consulting firm who's already basically doing that for them but i know our product would be way better for their clients as well as the partner too do you try to muscle them out or just focus on building a relationship to start so it's an interesting question right there's almost like a gatekeeper that that and that agent those agencies are really good at building long-term relationships and good at enterprise sales or larger ticket consulting sales so agencies may have 10 20 30 clients and you know i think that the thought process here is do you go to each of those end clients and try to sell them on the solution that their agency is going to say yeah don't use that because that's essentially going to make them moot or do you go to the agency route and try to convince the agency try to build something you know that that they potentially need it's a very specific question so don't feel like you have to you know answer it in that context but i think in general what what are your thoughts on there before we wrap yeah um i think i have never have to deal with agencies that represent some other solutions but of course i've been getting to the same places which other law firms or legal alternative legal solutions already arrived and the only way that i was able to muscle out those competitors was of course because because there wasn't so many legal tech solutions just because how your works and your pricing was from like point one very effective and second is that we were able we were not only able but we wanted to spend time understanding very clearly what was the problem that we're facing um each of these organizations and then create a product that solves them um and of course you can do this this with everything with everyone but at the beginning the first couple of years made a lot of sense for us because we wanted to be the best ones dealing with tech companies in the country um and of course they were the main source not only of of clients but also information about what we need to build in order to solve these problems um so um and and there's a lot of little details about why they decided to go with let's go instead of i don't know the the big law firms or some other cool alternative legal providers that just because i don't know uh we spoke the same language we understand the problem startups were facing because we're also facing them ourselves we were very transparent on the prog where building is was to facilitate legal not to be just or these organizations be another channel we wanted to build a product that we know we could make more money offering legal advice on this but we wanted to create your prog just because we want everyone to have access to them um so we didn't choose this discourse or or pitch just because we knew it was effective we truly believe about that um and i know this is not like very concise advice about how to deal with this but i i i'm pretty sure that was the reason why we were so effective um every time we do any kind of activity or or building a specific pro for them like the portfolio founders and companies uh they could relate to us in a way they couldn't with law firms and i think this is when you get a little more about branding and how how your company brand talks to your users etc but i think that was one of the cool things we did from the beginning so for us wasn't a problem to close partnership because our founding team and the marketing we were able to spend a lot of time just helping this very specific group of users uh which is which sounds contour sounds weird because you're focusing on a very small market but you want them to love your solution and i think that's always very effective all right thank you so much sir for joining us today um and we are going to if well folks want to keep up with you online are you on twitter where can they uh you know keep up with what you're up to yeah um i'm in twitter um i think it's leo varientos p um you can also get me a link then i think it's a little easier um please don't write me leonardo liu is more than enough uh latin names could be difficult especially with pronunciation uh but you're surprised your spanish was pretty cool don't worry about that i think that that's like five or six years of spanish class in um in california schools so i think it served me well awesome thanks again for for joining me today leah i appreciate it i was a pleasure meeting you all thank you guys you
