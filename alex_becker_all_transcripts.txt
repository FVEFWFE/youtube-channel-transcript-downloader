================================================================================

Look, on this channel, I talk SAS and tech entrepreneurship. But if you're a business owner of any kind, if you do not get what I put in this video, you're going to fail just like all these influencer businesses. So, I know what you're thinking. Why am I mentioning influencer businesses? Because it's a perfect example of what I need to teach you today. Your business is destined to fail without it. Check out this post on X the other day. You can see all the way from Logan Paul, Casey Neistat. I'm sure you've seen all the make money online influencers who've launched their own software companies and try to get into the AI agent business. All these businesses launch tons of hype, tons of customers, huge marketing, and then they all flop and fail. Why? It's because the procs failed to achieve product market fit. They didn't check to make sure they had this before they launched their business. And so, even with the best hype in the entire world, they still all failed. And product market fit is more than just making customers like your product. It's making sure people understand, stay, and continue to pay for your product, which is an entire other beast that we're going to tackle in this video. And if you can get this first, you can essentially guarantee your SAS product or any type of business you're running is going to work, keep customers, and keep growing and making you more money. People ask me all the time, "How do I know if my product idea is good?" This is the cheat code for it that I'm about to teach you. And I would listen because this built me a software company worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and I've used to build many, many smaller companies. They're worth eight figures. It's just crispy. This is how you do it and this is how you make sure it's going to work every single time and you don't have these businesses go like all these influencer businesses. Let's discuss. Here's the first thing. Product market fit. Woo spilled a mystical letters behind this. Everybody talks about product market fit. It's talked about in SAS. If you were in tech at all, this is everybody's product market fit. Product market fit. But no one knows what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] product market fit is or has a definition for it. So, I'm going to give you a definition that actually works. And if you just achieve this one damn thing, you are going to have success. And in this video, I'm going to give you a checklist that you can go through to make sure you've achieved product market fit. Now, in a nutshell, what product market fit is is essentially where you've hit a point where your product has customers come in, people love the product, and you start seeing sales take off because people are buying your product, they're telling their friends about their product, they're using the product, they're buying more of your product, aka you have a product that works. But that's such a vague definition. And so what I actually think it is is when you actually have this and if you have this, you have a product that can scale and make you a lot of money if the market's big enough. It is when you have a collection of 20 to 50 customers that will actively freak the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out if you turn off your product. And why would they freak out? It's because the result you are getting them is so consequential and so useful to their life that the amount of money they give you is not even an issue. It's trivial for them. In fact, they demand you take your money. If you started rejecting their money and block their access to the product, they would come with pitchforks, light your house on fire, be extremely upset. If you've ever noticed, for example, when Fortnite goes down for 15 minutes, the people don't complain or want refunds or want their money back or or to stop using the product, they start gouging their eyes out and screaming and losing their mind. This is what product market fit looks like. And so, whenever you're building a product, the first thing you're going to want to look for is this. But I'm going to break down specific criteria for you that if you achieve this checklist right here, you're going to have success because to get to this point right here, you need to know the indicators and what to build around and what things to build through. It's not just something that happens all at once. You have to build it in order. Okay, so look again, like I say before, this is exactly what I used to build my software company, Hyros, which is closing in on $40 million AR. We're growing about 40 50% a year right now. So it works obviously to this point. If you have a software company making $100 million a year, please, you don't got to listen to this video, but at least works to this point. So, take it for what it is. Now, you're also going to see me doing the same exact process with our new AI product at Hyros. You're going to notice I'm not really marketing this product for the exact reason why these influencer businesses are blowing up. You're going to see me going through this exact same checklist. So, this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] works. So, pay attention. So, the first thing you need to look for is does it get a result for your target customer every single time? Okay. So let's talk about it in terms of my product air. So what we have right now is an AI agent. It goes out, you put on people's websites, it detects people coming to the website, and then it uses AI to reach out to them, bring them back to the website, close them, and get them on calls, increase sales. When it's put on a customer's website the right way, it increases their business by 3 to 5% each time. I'm not here to pitch you air. I'm just telling you what it does and how I look at my product and how you can look at it for your product. So the first thing is there's a lot of different types of businesses that could join up for this right now. For example, we could have like a an agency that's going to try and generate leads. Now the most important thing is we have to nail our target market first off. And so where we're trying to really get the best results are are for SAS and Shopify stores. Okay, this is our target customer with this initially. Works for everything, but these are the ones we really want to get results with every single time. So, the most important thing you need to do is you need to identify your target customer. It can't be everybody. We don't need to get results for everybody. Not everybody that logs in has every type of business type, whether they're running a zoo or a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Pokemon card store, needs to be able to sign up and get results. Just your target market, whatever it is, pick a target market, go after it. If they sign up and you hold their hand and do it for them, do they get a result 100% of the time? If the answer is no, your product isn't good enough. You don't need to be marketing it. You don't need to be taking the market. You don't need to be trying to sell it. This is it. The end. You need to go back and say, "Hey, have we nailed our target customer and their problems well enough to get them results or not. If it's not like if they're not coming in and getting a result every single time, the product doesn't work. Now, they don't have to come up and set up the product. They don't even have to use the product. If you use the product for them, aka you jerryrig it for success for them. You use your own product on their store, will they get results?" The answer is no. Do not move past this step. Keep doing this until this step is at 100%. You don't have to get them to sign up for the software or your product or whatever you're using again and they get the result. If you did it for them, would they 100% get a result? Because getting them to use the product and actively use it in their lives is a whole entire other problem. But this is the first one. Does it get a result 100% of the time? So at Air for example, before we even took this live or mentioned it, we made sure we got about 20 Shopify stores. We put them on. We made sure their revenue increased 3 to 5% when we put it on. We got SAS companies. We made sure their calls increase every single time when we set it up for them. We didn't market it. We didn't go and make some big drop. We made sure it worked every damn time before even considering putting this on our website. Now, let's look at these influencer businesses that are launching all the time. I'm going to give you just two really super duper simple examples. You see a lot of business gurus go and launch softwares. And if you've seen them launch them, the softwares are always gone within a year. Why does this happen? If they have such a huge following, and they have so many people that know about them, it's because their customers all come in, they don't get results, and then they stop paying for the software. If you do not have customers that pay three times, four times, six times, and pay for the next two, three, four years and keep coming back to your business, you don't have a business. You just don't have a business. So, there's no point in launching a product if people are not getting the result that they're looking for. You see all these fitness people launch these results in these courses or supplements and then people don't get results and people just don't give you money for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they don't need. If they don't need something they are cutting it off like that. You must make sure they get a result 100% of the time. Now the next thing you need to do once they are getting result 100% of the time you actually are cooking with fire because your main challenge right now is not having a product to get results. It's getting people to actually use the product and get results. So you must move to the next step which is the big question. Is this target market big enough? Okay. So, for example, if we got 1% of the entire SAS market and 1% of the entire Shopify market with Hyros Air, well, we we're making hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Perfectly fine. Market's big enough. If we are going after every single organic dentist in the Plano area, that's our that's our target demographic or the little suburb. No, we're not going to be able to scale this to $100 million a year. You need to be able to look at what's your goal income. So, if you want to make a million dollar per year, you can actually just go in a small market and make a small business that makes a million per year and just dominate the hell out of it. Totally fine. If you want to go and make $10 million, you're going to need more target customers. You need to look at the type of customers you're working with as well. For example, Harvey is a AI agent platform for lawyers and it only has about 500 customers. I think last I checked they're doing about $150 million a year in revenue or something crazy like that. I I forgot it was, but they had a very small amount of customers in return for how much money they're making. So again, because their target market is lawyers, there doesn't need to be zillions of customers. There just needs to be like a thousand of them, 500 of them, and they're doing very, very well. I looked at another company called Turig, and most of their money all comes from eight customers. If you look at Nvidia, I think almost all of their revenue comes from like two or three other companies. So, you got to think, you got to look at these numbers and you got to actually look at the customer size and what's going on there. So after you've identified that the target is market is big enough, you now need to go and determine if the problem and solution is big enough. Okay, so what do I mean by this? Remember when I said those people who get angry if you turn it off? So look, if you come and create some type of glue that makes my refrigerator stop squeaking and the glue costs $1,000, I'm probably just not going to pay you for that because that's not that big of a problem in my life. However, if I have a wart growing on my face and without your ointment, this wart just gets bigger and bigger, I will pay you $10,000 a day for that product. So, what you need to understand about this is that you need to solve a problem that's big enough in relation to the money that you're trying to charge that the person will lose their absolute mind if you turn it off. For example, if we connect someone to air at Hyros and they're making an extra 3 to 5% a month. Say it's a Shopify store making 100,000 a month and then we make them an extra $5,000 $7,000 per month and then we turn off air. They get really peevey very quickly. Like we can flip it on and off and make their emotions go up. We don't do this. Okay, this not this is not something we've attempted at Hyros. But I'm making the point right here. If you look at, for example, Logan Paul's Prime energy drink, which is not doing so well right now from what I heard. I'm actually I like Logan Paul. There's nothing against Logan Paul or anything they're doing. It's just the prime example of an influencer business not going well after taking off. Did the people get morbidly upset when they took away Prime or they stopped buying Prime? No. They didn't have a hard problem that they solved. That's it. It didn't. People didn't get super upset when you when they stopped buying Prime. Problem right there. If you look at a lot of these influencer businesses where they launch software, they make an attempt at software. What happens when people forget to pay their bill at the software companies that these influencers launch? Nothing. like the people don't notice. They're like, "Oh, this software I was paying for, uh, it's not there anymore." If you have that situation, you don't have a you don't have a company. Yeah, you can solve the problem, but if the problem's not that big, the person is not going to stick around. You want something, the second that credit card bill defaults or something, the person flips out because it's turn off. If if I don't pay my cell phone bill, it turns off. I notice like immediately within minutes. Okay. If I don't pay our Amazon AWS bill at Hyros, our entire software goes offline. We notice pretty quickly. Now, you don't need to have a problem that big, but this is what you need to do. If you have your product online, whether it's a supplement, whatever, just go turn it off for 30 minutes. If you don't have multiple customer support tickets with people getting really mad, you don't really have a product. Okay? Uh if if you want to if you have a supplement or something like that, just go to your site and turn off the order form for a day. If you don't have people pounding down the door and saying, "What the hell was going on?" and saying book me or notify me as soon as it comes back online. You don't have a product. Okay? You have to do this step right here after those steps I just talked about. Now, at this point, if you have these things I just talked about, you're cooking with grease. You got something good. Your biggest challenge right now is getting the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the person, if this is the person and this is the cookie you're selling them, it's to put that damn cookie in their mouth. Because you have to understand, you need to love your customer. Your customer is the number one most important thing. You need to be obsessed with these people and you need to love them because what they're doing is they're paying for you and your staff's entire life. And if your company is successful, making all of you very rich. Like they're the best thing ever. Okay? But you also have to look at them this way. And this is a really good thought experiment. Don't think of your customers like this, but look at them and think in this way. Imagine your customers are a 5-year-old who's super grumpy, past their bedtime, will put effort into and nothing. They're just a little fat little fiveyear-old and will not lift a finger to get any result with your product. They will not read. They will not read more than five words at a time. They will look off in different directions. Their phone will be going off. Just think of them as the most ADHD psycho three-year-old past their bedtime grumpy person who hates you. And then imagine you're trying to get them to use your product. This is the key because for example, let's talk about Dropbox. I'm sure you've heard of them. So when they launched their product, this is something that had all the criteria that I talked to you about in the previous sections. All those all those things in the list, they had it. But when people came and signed up for them and they presented the promo to people and they had people try to sign up, only about 10% of people got to the point where they actually use the software. I don't care if you send a million people into the business. I don't care if you have Mr. Beast take his shirt off, light his nipples on fire, and declare it the best software or product on earth in the history of products. You don't have a business. It doesn't matter. So, what you need to do as soon as you have this, you need to go into your product experience, whether it's a supplement, whether it's a tool people have at their house, whether it's a software, and say, what is the initial experience like? And one, is it memorable? Is it impressive? Does it leave a good vibe with the customer in the first two minutes? Okay, in the first two minutes. And more importantly, does the customer get some sort of value and recognize the value in the first two minutes? Because if people don't recognize value, they're going to bounce. and does the customer understand the value and how to get it easily within the first two minutes. If they don't, it's not going to work. So, what you're going to see is a really good way to personify this is if you look at most SAS companies setups, um the time it takes to get value is weeks. And when people sign into software companies a lot of times, think about software tools you've bought for your business. It's like they showed up to an empty warehouse with a bunch of IKEA furniture everywhere and it says good luck in the middle. No one's going to stay around and use that even if it if it removes the wart on their face kind of problem. So what you want to do is make sure that the person gets to that initial value and has that aha moment in the first two minutes and they don't have to think. So two really good examples of this type of care is go sign up for a software called Gamma. It's a AI generation PowerPoint company worth billions of dollars right now and they've been able to achieve that in like two in the last two years. Crazy growth. The reason why they've been able to do this is they spent so much time on their first their original 30 seconds to two minutes. And if you go sign up for that software, you're going to be creating AI powerpoints and seeing the benefits and value of the software within seconds and you won't have to think. It has like coloring book pictures to get there. So the same thing when we were launching Hyros Air originally for our Shopify customers originally from the sign up they had to go through the hyro setup. They had to install some code. They had to do all this stuff. We reduced the entire setup. I'll put it on the screen right now from this which is just a bunch of jargon and onboarding stuff to literally this thing I'm playing on the screen right now. It takes the setup down to about 15 seconds and immediately within those 15 seconds they don't have to put a card down. They start seeing the software working and generating customers on their site that day. Okay. And so why did we do that and why did we not even launch the product until we had something like that up or start mass marketing which we haven't done yet. this same exact concept right here. Same thing as Dropbox. Same same thing as Gamma. I don't care what you're selling. Imagine if Eat Sleep, for example. You know that mattress that everybody sleeps on right now. That mattress, imagine if it show up to people's house and like there wasn't any good instructions and the manual stunk and stuff like that and you just got a big old mattress in a box. I don't care if that thing gets down to sub-zero arctic temperatures and makes you lose weight while you're sleeping. No one's going to put it on. And so that's why they made the boxes, the setup, the the phone app, everything. impressive as hell, clean as hell, and just like literally coloring book. If you ever sat up one of those beds, it's like put cord in thing. They have like pictures, big giant pictures. They don't even use words because everyone's too [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid to read these days. They have that. Okay, so what you need to do is you start getting your first customers in and you measure how often a customer comes in and gets results. You don't need to be marketing this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] until they get 100% of the way there. I guarantee all these influencer software businesses you see that always launch, they probably have one, they always charge people upfront because they know the people aren't going to get the result. It's not because they're trying to scam. It's just because they're stupid. They're like they don't they don't understand how to build a long-term business. And so they think they just need to charge up front because they're not going to get their money any other way. And so what they're going to do is they have all the people come in. Someone pays $1,000 for their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] software. And then 5% of the people even get to fully set up with the software because that's how software works. You don't have a business. The next time this bill rolls around and people aren't going to resubscribe, business is dead after the second reoccurring bill. That's it. Why on [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] name would you send 100,000 people down this funnel when 95% of them are going to cancel just cuz they can't even get to the value of your software? I don't care if your software literally makes your dick 10 feet bigger. It's not going to work if they don't get to the value. So once you get people going down your funnels and after they buy or do your trial and you get to 90% of people getting to the value and understanding the value and getting what you're doing, what you then need to do is look at this one last final thing. Is it good enough that they're telling their friends, this is their friend, this is friends about it. This is the final step. If you have all those things I said before, people getting morbidly upset when you turn it off. 90% of people getting to the result and you can witness them telling their friends about you can put things in there like an affiliate program or distribution model uh kind of like for example Zapier all the software companies that plugged into it they made pages on their website and all the companies started sending people to their uh to the Zapier website to hook in with Zapier distribution model right there. If you look at school for example, people really like school and so they go and create classrooms on school and they share the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] of it because they get affiliate incomes from school uh or from the school classrooms doing it and they also really like the product. The same exact thing going on with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in that situation right now. That's why WOP's growing like crazy because people share it and tell all their friends about it. They create this community where people are talking about two prime examples right there in software right now. I really want you to think about the experiences you've had with products and what products you're really into. You probably have a few supplements. You probably have a few clothing brands. some things you just really like and you've told a lot of people about without any incentive from the company. You probably most of the things you use, that's how you use them or you look for some referral online. Once you have that, that's when things are crispy. That's when things are really crispy because what you're going to have is you have this funnel where people freak out. They want to keep paying you. They come in at such a high rate and have success at high rate that they keep paying you to super high rate and then they tell their friends and your their friends all go through that same exact process. This is how companies like Slack or Gamma or other companies I mentioned in this video go from nothing to worth billions of dollars hyper quickly. This is all there is to it. And then once you have all this, you have like this this steroid chipmunk covered in gasoline. All right. This is He's right here. Here's his ears. And you also It's also shaped like Wyoming. We'll give him a give him a There you go. There's There it is. You have the superpowered squirrel covered in gasoline and you're just sitting in him with a flamethrower at this point. Okay, this is a terrible example. Anyways, you got this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] squirrel and you have this thing that would have just been a little bundle of matches. It's now a giant log covered in gasoline and it just explodes when you send stuff in there and then people stay for years and so you keep this energy. What is going on with all these influencer businesses and how most people run their businesses is they don't have that and so they have this pile of matches. They send in thousands of people into the pile of matches. There's a little puff and then the energy gets lost. It it doesn't escape. You want to start off with five people. Just five five [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] come in there. You send them in and you make sure all five of those [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stay. They do not want to leave. They they will fight you if you're like, "Hey, it's time TO LEAVE." THEY'RE LIKE, "That's what you want." Okay. Then once you have that, you make sure all those other things like establish, you make sure when you send five more [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in there, they get all the way there and they end up in that same psychotic place as those other five [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And then you make sure they tell five other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about it. Then once you have all these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right here staying in here getting all humpy dumpty, then you send in a thousand [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] into this environment right here and none of them leave. So this is the exit. They're all like, "Nope, nope." They bar the exit and make it so you can't even put the exit there without them suing you or something. That's when you are going to have an incredibly wildly successful business. And if any of these influencers did it, the reason their businesses are failing is not because they're influencers or hype doesn't matter. Hype reallying matters. It's it's it's phenomenal. It's it's it's great. You want to have lots of hype. It's great marketing. It matters that you have these things so the customers stay after they hit. It's the only thing. If Logan Paul had done this with his and they they had found some way to make Prime stick and they had done test groups where people actually kept buying it. They made sure people kept buying it without prompting from Logan and KSI every single time. A zillion dollar brand. If all the other companies that I mentioned made sure that people kept buying, if all these influencers and make money influencers, the softwares they launched, uh the crypto companies they launched and all stuff, they made sure people kept buying afterwards, zillion dollar companies, zillion dollar companies immediately, but they don't. And so they become zero dollar companies. They go that's why you see companies like school. I don't know if you know Sam Ovens, he used to be an influencer, used to be a make money guy. He's like, "Hey, you know what? I'm just going to go sit in my house and never [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk to anybody ever again." He made school. He did this exact same process. Make sure that every person that comes in stays forever and then he slowly just got more [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in who told everybody about everything else and then it just slowly fly out. You will never see Sam on the internet like at all anymore. There's like videos on like with 30,000 views and the company's worth like $800 million. So you tell me what works. It's this process right here. It's simply this process right here. This is the same process I use to get high roast my business a large amount. This is the exact same process I'm using at our new product there as well. I think if you look need tracking for your SAS or Shopify company or you want literally to just add three to five percent more calls or revenue, you should check out Hyros Air or Hyros tracking. It [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard. You you'll like it a lot. But this video isn't the pitch of those things to tell you how to build your bu your business properly and what's worked for me over and over and over again. So that's the video. If you like these videos, subscribe and um you know, bye.

TITLE: Wanna get rich? ONLY make these 2 businesses
VIDEO ID: zOyhcOuvxUg

================================================================================

Highlevel business video alert. Oh my god. High level. Very advanced. Look, if you want to get rich, you should only be building one of two different types of businesses. Number one question I always get asked, always get asked, Alex, what type of business should I build or what should I be doing with my business? And it's because people are stuck in this like weird transgender herfrotype business type where they aren't really sure what their business is or what they want to do with it. They're trying to do one thing, then they're trying to do another thing. They don't know what type of business to start and they're trying to do two different things at once, which results in some very awkward situations, similar to a dude taking a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in the girl's room. Is it legal? Yes, in some states. Is it a good experience for anyone involved? No, not really. It just leads to a lot of confusion, which I am here to clear up today. Because like I said, if you want to make a lot of money, whether you are a beginner or a person that's experienced in business, you need to be building one of these two different businesses. And they should not intersect with each other. They should not cross. or you are in for a bad time and I'm going to clear that up in this video. In fact, I'm going to trick you. I'm going to manipulate you. Prepare yourself. Clean your mental rectum because I'm about to butt [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your mind. See, I hate making YouTube content. I really don't enjoy it. There's a reason why the effort I'm willing to put into these videos tops out at me flipping on this webcam and talking at this desk. I will not do the higheffort stuff you see all over YouTube. You see Iman Gaboozle out there filming himself in cars. You see all these young gun influencers filming themselves, doing days in the life, meeting celebrities, doing podcasts, doing these interviews, going out there, making these crazy content of them traveling around the world. I will not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do that. I will not leave my house. More so, I will not leave this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] room when it comes to making content. This is the peak because I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate it. And do you want to know why? It's because over my career, I built a net worth of over $200 million building SAS and tech companies, doing some pretty advanced business stuff. I like the highle stuff like building cultures, building brands, building new tech. That excites me. And you know what? No one wants to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do that. No one wants to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk about that. If I make a video on how to build a nine-figure SAS company step by step by perfecting your customer onboarding, lowering churn, increasing your MR, building a good team culture, no one [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] watches it because you guys suck. But if I make a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] video on the three coolest ways to get rich fast by flipping copy and paste AI agents to businesses or how to get rich in a year without talent and without investing money, man, you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] climb all over. You were just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at like a monkey on a football. So, in order to talk about things that I really want to talk about, I have to make these little coloring book like videos that trick you into learning advanced highle business lessons, which I'm going to trick you into learning today. What I'm going to teach you today, yes, will actually help you make money quick, very quickly, actually, because your business is going to be 10 times more efficient because you're building the right [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] business if you're a beginner or this is going to take your business to the next level because you stopped doing beginner [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in your advanced businesses. And well, you're going to learn something that's going to make you money. Woo! Lightning fast. Woo! Very sexy. Very kinky kind of quick money coming in. You're going to love it. Real here in my garage kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] But what this is actually going to do is impart a business lesson onto you that if you get in the business and actually stick to it, which like one out of 5,000 people watching this channel will actually do, it is going to make you so much more money throughout your lifetime and clear up so much confusion. So, let's begin. No more jokes, no more ddling around. I won't even talk about butt [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you anymore. We're just going to get straight to the quality content here. So, what are these two businesses that you need to build? Now, look, we're going to hop over to the whiteboard. I'm going to draw terrible drawings that are terribly unexistive with this video. They're not helpful, but they help me out. We'll be over there in a second. But I need to tell you what these two businesses are. So, you're probably thinking, "Okay, well, what type of business model is it? Like opening a Shopify store or flipping AI agents and dentists?" No, it's nothing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. It's two different types of businesses and business focuses. See, the reason why people are really bad at building businesses at first, at high levels, and even at low levels, is they don't know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] they're trying to do. Are they trying to make money? Are they trying to make billions of dollars? Are they trying to build the next big tech SAS company? Are they trying to build a long-term business? Are they trying to build a short-term business? They don't really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know. They just want to make money. And making money is a really weird thing because the best ways to make money is sometimes not making money. It's not pursuing making money. It's just pursuing different things I'm going to cover in this video. But sometimes the best way to make money is not pursuing long-term things. It's being very short-term and it's being very short-term cash flow focused. It depends on what your goals are and what you want to do and what stage of business you are and how long you're willing to wait and the type of life that you're wanting to have. Now, trust me, we're going to get very defined here. I'm going to define exactly what you need to be doing. But what I'm trying to say here is you need to be either focusing on building straight up [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cash flow businesses or you need to be straight up building long-term brands focused on customer retention. You shouldn't really be doing both of them. It's like over here you have a cow, over here you have a monkey. If you make the monkey [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the cow, you're going to end up with terrible results. The monkeys need to stick with the monkeys. The cows need to stick with the cows. They don't need to be intermingling. The second they do, everything gets really, really weird. So, let me explain. As I pull up our lowquality, loweffort whiteboard of truth and justice. Yes, like I said before, we're sticking to that loweffort, no effects, straight up used condom, tampon levels of content. That's what you guys came for. That's what I'm deliver. You're going to need to take a shower after this. So, what are these two different types of business models? Now, bear with me. You're going to have to give me 10 minutes here. If you want to go on to making lots of money, enough to pay for your entire life, or go on to make so much money that your friends go, "Wow, he's really rich." You're going to you're going to have to let me elaborate here. You're going to have to put everything away, not click on the Taylor Swift video, not be on Twitter for five minutes. If you can do that, maybe you have a future. If you can't, you're going to be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] failure anyways. So, you might as well leave and go watch whatever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing you're going to watch on YouTube. Anyways, so look, what do I mean when people are confused about the type of business they want to build? because that's what I get asked all the time. It's always what business do I build or should I go and do this next thing with my business? How do I get to the next level? And so you have to understand that there is cash flow businesses which in short are going to be short-term focused businesses where your goal is to make money now to pay for your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or pay for your lifestyle, whatever you want to do. But these businesses have severe cons. Now on the other side, there is long-term brands focused on customer retention. I'm just going to put CR right here. I'm not writing all that out for you. Now, these are also extremely good, but the focus on these is building something that grows over time and grows in value as an asset and over time consistently grows whether you are there or not eventually and can last decades and scales to very high levels. But these type of businesses also have massive cons that are the flip side of these businesses right here. And the problem is people try to build a business that's a little bit of this and they try to build a little bit of this right here or they trying to turn even worse one of these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] into one of these and it doesn't work and so they get stuck at these various levels or they end up getting wrecked early on because they're trying to build these two things at the same time instead of understanding what they're trying to do. So when people ask me what type of business should I build the first thing you have to ask yourself is what are you trying to do in your life right now? What are your actual goals? What are you trying to do? What's what's the point of this business? So, let me give you an example. So, I'm on a stream the other day answering customer questions and I have this guy with an agency that's making $100,000 a month at like a 60 70% profit margin. And so, he asked me like, "Hey, Alex, so I have this business with these numbers. What should I do to get to the next level? How do I get to 500,000 a month? How do I get to a million dollars per month?" And because agencies are hard to scale, should I pivot to a SAS business? Should I pivot to an e-commerce business to get to these levels? And so these are all different complex questions right here and you have to turn around and ask the person what are you trying to do? Are you trying to make 60 70,000 a month in profit? Are you trying to make 300,000 a month in profit that you take home while your business does 500,000 a month? Or are you trying to build a long-term brand that can scale to a$100 million $200 million valuation? And this is where the person starts to get really confused. Do you want to go build a SAS business? Or do you want to go build a Shopify business or an e-commerce business that scales to the moon? Or do you want to make money right now? Can you wait two years to make money? Can you wait five years to make money in income? Do you want to scale very fast and build a business that's very very very extremely valuable? Or do you want to make money as you scale up? These are all different conflicting things because what happens in business is the more you focus on immediate cash flow, the less you're going to get a long-term brand that grows and scales and can grow quickly. So, a really obvious example of this is when people are running ads, one of the reasons why people get stuck all the time when they're running ads is they start ads and they they create a cash flow business and let's say they get to 100K a month pretty quickly, okay? And they're at like a 3x profit margin, but then what happens is they start scaling their ads, they get to 200k a month, and the profit margin gets down to 2x, okay, or maybe 1.5x. And they're suddenly like, well, this isn't this isn't worth it. I'm I got to 200k a month, but I'm making way less profit margin and what do I do? I'm getting stuck. And then they maybe get to like 250k a month and it's just breaking even or losing a bit of money. They're at like 08 and they're like, "Well, Alex, this weird thing is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happening in my ads. It's they're not making money anymore. So, how do I go and keep the profit margins when I was at 100K a month but make a million dollars a month?" And my answer to them most of the time is you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] can't. You you can't do it. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. Go home. And they're very confused by this. Like, what? There isn't some secret in the ad uh platforms that I can use to make free money and print money on command. And the answer is no. See what happens at this point right here and the reason why most people get stuck as they're trying to scale up their ads is because when you get into bigger markets or you need to get more customers in, you start getting into a mass market. Now, you need to understand in this mass market, you're no longer operating this little minnow pool where there's little uh plankton that you're competing with and basically you're running a very unoptimized, unscalable business, but it's very profitable because it's unscalable and unoptimized and nobody's trying to actually make that money. You have to understand a business that's doing $100 million per year isn't interested in your million-doll per year market that you're working in right there. It's not big enough for them to give any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right there. So, you're not competing with them. But when you start getting to $3 million, $5 million per year, you suddenly start breaking into these bigger oceans where there's giant sharks while swimming around. I'd actually compare them more. They're very patient whales. And the way they make money is let's say they're spending a million dollars a month on ads and they'll only make in some cases like a h 100,000 back on that million they spend. You're like how how do they make money? It's because on that 100,000 back over the course of two years they're going to make two to three million back. Or if they're really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] smart over the course of years they're only going to make 1 million back. And you're probably confused like what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] why is this person only caring about making 1 million back? Because what they're doing right here is different than what you're doing. See, what they're doing is they're playing this very patient game. One of the easiest ways to win in business is to be extremely extremely extremely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] patient. A really good example of this is going to be if you've watched Alex Hermosy's info brand and compare it to other people's info brands. No one has ever sold $106 million in product in a day. No one has ever taken their SLinfo brand to I I'm not going to talk about their numbers they're doing, but they're doing phenomenal. No one's ever done that before. The reason why is because everybody running Tai Lopez personal brand like businesses went for cash flow. They didn't build a long-term customer retention brand like Alex did. If you notice, he made content for years before selling anything. Like you couldn't buy anything from other than a $1 book for years. So all the effort, all the money that Alex invested into it didn't come back to him until years later. Now to put it in another perspective right here, most SAS companies that you're dealing with, most big companies, most e-commerce brands, their objective is not making cash flow. It is growth. For example, if you see Gym Shark, I think they did like a billion dollars in revenue and made like $10 million profit or something like that in one year. Now, you're probably thinking, well, Gym Shark sounds like a terrible [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] business. No, it's because the thing they're focusing on is growth. Gym Shark is probably valued at billions of dollars or I don't I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know. I don't know their exact numbers. I'm using as example right here. If you're going out there and you're running your little e-commerce store and you're trying to make a 3x profit upfront on your ads and then you're competing in the same ad space in the same market as Gym Shark who's trying to make no money on their ads, they're fine with like a 01% profit margin. Who is going to be able to spend more on ads? Who's going to be able to spend more to get a customer? Who's going to have the better customer experience? Because all their money is going into the customer experience, ads, and growth of their business. all your money is going back into your pocket. You won't be able to compete. You you you just simply can't. That's the dumbest, most [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing I've ever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] heard. How are you supposed to have if there's two restaurants on the street and both businesses are making $100,000 a month? Which business is going to be better? the one restaurant that is pocketing $90,000 a month is the or the business that is taking that $90,000 a month that the other business is profiting and putting it back into their business and then building a stave five McDonald's jungle gym play pen and getting in a five-star Michelin chef from France in the back. Who's going to have the better business? It's going to be restaurant number two. They're going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all over it. They're going to pull down their pants and give a midnight Chipotle Arby's rager all over the other business. So you have to keep this in mind right here because this is what most people don't understand. They say, "How do I get to the next level? How do I build a Gym Shark? How do I build an Alex Hamozy like brand? How do I go and build a ClickFunnels? How do I go and build a Hyros? How do I go and build a Slack?" Well, you have to set your goals. And you have to understand that sometimes going and building one of these brands, that restaurant I talked about that is making a h 100,000 a month and reinvesting a h 100,000 a month or even worse what what actually happens is you're competing with restaurants that make $100,000 a month. They go and spend that $100,000 a month back on the business and then they go and raise another million dollar based on that and then they invest that million dollar back in the business. You just will not compete with them. But here is the point right here because you're probably thinking, "Oh, okay, cool. So Alex is just saying I don't get to make money ever and I just have to like not make money and and sacrifice for 10 years straight. No, what I'm saying is understand your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] priorities. If you want to make 100 $200,000 month profit, you need to build a very very different business than a business that's trying to scale to a $100 million valuation. If you come out the gates and you're trying to make a hundred $200,000 a month profit very quickly, the chance of you building a $100 million valuation business is essentially zero. It's not going to happen because you don't have the the same oomph behind your business as the businesses that are. So, for example, I have one of the larger tracking and analytics companies in this space, Hyros. It gets really good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] results for the customers. We have literally customer support agents onetoone when people come on that chase you around, make sure you get success. The amount of effort and money we've invested to make sure when you sign up for this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing that you get to the point where you get a result is ridiculous. The amount we've invested in the product is ridiculous. This is why I see all these tracking companies pop up all the time. They claim to be able to compete with Hyros and they just can't because there's one thing they're really messing up here is they're trying to make money. They're like, "Okay, we're going to operate at a 50% profit margin. We're trying to scale our SAS company to compete with Hyros." No, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'll run [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ads and I'll wait three years to make my money back. Dude, if I can throw a million dollars at ads and make $3 million back over three years, that's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] great. That's a better investment I can ever get investing in anything. And I'll do that. So, your little tracking company where you're not investing anything back in your customer results and success and everything just it's just not going to do it, buddy. It's not going to work out. And so, you can see these businesses that go and try to compete with mine, they can't by default because they don't understand the type of business that they're trying to create. Which then all circles back to the point I'm trying to make here. When people ask me what type of business they want to build or what they should do in their business, you have to ask yourself what type of business do you want to build? And these are the things you need to focus on based on your priorities. Look, if you want to make 100 200k a month, 50k a month right now, that's fine. You shouldn't feel guilty about that. It's completely fine to just want to make a lot of money and and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off or just focus on that right now. In fact, if you're just starting off in business, focusing on cash flow businesses probably is the better thing to do because you don't have any money. And so that limits your ability to invest in your businesses. And also, if you're building a long-term focused business, say you're building something like a Gym Shark, say you're building something like a Hyro, say you're building something like a hell, a Pudgy Penguins, a Tinder, whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're you're trying to build. Say you're building a long-term business right now, you really don't want to go and take massive investments and put in massive investments in something when you have no experience in business whatsoever. So, let's talk about cash flow first. If you're building a cash flow type business, what do you want? You need a business where you're able to sell something at extremely high profit margins. So, here's the the nuts and bolts of it. If you're trying to sell something at high profit margins, you're not going to be able to do that much R&amp;D. So, you're not going to have a unique product. In order to create a very, very unique product, you're going to need to invest a lot of time, research, and everything that goes into it and do a lot of special things and investment from upfront. So, you're not going to have a lot of R&amp;D into it. You're not going to be able to benefit from a unique product. you're probably going to have a very easy to reproduce product. So, for example, if you look at a lot of small e-commerce businesses, they sell shirts, they sell supplements, they sell things that are very easy to create that are very similar to everything else out there. Because when you sell things that are similar to everything else out there, it means that they're easy to reproduce. The way to reproduce them has been made. There are tools and everything exists that makes it easy to do, which allows you to have high profit margins. If you look at most cash flow businesses, the best examples are agencies or people reselling AI agents to businesses. people selling freelance work or design. Drop shipping was very popular in e-commerce, but the profit margins of that are so small these days. I don't really I don't I don't know how that's doing. But small level e-commerce businesses where they're selling products that are very similar to other products or businesses out there. These are based on really clever but also very easy to reproduce and copy business model. This is why course seller businesses are so popular with the lower level entrepreneurs. I'm not saying gurus and people on YouTube selling courses are low-level entrepreneurs in a negative way. I'm saying if your business is in these areas, you're not dealing with a wellbit built well ststructured business. The second you stop making content, the second you stop pumping out courses, you you you lose all your money. That's not a good business. And a lot of the times if you look at course businesses, you look at these e-commerce businesses, you look at these agencies, they become very hard to scale because they don't keep customers. There's two reasons for this. One, the product isn't unique. There's a thousand other people competing with them. And so, it's reproduced very easily. That means when you get to scale, it becomes hard because then you start dealing with people in that big shark category that are willing to invest tons of money that you're not willing to invest back in the business because you're making something that's so easy to reproduce and cash flow focused. They also don't keep customers. One, because the product's not unique. You have to have a unique edge to keep customers. To have a unique edge, you usually have to invest back in your business and your brand. And in two, because of the structure of the business, you really can't get that good of customer results. Because to get phenomenal customer results, you have to do something special that other people can't do. So, what does this all mean? I'm sure if you're watching me say this right now, I seems like I'm talking down to people that build businesses like this. No, you just have to understand this is not the way you want to go. You want to go and make something that's easy to reproduce and fast and able to make money with that. So, examples of this are agency businesses, courses, low-level e-commerce, very low-level SAS, like the Vibe coding where you go and make a Vibe coding app and then you sell it to local businesses. Are these apps going to go and be the next $100 million, $200 billion zillion dollar SAS company? No, not at all. Are they capable of generating 30 40K a month at like a 90% profit margin? 100%. The problem with those businesses again is once you start getting to 100 200k a month, they're going to get replicated if they're profitable enough. Once you get into a business niche where it's able to generate enough revenue, that's when big dogs start coming in and they start [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So, what you want to do is if you want to be a cash flow [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is you want to focus on building little cash flow businesses that make 30 50k a month and you want to master these little niches right there. This is why you see in low-level e-commerce instead of having one giant brand, e-commerce people usually have like 10 different stores that are all very cash flow focused. It's because you can't scale these type of businesses, which is fine. So if you want to get to the next level and you're focused on cash flow, you want to have lots of littleler businesses or you want to replicate a very clever model that doesn't scale but makes its money based on being clever. So making a little vibe coding app, no, it's not going to scale because you're focusing on a little clever thing that generates 30 50k a month, but you can make a lot of them or you can reproduce them very quickly or you can make them without effort and cash flow them. And so that's what you want to focus on. If you're cash flow focused, do not focus on building a long-term brand. Don't focus on making the next billion dollar thing. Don't focus on scaling your company to the moon. Focus on the cash flow and then focus on slowly scaling that up with the margins that you have. But understand those margins are going to get tighter the longer the business exists and the more you try to scale it up. This is fine. This is the model that you're in. Now, my suggestion to you is then use this cash flow to build one of these. And then once you build one of these, do not confuse this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing with this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing. Okay? Here's why. So, for example, at Hyros, I'm building our next product, Hyros Air, right now. It's an AI agent. You can slap it on a Shopify store. It increases sales by two, three, uh, sometimes seven, 10%. It [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] works. It's actually incredible. I'm not here to pump Hyros Air to you. I'm here to describe the launching of new product and how I'm doing it. So, I could easily put Hyros Air out there, run ads, and get this business to a million a month super duper incredibly quickly at a pretty damn high profit margin. But here's the thing. the business would be short-term and it would suck ass because we haven't taken the time to perfect and master the product and then what's going to happen if I do that someone else will go replicate the product very very quickly and then do it at no profit margin and go snuff it out because they will have the better product instead what I am doing at Hyros Air right now is we are slowly launching it getting customers in and I'm making sure we have a funnel right here that makes it so when the customer comes in for free they get all the way to the point where they get a result and become a customer for life and I want to see this happen with near 90% consistency. So when Dropbox originally started, uh you remember Dropbox, you probably used it back in the 2010s, about 5% of the people that joined Dropbox actually ended up using Dropbox and sticking with the product. If you remember back then, it was one of the most viral sticky products of all time. So that might be surprising to you. What did Dropbox do? They didn't make any money for literally forever. Like forever, they didn't make any money at all because of that 5% thing right there. And they kept raising money and working on the product, raising money, working the product, building the brand. And eventually they got their success rate to 90%. And then they started scaling the product and then they started scaling it it out. And as soon as they made money doing that, they took all that money, reinvested it, and then raised [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tons of money at a huge valuation. So they basically not only kept not making money, they didn't raise money and then used all that money while still not making money to grow the pro the product. And so what did they focus on? Instead of making money in the business, what they focused on was getting first the product absolutely perfect. You can't do this if you're trying to build a cash flow business. You can't just sit and work on the product and have people come into your funnels and analyze every tiny little thing they do and perfect it and then push the product. You don't have time to do that. That you also don't have time as you're doing this to reinvest every dollar you make back into the product and then use that as a as a an example to go back and raise money. Now, I don't have to raise money for my businesses because I've built a lot of profitable businesses and I've had a lot of money to invest. That's the benefit I have from originally being good at making cash flow businesses. I made all sorts of little micro SASes. I sold courses. I had SEO outsourcing services, basically an agency, but it was an automated agency. I did all those things. None of those businesses could really scale past 100K a month, but I had like five or six of them all pumping out 50 to 100,000 a month. That's where a lot of the cash flow came from and originally started Hyro. So, I did this thing right here and I focused on this thing and then I built the long-term brand hyros. But you don't have the luxury of doing this thing that that Dropbox did right here. But you have to think on yourself. A lot of people they go and build companies that are SAS company like how do I get to the next level? Well, here's how Dropbox got to the next level. They spent so much time making sure every customer that came in the door with almost 100% ratio came through, got the product, went all the way through the product. This took them a year, two years to get perfect. Got to the product and then got to that result which was very good. And in every dollar that came from that result they did, they reinvested in making the product and scaling it larger. That resulted in a company that at this point is worth eight billion dollars. So the person that did this made a lot more [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money than the person that made this. But if you're a person that is trying to generate cash flow, you're not going to be able to do that. And so people ask me how well how do I get to the next level of my SAS business or to think I'm going to do this? I say you're going to need to take time and make sure every single customer that comes in gets a result. Every single customer is happy. And that's going to take a lot of time of not launching the product. For example, if I took high-risisk air right now and sent it out to my entire email list, I let in everybody I knew. I ran ads. I was pumping it on this YouTube channel. I was talking about it blowing up this. It would be like every other SAS business you ever see these uh influencers launch online. Have you ever noticed that any of like the gurus on YouTube, they launch SAS and software companies and none of them ever go anywhere? It's because they overload them with [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tons of customers to cash flow them very quickly and then 90% of the customers do not stay. The only way your brand and you're going to become a billionaire or 100 millionaire or 50 millionaire or whatever you get to these points is you have to get customers in and they have to stay for a really long [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time and they have to continue to buy from you for a very longing time. What does this take? Making a product that's unique and has a huge edge, huge amounts of R&amp;D behind it, really special people working at your company. a brand that people love interacting with and a very optimized, very high effort process that you put years into of getting the customer to buy the first product, use the product, and then stay forever. This takes a very long time and it's not very profitable up front, but it builds massive assets that grow. And so, the thing I focus on when I'm making money is a this first. If I were to get 10,000 customers in the hire tomorrow, but 90% 70% of them didn't get to the end result, guess what? The business is a failure. It doesn't work. There's no point in me even making a single dollar or keeping a single dollar there if I'm trying to become a billionaire, which is what I'm trying to do with my businesses. And the way I'm trying to become a billionaire is not by taking money out of this pot right here and stacking it up like a little goblin. I'm trying to build an asset similar to Dropbox that is worth a billion dollars. The process of doing that is very different than going and making cash flow here. So again, when people ask me, how do I take my SAS or agency to the next level? You got to focus on growing the asset. This means not cash flowing it. A lot of people don't want to do that. They don't want to go and spend $100 on ads and then make their money back two years later. They don't want to run a business that runs at zero profit margin. And so what they try to do is they try to turn their agency or their e-commerce store into a long-term brand while still cash flowing it. And it's like we talked about early in the video. We have a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cow over here [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a monkey and you end up with this weird hybrid mun thing that doesn't keep customers but also doesn't make maximum amounts of money. And so this is where people [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. You need to ask yourself in your business where you're at right now. Where do you want to go? Do you want to be worth $100, $200 million? Great. You need to be doing this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] over here. You need to stop trying to cash flow like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] child and realize you don't get paid like an NBA player. You're a entrepreneur. You grow assets. You don't grow income streams. That's silly. Yes, there are people out there that do that and have cash flow profitable businesses. And there's examples like this out there. For example, Only Fans or Tether or uh Pump.f fun. Absolutely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money. absolutely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money. These are weird examples and you really have to go and build something very quickly that nobody else sees and it blows up. Can you do that? Yeah, sure you can. Sure you can. But it the the massive value of Only Fans also comes from its massive valuation as well. Um so you got to keep that in mind. And the way to consistently go out there and build huge things is to just do this. And if you look at really smart entrepreneurs like any of them out there, any of the huge tech entrepreneurs, any of the big tech founders, the ones that have billiond dollar valuations, they never made any income at all during the entire time. But what they did is they grew their asset value. And trust me, when your asset value is 100, $200 million. All you need if you ever need money is you just borrow money against it. It's not a problem for Mark Buck Zuckerberg to go and borrow 50, $100 million to buy a yacht and then slowly pay it off at low rates from the little profit that the business makes. That's how they work and that's how you need to focus on building. So ask yourself, what do you want to do? If you want to cash flow, focus on cash flow. Keep building a little micro businesses. Keep building more kind of short-term businesses. Understand he's not going to have and you shouldn't be focusing on these things over here. Or if you want to reach the high levels, you need to focus on building a business like this. And this is how you go and make a lot of money. You don't want to cross the wires between these things. And this is why this question I get all the time, what should I do with my business? How do I get to the next level? is weird because you have people trying to build a monkey and a cow at the same time and creating this mutant hybrid thing that doesn't cash flow which is their objective at the time but also doesn't grow as a long-term brand either. Do one or the other one at a time or focus on one business that cash flows that funds the other business. This is the way to properly grow and this is going to make everything way easier for you because you're not trying to do two conflicting things at the same time and it's going to make you a lot more successful. So that's the video. If you want actual videos on business lessons, running ads, sales, uh, strategies, and how I actually grow my businesses, I release all the courses that I used to make on copywriting, ads, everything. It's like $20,000 worth of courses. I give that away for free in my community tab only to subscribers. You will only see the post if you subscribe. I post it once a month. I keep it up for a day. I take it down. If you want to see that, you need to be subscribed below. Also, you can see the food I'm eating and pictures of of me doing things on Instagram at uh 4 a.m. Becker. You should follow me there because it's sweet. And uh here's some other videos on how to build your business. For example, there's a video on this channel from getting to zero to 100K a year, 100K a year to a million a year, and a million to 10 million per year. They're all on this channel. It's all for free because uh I'm already rich. I don't need to sell you any courses. So, all right. Bye.

TITLE: Injecting This Daily Made Me A 200 IQ God
VIDEO ID: YC9_Sga5F2M
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC9_Sga5F2M
================================================================================

Give me that stack. Tell me about that stack, bro. I need to know your stack. Over the past decade online, I've built a net worth north of $200 million. And the number one question people ask me is not, Alex, how'd you build your businesses? What's your business strategy? Tell me about hiring or something like that. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Number one question is, give me back that stack, bro. That stack, bro. What stack are you putting in your body? Yes. The number one question is my biohacking routine. What is the supplements I'm taking? What is the peptide and injection stack I'm taking? What am I putting in my body to achieve the IQ and wisdom of the turtle from Kung Fu Panda? But the mental acuity of Plankton from Spongebob Squarepants. And in this video, I'm just going to give you the answer. Just roids. Just straight TRT. Just put in a needle, put it in your body, inject it in your I'm just kidding. My stack actually involves zero steroids, which you wouldn't be able to tell by these. That said, in this video, I'm going to give you my full biohacking stack. And this is a special stack because I'm actually the original Brian Johnson. Yes. Before he ever got inside a hyperaric chamber or learned about red light therapy. I've been doing this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] since I was like 25 for 10 years. And in this time frame, I don't think I'm quite as optimized as uh good old BJ. But I have achieved a peptide stack, a biohacking routine, a diet, a skincare routine that has given me some pretty damn good results. My net worth is also extremely high. But I've also maintained a six-pack since I was about 27. I am 37 now, closer to 38. I am able to wake up at 2 am every single day and keep focus, energy, motivation, all that kind of stuff. I'm able to do jujitsu five times a week as an old man, which I'm not doing right now, but I've done it before and been just fine. It's allowed me to not age like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and keep decent skin despite being an absolute wild weekend drunk most of my life. I should look like a potato that's been left out in the sun by now. But I do not because I got the biohacking routine. I got the the stuck that's going to get you the results. And what I'm going to do in this video is I'm going to give you my entire day, mostly focused on the biohacking and the stuff I'm injecting and putting in my body to maintain as close as possible peak mental fitness, keep my body good, give myself energy, and not be dragged down by being old and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And in my opinion, this has helped me a lot in business because I have a clear mind. I have a ton of energy, a lot of motivation, and uh you know, those things are pretty good if you're trying to make money because if you feel like soggy ass, it's it's more difficult to make money. That's the lesson for the day. If you inject your eyeballs with steroids, it's easier to make money than uh being a soggy old piece of ass. So, let's begin. So, in a second, I'm going to give you my entire vitamin stack, my entire daily routine, how I do everything. I just want to give you my two cents on this whole morning routine, biohacking health thing, because everybody has wide ranging stuff. Brian Johnson is going to tell you to spend six hours a day taking care of your body. Alexi, my buddy, is going to tell you just wake up, pound some coffee, take some nicotine, walk over to your computer, get to work. Where is the in between? Where is the benefit? Who's correct here? So, look, if you're a person who's looking to completely optimize who you are, I'm going to tell you how to do it in this video because it's been a massive focus of mine since I was 25. It's been like my side hobby. I've been doing this for a long time. It's very important to me that I wake up and I'm primed 247. Because of that, I can give you an accurate two cents on this. Look, at the end of the day, the thing that's going to get you the most results is what Alex Heroszi is saying. Get to your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] computer, take some coffee, pound some nicotine, get to work. That being said, it is also very important to me to age well and to feel good most of the time and not feel like soggy ass when I'm working. In my opinion, I have pretty weak mental willpower. If I feel a little bit off, I'm not going to be at my peak and I'm a giant [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So that's just not going to correlate to my business very well. And I think there's a lot more aspects to life than just doing well in business. I think there's also how you feel. And I think there's living for a long time. And one of my goals is to live to 120 150 plus. I think we're going to see 300 year lifetimes in our lifespan. But that's a whole other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] subject. And so when it comes down to your morning routine and the things you do every single day, can you get absolutely soul crushing amazing results doing absolutely nothing? Yes. I think waking up and having a routine that makes you feel good and keeps your body in peak prime, it makes everything a lot easier, though. It's not going to unlock the moon and the stars for you, and frankly, you should get the first part right. But nailing the basis of what I'm going to tell you here will allow you to feel so much better and work so much better, put on muscle so much better, and stay prime despite having some really bad vices. For example, I've been a mega caffeine addict and a wild drunk most of my life. So, I've been able to overcome a lot of nasty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that I've done, including having a terrible diet by completely overriding it with some of the biohacking nonsense I'm going to show you in this video. I don't really do that stuff anymore. But imagine being able to pick up chicks while covered in your own feces. That's that's basically what I've able to get away with, while able to get the result, but have your cake, too. And I don't know if having your cake means covering yourself in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like a gorilla, but let's get into this. Here's where we go. So, look, I'm going to start off from the entire day. And yes, for the people that did come for the thumbnail and the clicky clicky injection stuff, I do inject a lot of stuff in my body. I take like 10 injections a day, it's kind of weird, but it's highly effective. So, we'll get into that, but I want to break down the entire day to you because so much goes into optimizing your brain and everything beyond just injecting roids directly into your ass. So, here's how we start the day. Every single day, I'm going to get up at 2 a.m. The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to hop and take a cold shower. If you've watched a two-hour hubman video on it, you know that cold showers are very productive. You don't actually need to watch a two-hour [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] video to know that if you hop in a cold shower, it will wake you up and get you get you a little bit pumped up for the day. That that's the lesson right there. No Hooverman video needed. Just get in aing cold shower. It will wake you up. It gets all your dopamine and everything flowing. It's a hard thing to initially start your day. It's great. Take a cold shower. You don't need to take the Wimhof method and do three hours of research to understand that getting in cold water is going to help boost you at the start of the day. Then immediately what I'm going to do is hop into my skincare routine. Now I know you're going to sit there and be like, [laughter] "What a beta cookie has a skincare routine." Yes, you will look like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] by the time you're 40 if you do not do take care of your skin. If you get on videos, you try to pick up hot babes. You need to take care of your skin. I'm sorry. It's not going to go well. I'm not saying I have the best skin on earth, but I don't have any big wrinkles or any big crazy stuff on my face despite being a raging drunk. And trust me, I have a lot of friends that did all the same stuff I did. They It's not going well. Okay, so look, I know it's a little gay. I know it's a little feminine. That's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fine. You don't want to look like a rugged potato next to your babe of a wife when you make tons of money. Okay, so skin routine is very simple. It's going to be stac out over the next 30 minutes or so so it all absorbs. I would not advise going and getting in the skincare routines and everything first off right now if you suck at everything else. It's not that important. But you want to put toner on after cleansing. Then you put some polish choice on. This is going to close up your pores and everything after you've cleansed and everything from the night before, which is a whole other skincare routine. Then you're going to put a vitamin C serum on. It's going to heal a lot of I'm not going to break down everything is walking right here. This is works. I've done lots of research on it. You can take it or leave it. Put on a vitamin C serum. Then you put on some good eye cream, some good moisturizer. Then you put on sunscreen. This is going to stop your skin from turning into a moldy potato as you age and overcome all sorts of bad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you've probably done. So do it. I will put all the products in my upcoming supplement list. I'm going to release on here in our community tab. You have to be subscribed if you want to see the post though. So, you should go below and subscribe right now. You're not going to see that when I post in the community tab later this week. It will be in my entire list of supplements and everything right there. That's the order of what you want to do in the morning for skincare. You don't need expensive skincare. Now, this takes about 5 to 10 minutes. It's not like we have a 2-hour morning routine. But immediately after I do that, what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a quick 3 minute to five minute HIT workout. This just gets the blood pumping, gets the adrenaline going, gets the dopamine, wakes up your body. Again, we can go into all the scientific Herman workout research scientific. This improves your dopamine receptor. No, dude. Getting on a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] treadmill and sprinting for 3 minutes wakes you the up in the morning. It's useful. The end. Next, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a giant mega dose of creatine because it just helps with being alert and awake. It's going to give you a lot of uh energy. Taking 10 grams, 15 grams of stuff. It works really well and frankly I don't sleep that great. This is going to be a biohacking video where I'm like, "Hey, I only sleep like five, six hours a night. Sue me." So, it also helps with a little bit of energy in that regard. So, then immediately what I'm going to do is going to hop into the injections. I'm going to inject NAD+. This is a really good anti-ager. Helps with energy. I'm going to inject some B12 three times a week. A full red little syringe of it. Straight into the thigh. Helps with energy and energy levels. A peptide that I will take is tzamorin. This is going to be something that helps boost your growth hormone things really good for anti-aging and whatnot. Now, people are going to be wondering, Alex, are you on TRT or whatnot? I don't think TRT is really the question right here. I will be transparent with you. When I'm doing jiujitsu and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] five times a week, this is something that a 37 38 year old man should not be doing. When I was doing that in the past, yes, I'd be on TRT because frankly, and you need every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] advantage you can get. Okay, but my point right here is that you should be getting your testosterone levels around 800 to 900, 1,000 if you want to be extra saucy. It doesn't matter how you do this. If you're being healthy, look, if you are super healthy, you're doing everything right, you're sleeping, and your testosterone levels are at five, you probably need to get on TRT. If not, you testosterone levels will probably get up there. I've known plenty of people, including myself, who've gone to 800, 900 without being on TRT. If you're a young man and you're getting on TRT, that's just goofy. Okay? Like, try sleeping and not living on chili hot Cheetos for a week, maybe you'll see some good results there. I don't think if you're under 30, you should be considering TRT. I don't think if you're under 35, you should be considering TRT. Those are the situations in which I'm going to take it, which is when I'm trying to have a midlife crisis and pursue an athletic career and adult bathrobe ground croy. Uh, that's that's when I'm going to be taking it. So, that's the context of that. on GH boosters like tessimorin and peptides. I don't really think you need those unless you're really trying to again do something beyond your age, which is getting super duper fit as you're older. These things are fine. I don't think they're super required. They're neat. They're not going to be something that's going to drive you to the next level of anything. It does give you a bit more energy. You do put on muscle a little bit better. They're useful, but it's not super required. It's also expensive, so it's like the last thing you need to be buying. Then at this point, I'm going to hop in front of a red light therapy machine for 10 minutes. These are pretty common. helpful with skin, helpful of energy, all sorts of benefits and hoopla. Everybody that biohacks does it. You should probably do it, too. So, then that wraps up the morning hoopla of what we're going to do. The next thing I'm immediately going to do is I'm going to pound about 400 milligrams of caffeine via coffee. And about three times a week, I'm going to take a little 2 milligram dose of nicotine from gum. And I'm usually going to take those before I shoot videos because it helps with creativity and letting the the words flow off your tongue. Before I shot this video, I took some nicotine. For all the people that always accuse me of doing cocaine before doing videos, no, I would never do that. I just do nicotine instead. It's It's way better than cocaine. Way way clearer, way better energy boost. So, I'm going to do some nicotine. I know a lot of people do nicotine every single day before work. I don't want that cuz the last thing I want is another addiction in my life. I'm already addicted to coffee. I already like drinking a little bit too much. I avoid alcohol these days, but trust me, I still thoroughly enjoy going to the bar and d and pounding 10 oldfashions. It's it's a great time. I don't do that anymore, but trust me, the desire is there. The last thing I want is another one of those little pickles in my life in the form of nicotine. I don't want that monkey on my back. So, I keep it very sparingly with that. Now, the very important part of all this is you shouldn't eat in the morning. If you want to eat in the morning and you don't like this advice, go do it. I know other people are like, "Well, I got to have my eggs or my little biscuit." All right, fine. go eat your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] biscuit. But when you eat, your digestion takes away energy from the rest of your body and that's going to slow you down. So if you on all sorts of uppers like I am, you're not going to be very hungry. So you should just not eat. You're going to be much faster, much more efficient. So at this point in time from about it depends when I get up. Whether it's 1:00 a.m., 2 am, it just depends when I get up. I'm going to work for about three or four hours. This is going to be my silent focused work for the day. I can get lots of the creative work content done, designing hyros, the product. I do all the product design for that. A lot of the copywriting, web design, stuff that I can do on my own that requires creative thinking, running of ads, and setting up stuff like that. That's what I'm going to get all that done in the first three to four hours. I truly believe if you sit down and don't talk to buddy and you just work in those three to four hours without any distractions, you're going to get more done than most people get done in a week in those three to four hours. And you could literally almost pull off working three to four hours a day if you just nail that time period. I'm trying to become a billionaire, so I have to work a little bit more than that. But I'm pretty confident I could keep up my income right now and stay where I'm at right now, just working three to four hours a day tops. That being said, that's my thoughts on that. Now, after that 3 to four hours, what I'm then going to do is I'm going to go hit the gym and lift. I got my own gym in my place, and I just go in there and lift about three to four times per week. I used to do a full body workout every single day. Um, it depends how aggressive you want to be with your workout routine. I think you get really good results three to four times per week. About four times per week doing a full body workout four times per week. I'm not here to give fitness [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] advice. I'm not the world's greatest muscle builder fitness dude. I have managed to keep a six-pack and stay Tyler Duran Fight Club ripped for almost a decade now. That's my goal. I'm not trying to get giant jacked gym bro. I'm trying to look like Tyler Deran from Fight Club. That's that's basically my goal. And I've achieved that for almost a decade. And that's the kind of routine that I've used to get there. while mixing that with fasting and some smart forms of dieting that I'll I'll talk about here in a second. Now, if I'm not lifting, I'm probably going to go on uh I'm going to hop on the treadmill and walk for 30 to 45 minutes while watching a podcast or something like that. Uh get that walking. That helps with the calories and helps when you eat throughout the rest of the day to uh make it so it's not that easy to overeat and put on weight because I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pig and I like to eat a lot of food. So, I'm not even getting into the diet right now. That's a whole other that's a whole other thing. So, at that point, one thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go and then I'm going to eat and I'm going to watch CEO interviews, podcasts, stuff like that. That's the best way I learn. I primarily watch interviews from SAS and tech founders. I don't watch [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] podcasts talking about the purpose of life and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. I like going and looking at things that I'm doing in my work that apply to my tech company and I look at other tech company founders and what they did when they're in a similar spot. That's why I like to learn and I so I do that for about an hour at this point while cooking and eating. I know a lot of people are like, "Don't cook your food and whatnot and whatever." Yeah, you probably shouldn't, but I find if I'm watching these things while cooking and eating, uh, that gets it done. Then what I do is I take a nap, probably one hour to two hours. This is how I get a total of about six hours of sleep per day. I kind of break up the sleeping into two parts, kind of two shifts of the day. One thing that I do that I don't currently do, because I don't have it installed in my house, it's being installed right now. I had it at my old place, is I would go and take my nap in a hyperaric chamber. It's going to be an hour and a half to two hour nap. I just go sleep in there. If you've seen Brian Johnson's results in there, it's probably the best anti-aging, best slowing of aging, best overall health thing you can do. And so I do that every single day. I'm just going to eat. It makes me a little bit sleepy. Go sleep in the chamber for an hour to two hours. Get that two hours of sleep. Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to wake back up and go to the second part of the day. I'm going to drink some more coffee and I'm going to get back to work and do my second 3 to four hour work shift. Just focused work and get it done. I've already kind of digested all the food. I got some more coffee in me. There we go. Then at this point, I'm gonna do my second workout of the day. I'm going to go run for about 30 to 40 minutes. Zone two cardio. Nothing too crazy. I'm not trying to overwhelm my body because then you're going to sleep bad and you're going to be tired all the time. If you're working out twice a day, you don't want to be doing two like excessive workouts per day. When I was doing lifting and also doing jiu-jitsu every single day, I had to be on TRT and like Tesmorlin and keeping everything refined and I was just zonked the entire time. That's overtraining. You're not going to do well. You're going to be not sleeping. your cortisol levels are going to be off the charts. So, you just want to do some light running. And I do that, burn some calories, get the heart rate, basic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. Then, I'm going to hop into the sauna at about 180° and I'm going to do that for about 20 minutes. Just sweat out all the gunk, get fresh, take another cold shower, go do all my kind of cleanup work and light work for the rest of the day. That's going to be talking to people. That's going to be doing anything that's not been done for the day. That's going to be planning the next day. Then I'm going to go eat again. And that's what I'm going to take my giant 8000 pill supplement stack right there. So look, instead of breaking every single one of these down, I'm just going to put the list on the screen right now. Uh my my overall supplement stack is pretty much a combination of Brian Jinson and Simland. That's pretty much it. There's a few things I've thrown in there, but you can pretty much go and my advice when it comes to supplement stacks instead of telling you and walking you through every single one on here. I will be giving a link directly to this file here in about a week. I'm just editing and updating it and I'll post it in the community tab. You you have to be a subscriber. You won't see this post, but I'll post in the community tab here a little bit later this week. You can go there. You can just look at the file and copy it if you want. My best advice for supplement stacks is this. Start with Simland's essential vitamins list. He has just has a he has a big old PDF file. You can go to hising site and it will just give you all the essentials right here. He's really good at supplements and picking the best ones. That's the overunder of what's just going to get you the results you're looking for when it comes to supplements. Then if you want to start going and adding to that, what you should not do until you've mastered that little supplement list right there is then you can kind of go branch out into Brian Johnson's list. He's really good at actual resultbased supplement taking. There is other people out there who are buyer hackers that have their supplement list or whatever. My logic is when you've gotten the Simland list down and you've gotten the Brian Johnson list down, you pretty much are putting enough [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in your body to to heal a horse and make it live to be a thousand years old. You do you really need anything else other than that? You're good. You're all right. You're you're getting there. And so I'm probably taking I don't even know how many pills are not every single day. It's a lot, but you know, I find it kind of fun. So that's what I do. So, at this point, the day's sort of pretty much done. What I'm going to do is I'm going to meditate. I'm going to then probably hang out with my wife for three to four hours. Just do really nothing with her. Uh, that's that's just hang out. It's nice. I don't know if that's biohacking, but you should enjoy hanging out with your wife. That's a default you should look for in your relationship. Then, I'm going to take my nighttime stack, which is basically going to be magnesium glycine. There's all sorts of other stuff you can throw in there for sleep. I just don't find it works very well. Then I'm going to do the nighttime skin routine, which is basically just short of washing your face, putting on toner again, using retinol, and then reapplying moisturizer. There's all sorts of other cool little gizmo things you can do, but that's going to get you 90% of the oomph. Then I'm going to throw on some red light glasses, red light blockers or blue light glass blockers, you know, the things that everybody wears before they go to bed. Put those on, watch some TV, hang out. I know you shouldn't watch TV be before bed, but [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. I like it. And that is the whole entire routine. That is everything I do in a day to keep my mind where it is. That's my entire schedule and everything I do. Cool. All right. So, yeah, that's everything I do. If you want that supplement list, it's on the screen in the middle of this video. You can just go copy it from there. I will leave a link to that and all the skincare products and everything. They will not be affiliate links cuz like I'm not even go through the process of collecting all those pennies from the affiliate links. You just honest recommendations. Most of the stuff I use is extremely affordable stuff because it just works better than the expensive stuff. I'll link to that, but you need to be subscribed or you will not see it in my community post tab, which you can get to by going to the homepage of my channel and then you should see a communities tab.

TITLE: This is why becoming rich will ruin your life

================================================================================

So look little buddy. If you have any ambition to become successful or you're already successful, I beg you, please give me 10 minutes to watch this video because I am going to save you decades of depression, decades of problems. Look, one of the best ways to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up your life is to become rich. I can tell you this because I've built a net worth north of $200 million and I've interacted with countless men who've made seven figures, eight figures, nine figures, even a couple of made 10 figures, billionaires. And I've watched all sorts of chaos arise from the chronic unhappiness that comes from making money. and all these silly, goofy, weird problems that appear once you make money. And the problem is when most men make money, they make money for a certain reason and it leaves them in a dark, soulless place that makes them much worse off than when they were poor. And then on top of this, there's all these problems that pop up that if you're not looking for, they come and then they cling on to you like a parasite that you can't get rid of. And so what ends up happening is you end up more depressed than you were before, unhappy, but then you have all these problems that are also going to stress you out and drain you. And this is guaranteed going to happen to you. And if you're already successful, this might already be happening to you. There's going to be points where you're looking back and you're going to be thinking, "Oh, wow. Maybe I was more happy when I was poor. Maybe money is the source of unhappiness." This isn't true. It's not understanding why you're making money and the emotions and why you're feeling a certain way after you make money. And it's also just not seeing these problems coming that most men run into. Money is not going to make you extremely happy. It's also not going to make you incredibly depressed. What's going to make you incredibly depressed once you make money, is lack of understanding of all the things that come with making money and what the money is going to do to you. And for example, when I was in my college years, I never went to college, but I got out of the military broke as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and partied in college towns. And I would look back and say, "Wow, I was much happier at that point in my life." Maybe the secret to being happy is just being broke. That that's not the truth. The secret is understanding what life is all about. And if you don't understand this, you're going to end up more miserable. And in many cases, this is going to drive you to all sorts of problems that will send you back to being broke. And there's only one thing worse than being broke. It's being broke after being rich and still having to deal with all the problems that came from when you were rich in the deep shame of being a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So please, I beg you, give me 10 minutes. This is going to save your life. If you're trying to become successful right now, or if you're already successful and you're starting to go down this little spiral that a lot of men go down, this is going to fix everything because not only am I rich as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right now, I'm also pretty damn happy all the time, or at least consistently good. I'm not sitting around moping and I don't sit around looking for purpose and drive in my life and wondering why I'm not happy after making oodles of big bags of bucks. So, let's discuss these things. And by things, there's actually five things you have to look out for. If you get these all done, you nail these all out, you're going to be good no matter what. and you're not going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up your life when you make some money. So now let's discuss. So there's five ways like I just said that's going to mess up your life. And a lot of these come from lack of identity and ego which I cannot spell. So I'm just going to draw this this hoopla up here. It actually all comes down mostly to lack of identity and blah blah and misunderstanding why you're making money in the first place. So let's talk about problem number one. And this is what I like to call the end of Zelda concept, beating the game concept. So, if you want to know what making money is like, making tons of money is like, if you don't understand why you're making money, and why you're building businesses in the first place, it's like this. If you ever played a video game, which I assume you have cuz you're a giant dork watching this channel who's 5'2 with a neck beard, that's exclusively what my audience is. What making a lot of money is like originally, if you don't understand why you're making the money or why you're building businesses, is it's like beating a video game. So, I learned this one time when I was playing Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and it was so much fun. I got like 100 hours in the game. It was super duper fun. I got all the things. It was super enjoyable. And then I got 100 hours in. I beat everything. I got the motorcycle. I had all the weapons and everything. And then I just drove around the planes in Breath of the Wild aimlessly, really bored with nothing to do. It was just like, okay, this world that was suddenly so happy and full of life and and and ventureful to me is now boring. I have no purpose. And I kept driving around wanting to refine that purpose and refine that reason for playing the game. And I didn't. But I still drove around and did aimless [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for like an hour or two hoping it would come back. And eventually I was just like, "Well, it's all gone now." And so there's no purpose to this game. There's no purpose to anything I could do in this game. And then I turned it off. This is the experience you're going to have with making money and business. Because the reason why people make money is they think they're going to s find some fulfillment. And it's just like the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Zelda game. It's so much fun. You're getting excited from all these numbers and suddenly at one point you're making enough money that you no longer get excited about the money that you're making. So, for example, when I had my first $1,000 day way back when or my first $50,000 a month, it was euphoria. Now, I don't even feel anything if I make under $50,000 a day. In fact, if I don't make a couple million in a week, I don't really like even it doesn't even register with me. Now, that might sound spoiled and greedy and all sorts of stuff like that, but you're going to understand it here in a second. It's just because what happens, just like in a video game, is once you achieve certain goals, they no longer are going to give you huge euphoric boost. more so if your goal and the reason for making money is simply making the money. Once you make the money, guess what? It's going to be just like that Zelda analogy I gave you. Okay? It's going to be just like that. You're going to have so much fun going towards this goal, which is at one point the money, and then you're going to get to the point where you have the money, and you're going to be like, "Well, I guess the next goal is to make more money." And then you'll go make more money. And then it's like, "Okay, well then the next goal is to make more money." And eventually you're going to get to the point where you're like, "What's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] point of all this? I can buy everything I want." and then suddenly you're driving around the planes on your little motorcycle in Zelda wondering why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're even doing this and you're just considering like turning off the game. I'm not saying commit suicide or something like that. I'm just saying you're going to be super bored and that really fun sense of fulfillment that you had the entire way through is going to be gone and now this is the thing that's actually making you happy, not the actual goal. Getting the motorcycle and the master sword in Zelda is not where the happiness comes from. It's pursuing getting those things. Also, in this video we're talking a lot about what happens when you make the money. But if you want to actually get into the making of the money parts, I have a sweet mastermind. I want I'm just kidding. I don't have anything to sell you. What I will give you is all the courses and everything I used to make. It's about $20,000 worth of courses. I no longer sell them because it's way more profitable for me to just build businesses and tech companies. But I will give them to you for free if you subscribe and then once a month in my community tab. I post a link to all the courses where you can get them for free. You have to be subscribed or you won't see this community post. It's as simple as that. Subscribe, watch this channel, you'll see the community post. Go pick up all the courses. It's that easy. But you have to be subscribed. So, do that right now. Also, leave a like because why not? The first thing you need to do when it comes to making money is yes, make your goal, paying your rent, and getting your life needs covered, paying for your family, all that stuff, being able to live without stress. But secondly, you need to understand that all your happiness is going to come from playing the game. So, you might as well focus on playing the game. You'll notice that people that actually don't make much money from their businesses, but they're growing their business a lot. For example, you've probably seen a lot of tech founders, they take no profits from their company or they live pretty frugally or they pay themselves very little. For example, like I have a friend whose company's worth a billion dollars, but he pays himself a million, $2 million per year. He could easily cash flow the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and pay himself like $50 million per year if he wanted to. And yes, he makes all of his money from his stock. But the reason why he's having so much fun he's fulfilled is because he likes building the bigger thing. He's enjoying playing the game. If you're playing the game for money, eventually you're going to get the money and then you're not going to enjoy the game. So, understand that first. The Zelda analogy is everything. This is why people can play online multiplayer games because it's an infinite game. So, seek businesses that you once you have enough money, seek businesses you really enjoy working on, the path you enjoy and create infinite games out of the business that you can play forever and you enjoy playing because of ultimately the business is just a game there to entertain you. you're going to get to the point where the financial needs are covered and making more and more money is not really going to trigger some sense of fulfillment and you're going to be stuck playing games that you don't actually like to play or reach a goal that you don't really enjoy or get any long-term value from just like those goals in Zelda that I mentioned. Now, tying into this, this is 1.5 before I move to the next one. You're going to start pursuing replacement highs. And this is where a lot of danger comes from with young men. What they do is because they don't obsess over the game, they don't get fulfillment from the game itself. They get fulfillment from the money or that's where they think they're supposed to be getting fulfillment from. When they stop getting fulfillment for the money, they start trying to use the money to gain fulfillment. So, this is why you see people buying cars and fancy things because they think they're going to get some type of fulfillment from these objects. They start partying. They start trying to increase their social value. all these things because they're no longer getting enjoyment from playing Zelda. So, it's be like imagine you were stuck in Zelda. You got all the things and then suddenly you had like nothing to do in the game. So, suddenly you start like killing all the towns in the game and lighting stuff on fire and like making Link jump off buildings and doing all sorts of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to like try and get some new life out of the game. This is the same thing other people are doing. And so one thing you need to look for once you make some money is when you start getting bored and you start trying to replace the game that you were enjoying so much with dopamine driven highs. Now look, I have a nice car mostly to get attention on this YouTube channel. But don't get me wrong, I enjoy spending money. I enjoy nice things. I enjoy living in a big house and so on and so forth. I deeply understand at this point in my life that none of this is going to make me happy. I've lived at one point when I was building my business, still making good money in a empty apartment with just a bed, a desk, and a computer. And I was very happy. So, I ultimately know that nothing that I buy or do is going to bring me any type of success or joy. And it's okay to do nice things and have nice things as long as you understand that. It's all pointless. Like, you're not going to get the car and be good. It's just not how it works. It's not like I buy a Lamborghini and suddenly life seems happier and brighter. No, it's going to be the opposite if you're trying to find it in those things because you just can't. It's not that there isn't like some moral soap box you have to get on or it's like about fulfilling your soul or anything like that. It's just you can't get long-term happiness or any type of happiness from objects or houses or things. You you just simply can't. It's not there. And so if you try to, you're going to be again like it's like you go and pursue getting another master sword in Zelda. You're going to end up in the same spot you were before. Now, the things that start to get really nasty about this too is if you're not playing the game for a joy, you start having this defensible thing tied to your ego, which is your money. And then you start adding objects to it as well, which gives you again something even worse than you were before, which is fear of loss. See, when you were broke, you didn't have fear of loss. But now, as you do, oh, you're kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Which is why when I talk about living in a one-bedroom apartment with just a bed and a studio is good cuz you realize that you don't need any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] whatsoever. Like, as long as you can play the game, you're going to be happy. Some of my happiest times are just sitting in an empty empty apartment with just a desk coding video games that didn't make me any money. So, I ultimately know that if even if I lost everything, like it doesn't really matter. And this makes it so you can actually play the game and enjoy it a lot more cuz you're no longer afraid of losing the game. And look, I'm not saying you need to go out there and take massive risks that could ruin your life or uh be gambling with your life savings every single day cuz you no longer care about loss. I'm just saying that when you stop operating from a point of fear, you're going to like pursue greater feats in your business and try to play the game in a more enjoyable way because the point is really just the game. So, for example, when I was building Hyros, which is a business I have that's valued at hundreds of millions of dollars right now, or any of my other tech companies, when I built it from that apartment, it's not that the apartment or doing this is the key to anything. But I just realized that like, hey, all the happiness comes from building this thing. So, let's just like double down and not really invest in my lifestyle and just go and focus on this thing. And now, even to this day, like I don't need to invest in my lifestyle and I don't really care if I lose the lifestyle. And also my lifestyle is kept extremely low because I'm not pursuing adding to it as some important thing in my life. It might seem like I have a lot right now, but I'd really spend about 10% of what I make and investing in the business and playing the game is easily always the priority. That said, coming back to the main point right here, you end up with this huge fear of loss and this little devil that's going to make you sad and make you feel very unimportant whenever your money-making goes down or anything like that. This is a little nasty bugger that if you aren't aware of it is going to drive you to do insane things and become very money clingy which is going to end up destroying your business and making it worse. For example, in my first businesses when I got to $100,000 a month, my main goal in life was to never go back to $20,000 per month. And therefore, I did everything I could to cash flow and maximize those businesses versus grow them because I was afraid of going backwards. You also end up then killing your business because if you're complacent or you try to stay in the same place in business, you end up slowly going backwards always. This is the second thing that really messes you up. The solution to it again is just understanding you're not going to get happiness from the money or any of the things. So, you don't really have to be afraid of losing them. Just just do things and don't ever put yourself in the position where you're going to end up stressed out due the money. A lot of guys make this mistake and it ends up really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with their head and and locking them down for years. Now, number three is a nasty one, which is complacency. See, if you're not playing the game to play the game, as soon as you make enough money from the game, you're going to not want to play the game, and you're going to get complacent. And so, suddenly, that really remarkable person that you knew that was working all the time and ambitious and reading books and trying to do things, you just stop doing all of it because you're not playing the game for joy anymore. And what results is a person, you're going to see all these bad habits pop up. You get back in the video games, partying, drinking, uh just wasting your time away. You're going to get complacent, especially in your business. You're also going to get to the point where you start ignoring your business because you're not playing the business for fun anymore. You have the money from the business. And so you're going on vacations, you're going and chasing chicks or doing whatever you're doing. This is complacency. And so what it ultimately ends up doing is killing you because all the things that made you great, you put aside because you're not getting joy from the business. And the reason why you did all those great things was the joy you were getting from the business or building the businesses in the first place. So what you need to look out for is complacency. So for example, right now I'm making more money than ever. Our business is growing faster than ever. It's it's it's wild how much money is coming in right now. I'm pissed off because I want the business to be much higher. I want to be an all-time great SAS entrepreneur. I don't really care about like I don't there's nothing left for me to buy. But it could be very easy for me to come complacent right now and just travel around and and be drinking going on vacation and buying scrabbiest blabbish things and not working on the business and it would eventually kill the business because SAS especially the level I am at is very very competitive and someone else wants that cookie. In the past I get very complacent with businesses because I was doing it for money and then I had the money and then I would just like find ways to keep the business still going while just focusing on making the money. It's no way to live. it's going to kill your business and kill the thing that's making money in the first place and it's not going to bring any happiness. So, just recognize this right here and you have to get to the point where you're playing the game for fun and not playing the game purely for money or you're going to get complacent right now because my identity isn't really attached to the money I make or anything like that. I'm playing the game because I want to be an all-time great at it. That's literally the point. And so, I'm not complacent because I look at the business and say, "Does this make me an all-time great?" No, absolutely does not. I'm absolutely a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nobody when it comes to SAS and tech. having a business making mid to high eight figures a year isn't really that impressive when you see all these little AI companies popping up making hund00 million a year in their first year scaling to billion dollar valuations. I that I I want to do much better than I currently am and I do it for joy and fun and playing the game. You have to get at that point right there or you're going to get complacent. You're going to kill everything that made you great in the first place and brought you joy and kill the thing that's paying for all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's paying for your life. So, it's just a triple whammy right here and this messes up a lot of dudes. The fourth that really gets dudes is the problems it brings into your life. A lot of people say fake friends and fake women and and debt and it's all actually true. So look, it's not like the entire world wants to vampire off you as soon as you get rich. It's the fact that you almost want to vampire off the rest of the world because you're really bored. Okay? And what's going to happen is you're going to probably pursue a lot of things that you were lacking before. For example, when you get rich, you're probably going to want women. You're probably going to want social status. You're probably going to want these things right here. And the problem is you can definitely go and actually achieve these things if you do it from a place of identity security. Okay? So, if like if you like girls, great. But you're not going to go and get tricked into stuff by bad women if you're not desperate for women. If you want friends and social status, great. You go out there and work and you build a really healthy social status circle where you're actually doing it from a point of enjoyment of the people and not desperation to be liked. And it's a very very subtle coin flip. There's there's very little there's this blurry line between wanting to be liked because you're desperate to be liked and wanting to go out there and just build social status and truly enjoy people. It's very difficult to address when you first get into it. And so what you see most guys do is they end up with bad women. Women will [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ruin you faster than anything else. They end up with bad friends or even worse people that want to take advantage of you. I can't tell you how many times if you make millions and millions of dollars, you start going out with people. There's a lot of people that will film you when you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up or something like that. I've seen so many rich dudes I know, they get in with bad women who get some leverage on them. They get in with bad friends who get some leverage on them. They rack up a ton of debt and a lifestyle and a social status is all based around spending money. And then suddenly they end up complacent. They have all these people trying to take advantage of them and they have all this debt and crazy stuff weighing them down. And then suddenly they don't even have the choice to play the game out of love anymore. They have to make money from this business. They end up doing all sorts of weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm sure you've seen lots of influencers and koss who got in all sorts of financial trouble they didn't have to because they built this huge lifestyle of being famous and and living this luxury lifestyle and they have all these fake friends and all these fake women and all this fake stuff around them and then suddenly they have to like do and do all sorts of weird stuff to sustain it because they're going to go in debt and lose all it and then they're operating from a place of fear number two. So what you need to understand is when you make some money it's not that you have to go and be some humble [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You just have to really get your head straight and make friends for the right reasons and pursue women for the right reasons and actually just the really comes down to holding value in yourself and believing you're a valuable person period. And then you're not going to go out of your way and open yourself up to stupid people. And you can need to take two seconds to look at people around you and think about why they're really there and what their goals are and what could be the worst case scenario with these people. You need to be a little bit wiser about that. And then you need to keep your lifestyle super duper low compared to how much you make so that you never end up in trouble in the first place and you end up stuck in this big bubble bath of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It's not that you have to go around the world being skeptical and fearful, but you need to think that you have something that people want and if they're bad people, they're going to find ways to find leverage on you and stuff like that. I luckily have not had these problems, but I have so many friends and stuff like that who have had this. And the real solution to all these things is really just getting yourself straight because then you're not going to go and put yourself in stupid positions with stupid people because you don't need the people in the first place. So look out for this. Now number five, the final bad one. The final bad thing that's really kind of inevitable is you're probably going to lose friends when you get rich. One, because you're going to work more than everybody else. Two, because your priorities are going to be different. Okay? Some people they they get out of college, they want to get married and have kids, and then they want to hang out with their kids. That's fine. I'm not here to tell anybody what type of life they should have. There's no such thing as a good or a bad lived life. We all just die and none of it matters and we forget everything we ever knew. So, it's all just kind of irrelevant. You can define whatever you want your life to be. That's not what this video is about. The thing is that 90% of the people that you know in your 20s are going to have different priorities than you. Even if you guys do stay in touch, you're going to have a different life than they do. So, for example, I'm just going to be straight. There's a lot of things I like to do with my wife and go travel. A lot of my friends growing up, they just can't come do these things. going and traveling or going places or or doing a lot of the experiences I want to do. It's just not approachable for normal people. And so if I want to go and take vacations with a lot of people I knew growing up, I usually have to cover a lot of it, which is fine in some instances. But a lot of times, a lot of people are not as lucky as I am to have some of those deeper connections and whatnot. But at the same time, you have to realize you're going to have to work extra hard to stay in contact with people you grew up with because they just have different priorities. They're not going to be able to do the same things as you. They're not going to want to work as much as you. They're not going to really understand the things and why you're doing because it's not their priority. They're not going to want to talk about these things with you. And when you want to go and do things that cost a little bit of money and stuff like that, people are not going to be there to do it for you unless you pay for all of it. You put all these things together, you're probably going to need to start looking for friends that have the same interest and want to live the same type of life that you do. I'm not saying anyone's better or worse, but there's you want to do certain things, you're probably going to want to do it with people that share the same values in you and are able to keep up with you. That's usually going to result in you losing a lot of friends and having to actively go out there like a weirdo and pursue making friends with people. You're gonna have to actually find dudes on the internet who are into the same things you are and living the type of same life that you are and you say, "Hey, do you want to be friends?" And you have to put effort into making friends with people or it's just not really going to work out. Or you're just going to be super duper lonely because that's just the case of all these things I talked about right here. You're not going to get along and you're not going to be able to completely relate and do stuff with people that want to work a 9 to-ive job and just raise their kids and hang out at home and watch sports. That's just not some. You're not going to be able to be friends with these people or you will be able to maintain friendships if you really try at it. But again, you're going to be very lonely because this is not you. So, you're going to have to find new people that are more like you. And that's just what it is. And it kind of sucks losing friends and changing that or like not being able to invest in the same relationships, but that's just what it is. You can either be lonely as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and chasing a bunch of people that you don't relate to and cannot keep up with you in life or you can go and actually find people that relate to you and can do the things you want and you're not constantly having to bring yourself down. And I'm not saying bring yourself down in a value way. I'm not saying that anybody that has any type of lifestyle is more valued than other. But you're going to have to bring yourself to another level that you're not at to relate to other people at their levels. You need to just find people that are at your level or where you want to be at in life. And so that my little friend, my little padawan, are the things you need to look out for. There's other things that are going to happen, but if you nail those five things right here and you're prepared for them, it's going to save you all sorts of turmoil. You're not going to end up in that weird Zelda situation I talked about in your life. You're not going to end up in tons of weird situations due to your fear and lack of identity and people you bring yourself around. You're not going to be looking and wondering why you're lonely because you can understand, hey, you know, maybe I need to go find people. If if you're a professional black belt in jiu-jitsu and that's everything you do all day, you probably are not going to relate to people that don't do any form of self-defense and don't work out and exercise. Okay? Same thing right there. Same thing with business. Okay? So, if you do these things right here and you understand that, you're going to be fulfilled the entire way through because you're playing life for joy. You're playing business for joy, which is ultimately the point you want to get to. And it's not hard to get to that. You get to 50,000 a month, you're financially freeish. You can play the game for fun and you're not going to end up getting complacent. You're not going to end up operating out of fear. You're not going to end up putting yourself in all sorts of chaotic traps that most people put themselves in and you're not going to be lonely all the time. And if you are just a super introvert like me, you're not going to give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because you understand why. So that's it, gentlemen. That's the video. Don't do these five things. It will save your life. Now, that also being said, if you're interested in the actual making money part, I give away all my old courses, like $20,000 worth of courses. I don't sell these anymore because it's not profitable enough. It's better for me to make tech companies, but I'll give you the courses if you subscribe to this channel. And then once a month in my community tab, I make a post giving away all my other courses, copywriting, sales, advertising, how I run my ads, how I build all my funnels, everything. I give these all away. But you have to be subscribed or you won't see that post once a month in the community tab. So, subscribe and I'll see you in the next

All right, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Why don't you have a six-pack? Why are you not rich? Why are you not dating hot babes? Why are you not crushing all your goals in life like an incest baby between Elon Musk, Richard Branson, and Frodo from Lord of the Rings? He's short, but he's got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] heart just like you. I'll tell you why. It's because you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] suck. Just kidding. You're you're fine. Probably. Maybe annoying the average person views this channel. Probably not. But [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. We're going to go anyways. Cuz lucky for you, I have all those things. And I found a system for my life that makes achieving them easy. Okay, jokes aside, I think I've insulted you and lowered your morale enough. This video is going to show you how to basically get anything you want in life because getting everything you want in life is as simple as playing the Sims. You have the same amount of hours every single day as the greatest men on earth. There is nothing stopping you from putting in the work hours and effort of Mr. Beast, Jeff Bezos, and Camala Harris. And look, if that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] can go and run for president, you can basically do anything at this point. Why can't you? It's because you don't understand how your brain works. And if you understand how your brain works and how to structure it in these three ways I'm going to show you in this video, they're going to align like the cassidian crystals on the Death Star and give you unlimited power. And even if you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you too will be touring the nation doing book tours, giving speeches, and half the country will be wanting to vote for you despite your deep, deep incest retardation. Long story short, if you're kind of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is still going to work for you because I am actually a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] as well. I barely passed high school, was broke out of the military. And my favorite hobby, my only hobby actually just was drinking, and I still managed to use this to convert myself into a person that not only has a crispy six-pack, but also a net worth passing multiple nine figures. And I also am married to a pretty lady who's nice to me. So, all around, this is going pretty well. And what I'm going to show you in this video allowed me to basically get whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I want out of life without any restrictions. And I guarantee if you just do this, it's going to take all the responsibility that you're trying to force out of your hands and just make all of this easy and streamlined. So, let's begin. So, let's all bring it down to one key point that we're going to fix in this video. Why haven't you gotten the things that you want to get out of your life? Here's the number one reason. You haven't been able to force yourself to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it. You haven't had the willpower. You haven't been able to make yourself do it. Look, if you woke up every single day and busted out 12 hours of extremely focused work, you didn't do anything. You weren't distracted. you just sat down, worked and worked and worked on whatever you were pursuing in life, you'd get pretty good results in it. Maybe you wouldn't be the Tom Brady of whatever you're doing, but you definitely make the NFL. You wouldn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] suck. Whether it's making money, getting a great physique, whatever your goals that you're trying to achieve are, being the best at something, you'd be able to do it if you were able to just sit down and make yourself [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] focus on it like you're playing the Sims. Have you ever played the Sims? You ever remember making the Sims go and read books for 12 hours straight, just pounding espressos, sleeping like a machine, going to work in a perfect mode, repeat. They have no friends, no family except when you need to score friend points in the game. If you ran your life like that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like you tell that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to, you'd be doing great, but you're not. So, the secret we really have to realize is how do we get ourselves to perform like a sim, aka where we just do all the things we need to do constantly like a machine? And more so, how do we make it easy? How do we make it so we don't want to kill ourselves while we're doing this? This is how you do it. So, what I'm about to show you actually just has three steps. And if you optimize these three things again, you will line up like the Death Star laser and unlock unlimited power in yourself or at least enough power to not be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anymore. And I'm going to give these three things to you here in a second and they will just plain work. It makes everything very streamlined. But you have to understand the crux of your problem right now, which is that thing, that blob of mass in your head, your brain. And your problem right now is not be able to get this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to do what you want. You want to do a lot of things. Like I'm sure you want to work out five times a day, make tons of money to read 50 books a year, and go and learn I don't know the Kama Sutra. What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] am I saying? Anyways, you can't get this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to do what you want consistently. And even if you try and do it, the spurts of doing it are so so hard that you eventually run out of willpower and then you just stop. And so you can't run your life like a Sim at this point. So, you have to understand how to trick this little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in doing what you want and actually make it enjoy it. Because you are two different things. There's your brain, which is this organ that thinks and does things. It really isn't you. Have you ever listened to the thoughts that go on in your head and the things you think about, they just pop out of nowhere? That's your brain. It's just doing stuff all the time. And it's always making you do stuff you don't want to do and pushing and do stuff you want don't want want don't want don't want don't want don't want don't want to do because it's not you. It has nothing to do with you. It's an organ that influences or releases chemicals that then make you want to do certain things. But really, you have this separate willpower, this consciousness in your head that clearly doesn't always want to do these things. You don't want to eat cake. You don't want to drink alcohol. You don't want to play video games 24 hours a day. You'd love if you were motivated to do great things and read and have all these great personality traits, but you just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] don't because this thing keeps pressing you and it makes it very hard to have those things regardless. So, the great question is, why don't you have and do all these things you don't want to do? Here's exactly why. So, your brain is like this creature that needs to get something. All right? So, for example, if you go in the Sims and you tell it to go entertain itself, let's say this is the entertainment button right here in the Sims. What the Sim is going to do, and let's just refer to the Sim as your brain going forward. It's going to find the most straightforward way to get here. So, let's break this down. So, let's imagine your brain is essentially the Sim in the video game. It it has needs. Okay? So you you are the Sim and you have needs and you have to understand that your brain doesn't live in the future. It also doesn't live in terms of fulfillment. It doesn't equate itself to making lots of money and being happy. It doesn't equate itself to working towards a long-term goal and being happy. It simply lives right now in this moment. It's a dumb lizard brain and it has needs it's going to need to fulfill right now. And what you have to understand about the brain is it's an optimization machine. Its goal is to get from point A to point B with as least energy and effort as possible. So just like a Sim in a video game, if you tell it to entertain itself, what it's going to do, it's going to do a quick scan of the area and what's available and it's going to find the shortest way to fulfill this need. And once the need is fulfilled, the motivation and everything to do anything else is pretty much gone. The motivation is not not there anymore because the need has been fulfilled. And it doesn't care if the way it gets to this need is unhealthy or something that doesn't work in your favor. It doesn't even care if the need itself damages you in the long run because it doesn't live in tomorrow. It doesn't live in next week. It doesn't live in next year. And it doesn't even satisfy its current needs by you going and achieving your life goals. If you go make a lot of money if you become very successful, your brain is still going to be like, "Hey man, maybe you want to go like watch some porn or something. That sounds great." Or like, "Hey, dude, that World of Warcraft account, that sounds really satisfying." It's still going to get really high from doing heroin. And it's like, hm, maybe we should just like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all this work stuff and go do heroin. That's how your brain works because it thinks how to fulfill its need as fast as possible. It doesn't care about what actually makes your life better or worse. It doesn't care if the needs and that you're fulfilling put you in debt and ruin your life. That's why people go and start gambling and whatever, lose all their money, and you're like, "Why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] did I do this?" Because your brain was like, "Hey, the fastest way to get dopamine, the fastest way I can get this hit is just to go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to the casino and lose my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money." Because it doesn't think in terms of results. It just thinks in terms of getting this chemical release and once it does it stops wanting to do it and then you're just going to mope around. So you have this situation right here that becomes very toxic if you do not control your brain in today's world. So what you need to understand is that in the past caveman times there was basically only like three ways to get dopamine. You had to like eat, you had to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or you had to like hang out with friends or something. I don't know. And you had to be valuable to the tribe. That was like it. You didn't have a phone, you didn't have a TV. That was it. So really, the only way a caveman had to reach any level of fulfillment or scratch the itch and the chemicals the brain needs to have be released was to hunt, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] go hang out with friends and be valuable to the community. That was it. So I would be willing to bet that cavemen were pretty productive [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And if you look at people from the 50s, 20s, and before we had a lot of technology, they got a lot of stuff done. They were really active. There weren't a lot of people just sitting around watching TV and like doing nothing and just drained all the time. Why was that? because the brain had no way to get access to dopamine. It had no way to actually get any of the things it wanted because there was no shortcuts to it. Now, when you are working with your brain in general, what you need to understand about this, and this ties in, we're going to lay it all here in a second. I know I've talked about this before, but there's other stuff they're going to tie in this to make this very fast and easy, is the brain is going to find the fastest way to get there. It doesn't care if it's negative or has a con on your life. For example, if you're looking at going and talking to women, you're not going to be motivated to talk to women if you're watching pornography. Cuz why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] would you leave the house and go put yourself in some existental insist put yourself at risk of chance of being denied by a lady in public when you could just load up Pornhub? Why why would you why would you go do that? You wouldn't. This is why a lot of guys don't date anymore because they just do that. Why would you go and build a business and get this fulfillment and take on challenges when you can just boot up a video game? And so your brain is going to go and say, "hm, okay, look, I don't care about the business you want to build being successful. I don't care about you being physically fit. I care about getting this need fulfilled in a shortest way possible and spending as little energy as possible getting there." And so it's going to reroute and optimize around these things. And you're not wanting you're not going to want to do anything challenging. So now that you understand that, you also have to understand a few other things about your brain. One, your brain is limited. There is only so many things it can focus on at once. So if you put 100% of your focus into say building a business, you're going to get really huge returns from that focus because you're going to see all the edge cases and all the focus that goes into it is going to go into something that makes your life go up. But the more your focus gets split, the less impact it's going to have because you're putting less focus into things. The next thing you understand is that your brain can function better or worse. So, for example, if you're drinking all the time, if you're completely frying your dopamine and like to the point where your brain's exhausted and mentally overwhelmed. I'm sure if you've ever played a 12-h hour video game bench, you see how your brain feels after you can't focus or look at anything. If you're not sleeping well, if you're not eating well, if you are not dealing with inflammation in your body and how your body resets every single day, you're also going to be slow. So, what am I trying to point out here? If we take all the three things I just talked about right here, and we lay it in a train track of success, okay, we have our energy, basically how well our brain works, we have our focus, and then we have our motivation, which is basically our dopamine, which is really the hardest one to control out of all of them. If we can optimize all three of these things in order, we're going to get really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good at things really fast. So, for example, let's imagine that this is again like the Sims, and we need to fill up all these bars. If you max out your energy bar, you max out your focus bar, and you put all of your motivation and points into whatever job career you're getting into, you max out all of these right here, your life output is going to be outrageous. Let me make sure I got that fully in view. It's going to be outrageous. Cuz let's imagine this. Let's look at a bad scenario. This is most people. Let's say you're putting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in your body. You're not sleeping well, and you're doing all sorts of things. They're frying your brain. Your energy is at 20%. Now, let's look at most people's lives. Their focus is fractured in a zillion different ways. They have bills and life responsibility that's driving them nuts. They have family. They have friends. They have 15 different hobbies that they're looking at and they're not good at. They are looking at politics and and on Twitter all the time. They're on their life is just so much. There's so many things going on in their life. They have all their chores daily. Everything that's going on in their life. Think of anything that you focus on that isn't based around success in your daily time. Go and document the next hour after this video. Sit down and think about how much you focus on things that have nothing to do with the growth or success of your life. Do it. You'll be like, "What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on in this monster thing that I call my brain? I am [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] retarded." You really have to really think about it and document this. And then finally, imagine most people's motivation is completely won out because they're looking at porn. They're watching TV all the time. They're playing video games and they have 15 other different hobbies whether it's their phone or some form of technology that's giving them all the rewards, all the incentives immediately without any effort. So what is the normal person doing right here? You have this slow person that is only putting like 5% of their focus in life growth that has zero motivation to do so. Like they have no interest in it either. Like if they go read a book on self-help or they go and go to the gym for 30 minutes, they're in mass amounts of pain. Why? Because their brain's like, "What are you doing, dude? We filled the motivation quota an hour. Why are you at the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gym? We just ran a really sweet dungeon in world. You don't need to do this. What are you do? Go home and go home and take a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and sleep. Stop it, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] We can deal with this tomorrow." And then they repeat the same exact process. How are you supposed to be successful when you when you are operating like this? You can't. It's like driving a car that's has half of engine and you've crammed your own feces into the gas tank and you've completely painted the windshield with with hentai waifu pictures. You can't see where you're going and you everything smells like ass and it's not working very well. You can't do this. This is dumb. So, how do we go and fix this? Well, we sit down and we make a concerted effort to document our lives and fix all these things. So, the first place you need to start at is going to be your energy because you can't deal with these things if you're not if you don't have no energy. So, here's the most basic [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you can do right here. Now, there's a ton of things you can do to improve your energy and biohack and all that stuff. That's not going to get you the results. Here's what's going to get you the results when it comes to energy. Okay? I'm not going to go into all my biohacking. I could go talk about hyperbaric chambers and red light therapy and injecting yourself with peptides. We're not doing that yet. Just chill out. Remove sugar and inflammatory foods from your diet. This is where almost all the brain fog is coming from. Just eat plants meat and simple carbs like sweet potatoes. Just go to the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] store, get yourself some chicken breast, some sweet potatoes, some berries, and some nuts and just eat that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Your brain fog and everything won't go away or jump on the carnivore diet. Just take whatever you're doing and focus on lowering the inflammation in your body as much as you possibly can. Research that. If you do that, you're going to have clear thoughts. Then go to bed on time. Just just go to bed and try to get 6 to8 hours of sleep. Then stop poisoning yourself. All right? Stop smoking pot. Stop drinking consistently. You're not rich yet. You don't get to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up on the weekends. All right? No. No. When when you when you have millions of dollars, you can go and enjoy your Irish car bombs and and butt plug your marijuana candies you need to take to go to bed every single night. Not yet. All right. If you stop doing all these things right here, your energy is going to get up to 80%. Which is good enough. All right. That's good enough. You don't need to be at 100%. We don't need to be in Hyperberg Chambers, Brian Johnson in this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yet. Now, your focus. This is so important if you want to be successful in anything, particularly in business, because business takes a really long time and it's hard. Get rid of anything in your life distracting you. Just that's it. Until you've achieved your goals in life, but until you've set yourself up moneywise, no, you don't don't you don't need friends. You don't need hobbies. You don't need to be involved in politics. If you know what's going on in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] politics, and I know on Twitter, I've said some some pretty spicy political takes. Don't follow what I do. I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You need to be better than me. You You need to have all this stuff out of your head. If you're walking around, document your head the next hour. What are you thinking about? If it's in your life and it's not making your life actively better, get rid of it. This means lowering your life cost in terms of how you live in your lifestyle down to zero. Most people's biggest stress is money. Like 50% of their time is focused on making money. Now, I don't mean making money for the sake of growth. So, when I wake up to make money, I want to grow my net worth from 100 million to 500 million. That's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to grow. Most people are making money like they're worried about paying a bill on time, how they're going to make rent, how they're going to get something useless object or something. I'm doing this to rack up a high score. A lot of people are focused on it to survive. So, what you do is you lower your threshold of survival down to zero. That means getting a studio apartment in Wyoming next to a grocery store where you don't need a car and you can get some weights and you can just sit in your room and lift weights and work until you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich. When you're rich, then go do stuff. All right? It doesn't take that long if you just focus like that because all of your focus points are going into getting rich, which is what most of you guys here to do. This same thing I'm talking about right here applies to anything else you're doing. You want to be good at a sport. You want to get jacked. You want to get better with women. You want to do any of the things that males want to do but don't do. It's right there. All right. So, this is what you need to do. Reduce your life down to zero. Get rid of anything that you focus on in the next couple hours that doesn't add to your life that isn't absolutely mandatory. You don't need friends. You don't need to be hanging out with your family. If you have kids and you're young, congrats. You kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up a little bit. But you don't need to be also be spending 15 hours a day with your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] kids. Like, find ways to reduce and get lots of focus time in your day and remove all the complexities from your life. Become a simple little caveman. Okay? You can have all these interests and stuff when you're rich and you've solved all of your problems and you're luring over everybody else. Now, finally, motivation. You have to get that your brain is not going to be unhappy from boredom. The reason why you become unhappy when you remove video games, TV, and all these little addictive habits you have in your life, the reason why you're unhappy is cuz your brain is like, "Hey, we had this really quick route to get dopamine and pleasure, and now you're like making us not do that, and now we can't get this chemical." It's kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up, bro. So, I'm just going to twist this knife in you for a few days. But what happens is your base happiness level, for example, if you look at people that end up paraplegic. Now, don't ever run this test. I'm not going to test this theory out, but what I've heard through the podcast where people talk a lot about complex things is that when people end up paralyzed, their life happiness after the first year ends up balanced out and they're just as happy as before they were paralyzed. What I'm trying to explain to you right now is that your base happiness is just going to phase out to wherever you are. Like, it doesn't actually matter what you're doing in life. There's people in jail that are just as happy as billionaires because your body kind of equates to where you're going to be. So, you're much better off just learning how to be happy where you are first off. That's a different video. What I'm telling you right now is that you need to push yourself to be extremely bored and it's going to kind of suck at first, but then you're just going to balance out and then the things you used to find that were really painful to do like going to the gym or working become the most exciting thing you have. So, I'm going to give you one other example. When you were a kid, probably growing up and maybe actually this might I might have been the last kid that had this experience grow up. I could usually sit down and read a book or hang out and talk with people without drinking. And I could just go in the backyard and like fight bugs with sticks and it was really exciting. Like and if you look at a lot of kids when they were growing up in the 50s or whatever when they didn't have TV or a lot of things, they were a lot more active and they were doing a lot more productive things with your life. People didn't just sit around and do nothing the entire time. They're really productive uh members of society. And why was this? It's because doing all these productive things wasn't painful for them. and they found it really engaging and fun. And so these people were not these people honestly were happier than we are now. So there's no secret to happiness in what you're currently doing. It's all nonsense. Then this amount of overload you're giving yourself is actually making you much unhappier in the long run. Uh so the thing I'm going to tell you right now is that again seek the boredom because eventually the boredom will be happiness and then you're going to wake up. So for example, today it's it's 3:00 a.m. right now. I'm pumped to make this video. You can tell I'm actually having a pretty good time making this. I'm putting a lot of effort into work right now making this content for you and I'm happy and I'm thrilled. Why? It's because last week I had a very big temptations to play Borderlands 4. I wanted to go play this video game. Load it up. It looked really cool. I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do that. Why? Because if I had done that, I would not be enjoying making this video right now. I'd be itching to play Borderlands 4. If I load up World of Warcraft and start playing that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] again, I start going and partying too much. I start going and have my phone and I have access to Twitter. I don't carry a phone in myself literally for this reason. I'm going to start wanting to do those things and I'm going to find making content for you very boring and painful. I don't want that because making content for you and doing this stuff in the morning and being excited about doing it makes me really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich and I like being rich and I like looking back on on a week or my life and be like, "Wow, that was cool. I like hit my goals and I fulfilled the things I want to do instead of reaching level 99 in World of Warcraft. Instead of having another useless gaming experience, instead of having another mediocre drinking experience, instead of watching a TV show and having the same experience I've had a billion times, I want to keep growing up in life. And I want that to be fun, not painful. So, to wrap this all up right here, if we align our energy, we're going to have energy to deal with all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] If your energy is out of whack, you're just not going to get that. If we isolate our focus to only the things that going to make our lives better, only those things are going to improve, and they're going to improve at maximum rate. And then if we make sure to keep ourselves bored enough, and by bored I don't mean you're going to be sitting around in pain. I mean lowering your threshold for entertainment to where reading a book is entertaining again. You can get there. I don't know if you guys remember reading Harry Potter growing up and it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fantastic. Now you have to be watching a movie with six pairs of boobs in your face at all times. A soundtrack from Kesha while you're on your phone and not even watching at the same time thinking about how you're going to play that next World of Warcraft bout. You need to get back to the baseline, buddy. Okay, you're you're living a little bit too wild. And if you do these three things right here, inevitably you're going to be super motivated to put all your energy into that thing that makes your life better. And you're going to be super highly effective at it because all your focus is there. And then you're going to get really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good at I don't care if it's getting rich. I don't care if it's getting six-pack. I don't care if it's crushing cans with your butt cheeks. You're going to become excellent at it very fast. And this is how you own ass in life. So do it. Now, if you want actual tactics to make a lot of money, uh you should subscribe to this channel again because I release all my old courses, which used to be like 20,000 bucks worth of business building courses. They're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good. I give them all to my subscribers on here for free in the community tab once a month, but you have to be subscribed or you won't see it.

So, I'm just going to tell you all sorts of cool secrets. So, that's it. Uh, I'll see you next

TITLE: It SUCKS, but it makes 1 mil/year WITHOUT risk or money

================================================================================

Excuse me for being [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] blunt, but why don't you make more money? No, seriously. You're watching this video right now. It's about making money. Obviously, you want to become some form of rich. Why aren't you doing it? Why are you here? It's not really that hard of a question. Just go do it. It's because of risk. It's because of fear of failure. The reason why 90% of people do not go and pursue becoming more wealthy is because they think there's some failure or some risk to it where you have to roll the dice with your current life in order to get rich. This is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] unfathomably true. ruined in this video. I'm going to not only prove it to you, I'm going to show you how to get stupidly rich without taking any risk. I will actually break it down step by step for you and show you how I've applied what I'm going to show you in this video over and over and over again over 15 years to build a net worth of nearly multi- nine figures. If you can tell, I'm a little bit spicy in this video because this is the stupidest belief that people have. It couldn't be any farther from the truth. And people have been looking at me like I'm crazy for saying stuff like this and looking at me like I'm crazy since I started my first business out of the military 15 years ago. People thought I was absolute batshit [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because they hold this stupid belief which is dumb. So let me destroy it for you in this video and then at the end of this video I'll even give you all my old courses, all my old business building lessons. In fact, an entire blueprint to get from zero to 100k a year and in 100k a year to a million dollar a year all for free on this channel. But first, we got to address the main issue. Why the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] aren't you doing it? So let's talk about it right now. So, let's talk about why you're not trying actively aggressively like hell to get rich or maybe you're holding yourself back or I don't I don't know what the hell is going on in your life, but this is probably it. So, when people think about making money or escaping wherever they are in life, they think it's like playing a game of rush and let with three bullets in the chamber and you just have to go and play this nasty game of risk where you either ruin your life or you become incredibly successful. And most people don't want to do this. If I said, "Hey, you can take your entire bank account and 5x it right now if you just go put it on red or black in Vegas." Despite the odds being pretty much in your favor compared to the risk, the reward being super great, 5x reward being more than 2x math and stuff, you still probably wouldn't do that because people are risk averse. In the context, if that was the only bet you could ever make in your entire life, then yes, you shouldn't do that because there's one in five chance you ruin your entire life. And so when I first started my first business out of the military, I was flat broke. I had saved about $6,000 when I was in the military. And I took all that to put into giving myself the time and living expenses to go and build my first business. And frankly, everybody I knew thought I was an idiot. They thought I was insane. It was like I was going and sleeping with a pencil sharpener to get turn on at any moment. People are like, "What the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are you doing, Alex? You should be going to school. You should be going the lowrisk path." which don't even get me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] started on that because if you're going to college, that's the riskiest, most guaranteed failure path you can possibly go down, but we're not going to talk about that right now. That's a whole entire other video. Anyways, I started a business from here and I just did the same thing over and over and over again. And without risk, I was able to go and get from $0 a month to 10K a month to 50K a month to 100K a month to where I am now, which is millions a month. And I don't feel like I took much of a risk the entire way through. There's some things you can do that can make it risky. You can be really stupid about this and yes, you can mess up your life, but if you're just a little bit smart about it, if you think a little bit, if you learn how to hedge your bets, no, you you can't ruin your life trying to get wealthy. You can just almost guarantee it's going to happen if you just repeat what I'm going to show you right here. So, the first thing you need to understand is that the greatest risk you can take is not taking any risk. Once you understand this, then I will show you how to lower your risk of virtually zero and grow whatever business or heck just gain a skill set that will get you paid millions of dollars working for a business. I have many employees that work for me that are multi-millionaires just because they're good at their job. So, if you want to get rich, don't just assume you have to build a business. You can actually just go work for somebody and be really good at what you do, which I'll touch on in this video. But you have to understand if you go and do the traditional route that people follow right now, which is get out of high school, go to college, get a 100k in debt, what am I writing right here? Get 100k in debt, go on the the cause college, and then slowly work your way up a ladder of a job until you're making good money, which will happen when you're like 35 or something. I I don't know. The truth of this is if we look at this process, most people don't make good money. Like if you look at it, 90% of people are broke. 10% of people hold all the money. And if you really look at it, only about 1% of people are actually rich, which is to the point where you don't have to worry about money. You have a really nice house. Maybe you can fly private even now and then. I'm not saying that's the qualification of being rich, but it's the the point where you have so much money that you just don't care anymore. And so almost nobody reaches that point. And if you look at the standard life route that most people go on right here, it it's guaranteed failure. one, not making good money until you're 35. Like, trust me, from 20 to 35 is a massive chunk of your life. 15 years, your youth is from your 20s to your 60s. That's like onethird of your life just spent struggling. That that that's that's guaranteed failure right there, just taking the lowrisk path. On top of that, you have this debt. You have this stuff that holds you and then adds risk to your life. So, when people go and take the normal life, what they're going to do is they're going to get into debt. they're going to get an apartment or get into some type of lifestyle which isn't super wasteful, isn't extravagant or anything like that. But the problem is this lifestyle and this debt combined make it so that anything they do has massive risk. Because if you have some $2,000, $1,000 in college bills, you have that $2,000 $3,000 apartment, you have your car note, you have all these other things coming in, you can't afford to take risk. Even if you're making, let's say, 10K a month and your bills are 6K a month, which is where most people are give or take after taxes. they barely have anything left over. You can't take risk because any risk you take, if it goes wrong, you're stuck with these bills coming in right here and you're screwed. And so you end up locked into this very mediocre wishywashy life path that's grand promise is to take you to 60 where you can barely retire if then with how money is working right now. This doesn't work. Like the thing I'm trying to point out right here, if you want a good life where you're financially free, I'm not talking being turbo rich. I'm just saying being financially free. You're not going to get here doing this. So it's just basically delaying failure which is still going to be failure. This this doesn't work the end. And so the first thing you need to realize is the traditional life path that so many people are telling you to go down and that you're weighing as the other end of the bullets. Remember those six bullets I talked about. This is the the safe route to go. It's not the safe route. You're automatically going to fail here. So you might as well just wipe this off the table and not consider this an option. And here's why I think making money isn't very risky or going to try and become wealthy isn't very risky. Now, first thing, if you like this video, go below and subscribe. Why should you do that? Every month, once a month, in our community tab that only my subscribers can see, I post all my old courses. This is like $20,000 worth of old courses, teach everything on how I build businesses, how I run my ads, how I sell everything. I'm giving it all to you for free cuz I'm so rich. I don't sell courses anymore. I just don't want to do it. It's just not a fun business model. I like selling software. So, I'm just going to give it all to you for free, but you have to subscribe. And then you'll see on the community tab once a month. So, here's the point I'm trying to make right here. How do we do this without risk? So, whenever I run live streams, which I do about once a week, you should subscribe to attend those as well. Number one question is, how do I do this thing without messing up? How do I do it without risk? How do I do it if I don't have any money? The the question behind all this is, how do I do this while avoiding failure? And I'll show you how to do it while avoiding grand failure that ruins your life here in a second. But the first thing you got to understand is what is failure? And what failure is is so for example when you lose at something you're embarrassed or it makes your life much harder. Okay, that's really the only two things that people really define failure as. So something that makes you look bad, so makes you look stupid in front of all the babes or makes your life harder and more difficult. So really what we need to do is we need to one eliminate both of these. So one, why would it be embarrassing to fail? Well, that's because you're giving too much credit to other people. Now, everybody can tell you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what other people think. But let's look at the grand scheme of it. If you delay going and becoming wealthy for your entire life, for most of your life, people will already think you're a loser. They just don't think you're a big loser. Okay? So, it's better to even go out there and fail in a cataclysmic way. And people kind of think you're a loser than just by default thinking you're a loser for the rest of your life. And then when you go through enough failures and you get good at it and you become a winner, everybody thinks you're a winner. So the only way people are not going to think you're a loser is by eventually overcoming it anyways. So you're basically just setting for like being a three out of 10 on people's respect scale and settling for that so you can avoid temporarily being a one to eventually be an eight or a 10. It doesn't make any sense. On top of that, you could also just take the bigger route and just be an emotionally stable person, not give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what other people think because it's your life. You're the only one that's going to ever experience it. And shaming yourself for trying to become better and taking risks. Like for example, if you pick up a guitar and you're bad at guitar for the first year you're playing guitar, you're never going to become good at it if you let that stop you. If you let people think like, "Oh, he's he's trying to learn how to play guitar. What an idiot." If you let that stop you, you'll never be good at guitar. So, you'll never be good at anything. And you're letting a bunch of people shame you for trying to improve yourself. Stop being such a little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] godamn it. I can give you any type of mental highQ, but maybe just stop being a little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You're going to be somewhere 40 years old. Do you think all the people you went to high school with are going to be checking in on you when you're 40? Do you think you're going to give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what they thought about you when you were 20 years old? No. Just stop it. Okay. Thanks. Now, the next part of this is something that makes our life much harder. How do we avoid this? Well, a lot of people think when when they go and start a business, they start trying to get wealthy. They didn't have one go and make some big massive investment. That's just not true. The end. You can start small. You can start smaller businesses and you can scale them up. So, one that fear of failure right there, it doesn't exist. Next, the reason why people are really afraid and it makes their life harder is because they already have a lifestyle and everything to maintain. I'm going to give you just a little tip right here. If you want to go and let's say you're making 5,000 a month at your job or you're doing some freelance work or I don't know, something like that, maybe just get your lifestyle cost as close to zero as possible. Move to a little one studio apartment in Wyoming next to a grocery store. Don't have a car. Have a computer and just work from there. Oh, looks doesn't sound fun. You know what doesn't sound fun? taking the slight upgrade in having a car and living in a one-bedroom cramped apartment till you're 40 years old. That sounds like it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sucks, too. So, maybe just downgrade so your lifestyle is very low for a couple years until you're making good money and you're capable of making good money and then get the lifestyle. Don't don't try to get a mediocre lifestyle that you can barely fund and then continue that for the rest of your life. Have a absolute dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] lifestyle that cost you nothing. Maintain that until you can make good money and then slowly upgrade the lifestyle so your lifestyle costs 10% of what you make. So, for example, all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you see me do, everything in my life right now cost me about 10% of what I make passively from my investments and in for my businesses every single month. So, like I have no stress whatsoever. And I take all sorts of crazy risk. If you've seen me in crypto, I literally gamble with multiple eight figures at a time there because again, if I lose all that, that's fine. That's fine because again, I've kept my risk or my lifestyle very low. You need to do the same exact thing. Now, here's the thing you need to understand. Finally, that's in the big picture right here. People think that you're going to go and play this game of Russian roulette in business and if you shoot yourself in the head, let's say there's three bullets in a chamber, you shoot yourself in the head, it's just game over. You're done. I'm going to tell you the truth here. In business, when you're first getting started, it's like playing Russian roulette with six bullets in a chamber. But what happens when you shoot yourself in the head is nothing if you go and build your businesses the right way. For example, on this channel, linked at the end of this video, is a full guide on how to get to your first 100k, 200k year business. breaks down everything you should be looking at right there. And then all the tactics you need are also on this channel. And those are going to show you how to start businesses where even if you fail, your life's not over. You just literally refresh your page and try again. The truth is though that the chance of failure is extremely high when you're starting business because you don't know what you're doing. Like for example, if you're going and wrestling for the first time, you're going to go wrestle in high school or something, you're not going to win your first few matches against other wrestlers. You're probably not going to win any matches for your first year if you're competing against anybody that knows what they're doing. Duh. That's fine. It's okay with this. This is the same thing in business because when you're playing in business, the other people that are making money are kind of more like those experienced wrestlers. You're not going to beat them your first time, but you eventually will and it's fine. So, what you have to understand though is once you get good enough in business, yeah, you're going to fail most of the time, but when you succeed, the return is 10, 20, 500x. For example, I started with $6,000 out of the military and I've been working on businesses for years. I have hundreds of millions of dollars in my net worth right now. I don't even know what the return is from that. You're not going to get that anywhere else. And the truth is in business, the rewards versus the risk are lopsided. For example, it'd be like if you went to Vegas and there's a 50/50 bet. You got black, you got green. I don't know what this drawing means right here, but as you can tell right here, the bet is 50/50. But if you win, it's a 20x instead of a 2x like it is in Vegas. This bet right here, the easiest way to make sure you win always is just take this bet every day of the week. Now, in business, it's even more lopsided. It's probably like one in six. Pretty bad odds. But if you look at the return, which is 500x, the reward to the risk is incredible. So what you need to do is position yourself in your life that you can afford to take that risk over and over again. What your path in business is going to look like is, yeah, you're going to start off, you're not going to make much. You're not going to make much. You're not going to make much. And it's going to click and you're going to get stuck here again. You're going to take risk and it's going to bobble up and down. And then it clicks. This process repeats. And so all you need to do is allow yourself the room to take these risks right here by lowering your lifestyle down that you can repeatedly take the risk over and over and over again aggressively and do nothing else but try and take that risk. So what it really comes down to is positioning yourself so you can be a chronic risk taker because eventually the risks pay off way more than the rewards because one money compounds on itself. The more money you have the easier it becomes to make money. But on top of that, the better you get at making money, the more skilled you are, the better you are at controlling these risks. You understand how to put the business together. Look, when you're five years into this, building businesses from scratch or doing anything that's really high value is going to be easy for you because you've gotten good at it. For example, if you're going and playing quarterback and a football team, the first year you play, it's going to be very difficult to play quarterback. But when you're on year 15 and you're playing college football, you're going to be able to operate at a high level that's easy by default. Are you going to be Tom Brady? No. You're probably not going to be the next Elon Musk. You're probably not make you're not going to make billions of dollars. But can you go out there and consistently be a good college quarterback if you try long enough and hard enough at it? Yes. And especially if you just take the risk because that's going to allow you to build the skill and then the compounding bumps you're going to see right here are going to occur. And so the true secret I've been trying to tell you this entire video and why I say it's not without risk. Yes, it is without risk, but the default path that most people take is guaranteed failure. So you don't even have a chance to win there. It's like you go to Vegas and it's just automatic loss. You put your money down and the dealer punches you in a dick and then blows his nose on your face. That's not that's not a good bet. I don't know who is. Maybe you're into that kind of stuff. I know we got some weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that watch this channel. That's not what I'm looking for. And there's plenty of other channels on YouTube that will service that deep need you have. But if you're like a normal person who isn't like a grown man blowing his nose on his face and destroying your balls, the risk right here, the only way to avoid the risk of being poor and a loser for your entire life is to chronically take risk. And if you keep taking risks by the nature of how odds work, they will eventually click and one will win and it will pay you those huge rewards and you will get better. So you will win more often. So the inevitable way to avoid the risk of being poor forever, which is the thing we're trying to avoid here, is to take risk as consistently as possible and live a lifestyle that allows us to take risk. So when we go and we're first starting at starting our first businesses or learning skills or whatever, we are able to keep our lifestyle very low. So we can take that risk over and over again. Then we're going to bump up and maybe we're making 150k a year. We can bump up our lifestyle a little bit. You maybe get that big fancy one-bedroom apartment, maybe get a car, or you can be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] psychopath and just keep living in a trailer, which is kind of awesome. You should just do that in your 20s regardless. Then you bump up to making a million a year. Maybe you move out of the trailer. Maybe you remain a psychopath. Who cares? Then you get to $2 million a year. Maybe you finally move out of the trailer. Nah, unless you have a girlfriend, unless you get married, continue living in the trailer, continue smoking crystal meth and playing World of Warcraft on the weekends, that's the way to go. But you see what I'm structuring right here? If you structure your life correctly, there's really no risk to taking risk because you can take them over and over again. If you're playing Russian roulette and it's actual loaded bullets and one bullet gives you $10 million, the other five kill you. Yeah, that sucks. But the other five bullets in the gun don't do anything to you. They make they just make you lose a little bit of money that you get back. So, it's like being afraid of dying in a video game. If you're afraid of dying in a video game, you're just a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So, stop being a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Go take more risk. That's the video.

TITLE: Want to be rich but your lazy? Sell these. (while its legal)
VIDEO ID: 9fkH68UWSng

================================================================================

Do you think making lots of money is hard? Of course you do. You're a talentless [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] But lucky for you, I think making money is easy. And in this video, I'm going to show you what you need to be selling to make money easy because I don't want to intimidate you here. You need to know one thing about me. I too also am a talentless [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I'm quite lazy. And so when I sell something, when I start a business, I want it to be easy. I want people to say yes to everything that I am selling. Therefore, I only sell one of these three things about to show you in this video. If you sell one of these three things, making money becomes easy because everybody says yes. You don't even have to be there. People come and find you. They give you money. They say yes without you even talking to them. It is like selling toilet paper at a Chipotle restaurant. Unfair, manipulative, and frankly kind of funny. And I'm going to go so far to say that if you're trying to make money and you're selling anything else and you're running into difficulties or your business isn't growing as fast as you want it to, it's because you are not using one of these three methods right here to sell your product and your product does not have this inside of what you're selling. I don't care if you're a beginner. I don't care if you're an experienced entrepreneur. If you wrap this into what you're doing, it's going to be so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] easier to make money because people are just going to give you lots more of it with lot less resistance. So, have I sold it up to you? You ready to get started? Okay, let's begin. Also, before we get started, super quick, subscribe. I give all my courses, all my old business lessons, how I run my advertising, how I do all my copywriting, how I do all my sales pitches and scripts. I give that to all my subscribers once a month in my community tab, but you must be subscribed to see it. So, you should subscribe if you want those. It's free and it's like thousands of dollars worth of courses back when I used to sell courses. I don't do that anymore cuz I'm so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich that I I really just don't have to, which is why I'm going to give it all to you for free right now. So, look, the key to making a lot of money is being able to sell a lot of what you're selling with very little resistance. If there's a little resistance, people are going to give you more money for it with much less difficulty. I I think we all get this very quickly. But the thing is, people don't think about this. They just think, "What am I going to sell to the market?" They don't think, "How am I going to get my claws into somebody in a certain way that they cannot stop paying me money?" And more so, how can I easily get the clause in there? And then finally, how can I make it almost irresistible for the person to let me get my claws in them, make it just something that they prefer. They find everybody else out there selling a product and they come to me over everybody else. How do we do this? This is how you do it. So, the reason why a lot of people have trouble selling is because what they're selling doesn't have a clear defined ROI in the person's eyes that they're selling it. There is nothing that is countering the pain of buying. Whenever you sell someone something, you ask them for $50, $100, $500, $5,000, $10,000, there is a pain that comes with selling or buying the product from you. And so you have to have something to alleviate this pain. You have to have something that is far more comfy than the pain. So for example, if I came up to you right now and I said, "All right, I'm going to give you $100, but you have to pay me $50." You would do a double take. And you go, "Wait, what? You're going to give me double the money? Did I pay you?" And you would say, "Yes." And then the person would give you that a hundred times. And so what you need to find instead is a situation where the paying the $50 right here is substantially less than the comfy that you're selling them, which is the $100 right here. Now, I know what you're thinking. Alex, if we go around giving people $100 bills for 50 bucks, how are we going to make money? Well, you're not going to make money like that, you stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And that's not what I'm going to propose you're going to do. What we need to do is we have to find a way that people view our product as a $100 and view what they're paying us as the $50. If we can go and get this situation done right here, then we're going to make a lot of money because people say yes to Comfy. And so, I don't care what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sales pitch you're using. I don't care what strategy using. I don't care what your webinar script or sales process or anything is. If you don't have this situation in your pitch, it's going to be very hard to sell somebody. If I go up to you and I say, "Hey, give me $200 and I'll give you a $100 back or I'll give you some vague description. I won't I won't give you something back that's defined clearly as money back." Then you're not going to do it. you're just going to view it as a tax. You're going to view it as something that you don't want to buy, but you either have to. And so, the only way you're going to be able to pitch at that point to somebody is you're going to have to force them to have to do it. It's like paying their damn electric bill or paying their damn car insurance. Like, you don't want to do that. Nobody wants to pay their car insurance, but they have to. If you want to sell product like that, that's fine, but it's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard. And I don't like hard. So, how do we make this easy? Well, there's three ways you have to go about doing this to make it extremely easy. So, the first thing you need to understand to make this easier than finding a girl to swipe right on your short ass on Tinder, because we all know those are very rare. Don't worry, it won't be nearly as hard as that. The easiest way to make this easy is to sell breakage. So, what is breakage? Now, look, if you want to sell e-commerce products or something where you go and like fix someone's skin or something like that, that's a whole different other game. We're having to like really really sell stuff. I don't like doing that. I like to sell breakage to businesses. And if you can do this in a people's normal day-to-day lives, B to C, you can also do it as well. What is breakage? So, for example, if you go to a doctor's office, and this is just one of a billion different examples. Don't think you have to do this in doctor's offices, but if you go to a doctor's office, and let's just say they have their phone line, and this is a picture of a phone, okay? It has a that's a phone. All right? And let's say that they get 20 calls a day, okay? and between the hours of 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., they're just losing all these calls and they're just going to a voicemail and no one's following up with them. Well, let's imagine if we go and like make a little AI that actually responds and does all the chatting and everything for them and then books the appointment later that week right there. Just a simple situation right here. Let's imagine if they're getting 20 calls a day and there's five calls a day coming in between these hours right here. This has the potential to increase their business by 25% if we just get these people booked as well. So, let's imagine their business is doing 100,000 a month without this and they're able to increase it by 25%. Now, they're making 125k per month. What we just fixed right there, what we just found was breakage. This little system, this little problem right here between these hours of 5 to 8 a.m. was causing a huge breakage in their business. It was causing a leak in their bucket. By us fixing it, we increase their revenue by 25,000. Now, we can easily bill them 10 to 20% of that. So, let's imagine we go and bill 10% of that. Okay, we have a 2500 per month service right here if we're selling this. We could even automate, make it super easy, have a software that does it, for example, that's the type of businesses I build and we could build around 5% of what we're making them. So, we build them almost a,000 bucks per month and we don't even have to do anything. They just show up, they sign up, they get this result right here, which is what I like to sell. If you're a newcomer in business, you want to sell the services where you manually go and do this and maybe you build a custom solution for them using AI or some type of AI agent assistant or something like that. If you're experienced in business, you want to build automation so you can scale. It's pretty easy to get a business like this one to 100 200k a month, but then it becomes hard because you're doing a lot of manual labor. The way you get to a million, multiple millions of dollars a month like I am is you have to build a business like this. Regardless, what you want to first look for is you want to find breakage because if you look at all my pitches for my best products, for example, my software company, Hyros editor, show the website right now. It's very pretty. Look at it's look at that design. What we do for companies is let's imagine they are spending 500k a month to get a million dollars return in ads. What happens when people plug hyros in and the reason why our company has grown so fast is because essentially we connect in people's ads and we eliminate about 10% of waste in the ad account and we increase the ad efficiency by another 10% which usually results in people growing their ads by about 15 to 20% when they come on. So the result of that right there is them making an extra 100k a month at least from their ads. We can easily then go and bill them 5k a month. No problem. We can even just get them to pay upfront. The pitch is basically like, "Hey, do you want to make an extra 100k a month?" Yeah. Okay. Will you pay us 5k a month? We'll do that for you. And if it doesn't do that, we we won't bill you. So we basically just guarantee the free money. That is why the pitch is so damn easy at Hyros because we can just virtually guarantee it. And with most services in B2B, you can you just find the breakage in the business. Hyros was a fantastic example of breakages in people's ad tracking because people don't track their ads correctly and ad platforms can't all track it correctly because they all criss-cross across each other. We found that breakage pow business grow with the business by normal SAS valuations being worth multi-9 figures. Now next thing you should be selling and by the way all these lessons they all overlap on top of each other. So if you combine them all together you have something even more special. So next thing you should be selling is what I like to call stealth fish hooks. All right. So what is this? So, what we want to sell is something where people inadvertently put the hook in their mouth without knowing it and they don't realize the hook is deep in there and they have to leave it in until it's too late. So, what do I mean by this? So, let me give you an example of what we sell at Hyros in our air product and how it's a perfect stealth fisher. Now, I realize I'm talking about Hyros a lot here. Don't worry about that. I'm not pushing you to buy Hyros or anything right here. I'm just showing you how I designed my businesses and showing you one of my most successful businesses and how I designed it. It's probably the best example. If you don't want to buy Hyros or anything, that's completely fine. And I'm not here to pitch you. I'm just going to give you all this content for free so that you like me when your business does grow. You'll probably use one of my softwares in the future. So, what is a stealth fish hook? Well, a really good example of this before I talk about business is just going to be Stripe. All right. People go and set up Stripe, the good old payment processor, and you go and set up and it's free at first, and you just go, "Oh, okay. Not so bad. This isn't so bad." And then people go and they start making, you know, 10K a month, 100K a month. And then they check the bill and realize they're paying these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] three to $5,000 a month to run credit cards. Well, what do you do at this point? Nothing. Because you need them to make that 100K a month right here. They put a stealth fish hook in your mouth and now it's locked in there. And suddenly, as your business grows, Stripe becomes one of your largest largest bills that you get every single month. And you never even saw it coming. Okay? So, I'm not saying they're scamming anybody or stuff like that. Like, you you need what Stripe does. But again, like this is an example of a self fish hook. So for example, what you want to do is you want to sell something that is free up first and starts delivering results before they're ever built. So the way I designed one of our products at Hyros Air, which is basically it's an AI agent people put on their site. It detects the returning customers and are anonymous visitors and then runs AI marketing to them that almost every single time on average increases the business by 3 5% or some cases 10%. It's actually pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nutty. But the reason why air is so cool and very similar to Stripe is because we let people come and set up for free. They can come on and they can start generating money with it free. And so what's going to happen is a person comes on the air, they come in there, let's say they have a 100,000 per month business. Air is clearly going to start generating them on pace to be making an extra five to 7K per month. And then once they start seeing this money coming in, that's when Air starts billing them about 5% of what it's generating them. And all they see now is 5 to 7K per month coming in. They don't even mind this bill right here. And so what we got them to do, and I want to emphasize at the core of all these things I'm doing is providing value to the customer. It's not like we're like tricking people into giving us money and in a in a a extractive situation where now they're suddenly stuck paying us money and not getting return. What we aim to do or how you should design your business is if it's automated, you should try to get about 5 to 10% of the value you bring. If it's a service or manual labor, you should aim to get about 20% of the value you bring. Aka the customer is always winning the end. If you have a business where the customer loses in the end or is unhappy, it's not going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] work. Just I don't I don't think I need to explain that, but a lot of people build businesses where it's like, "Fuck my customers." And they wonder why their business doesn't grow. Anyways, people slap air on their site, they put that stealth fish hook in, it's so easy for them to jump into. And if you can remove the resistance, for example, like it's a Shopify store, they click one click, the things on their site, they check back later, they're making free money. Then we build them some of that free money. This is how you want to structure your products. If you can ever get people try it for free and start making money and then you once they are making the money or they are making the growth or the results they're wanting, then you start billing them, that hook is in there and they're never going to leave and you have subscription. It goes on forever, which is the best type of business to run. So that is a stealth fish hook. Now, finally, if you apply this last lesson, this is how you get sales so easy that it's easy. I'm done making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] metaphors. All right, you guys you guys get the jokes. All right, I've hooked you enough. So look, the way to make sure people buy what you're selling and you attract customers effortlessly is you need to sell custom fits. So what do I mean by this? If you were running ads for businesses and you just run ads for all businesses, you're going to have a really hard time selling to a doctor. So you call up a doctor's office and let's say let's say you call up a doctor who specializes in noses, okay? You got you call up the nose doctor and you say, "Hey, like let me run your ads. Just give me some money per month." He's probably going to say no. But if you make your website all about ads for nose doctors, you have an extensive testimonial board of other nose doctors. If your business name is nose doctor dude, the creativity has plummeted as these videos go deeper on. Look, if your your business name is nose doctor ad dude, he's going to be much more inclined to give you the money. Okay? Especially if you find breakage and you're selling them a $100 bill for $20 and you're selling a self fish hook where they don't have even have to pay money upfront. You get that hook in there and you're specifically custom optimized for the nose guy. See, the best way to start up a business, for example, if you look at Clavio, when Clavio launched its email sending services, uh I I know this very well because I had an email sending company at the time and Clavio [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] us up and they beat us by using this strategy. Mailchimp and everything, all the email centers that you've already probably aware of, they were dominating the market. Everything was commoditized. There was no way to get an edge in the marketplace because they were already selling everything for like two bucks. It was ridiculous. What Clavio did is they made their email software only for Shopify users basically. And by doing this, they gained not the entire email market. They didn't get much of that at all, but they got the entire Shopify market and started managing the emails for almost every single Shopify store. What happened is that built them a I think now like a $5 billion company. And that allowed them to get the edge in. And so what you want to do on top of the things I just talked about right here is not just selling the breakage, selling the self fish hook. Go and make your business specifically for types of other businesses. See, the way a market is going to work is let's imagine this is an entire market for people that run ads for businesses or something like that. What you want to do is you want to find the tiniest sliver of the market that's not really being marketed to and you just want to market just that because a lot of times these parts of the market are just not being marketed to. They're they're um they're just they're having to go with generalist. All right? And so most of the market is going to be generalists who who do everything and these generalists are not going to have the ability to service this tiny part of the market like you can. So again, if you're doing it for a nose doctor, if you have all your ads optimized for nose doctors, you have custom audiences in Facebook and Google and everything based around people that need nose jobs or whatever, you have proven landing pages, templates that work for nose doctors, you have follow-up processes, you everything in your business is optimized for these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No one can provide a service that works as well for nose doctors as you can. Thus, you will [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dominate the market. Now, is this going to make you a billionaire? No, because you're not dominating the entire market. But can it make you a millionaire or multi-millionaire? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yes, it can. So, in conclusion, what you want to do is you combine those three things together and that is going to make m making money easy because what a lot of people try to do is they sell products that don't fit the criteria that I just mentioned and then they try and overcome it by using all sorts of sales tactics and techniques. For example, if you look at the make money online niche, how many people are selling similar make money online niches? You'll probably see 15 commercials like that as you watch this ad. They're all selling the same exact thing. So, it's not attractive to you at all. They're breaking all these principles. So, if a person is selling you like a make money online course, the ads you're probably going to see right after this video, they're selling something that doesn't have that clear money back to you. It's not a $20 bill for $100 that there's no stealth fish hook. You have to eat a ton of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to get in the door and it's not specifically optimized or different. So, it's not even attracted to you. And they're trying to overcome all this with some elite levels of sales. So, for example, if you look at my business, Hyros, like our ads are pretty plain Jane. If you look at our site, like I'm not using a lot of internet marketing sales tax. It's like I know all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] things. I could get you to buy thin air if I wanted to, but I don't because it's a pain in the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ass to get you to buy thin air. I'd rather just sell you something or sell a business something where I don't have to try. I can get on the phone and literally be like, "Hey, it's $100 for $20. You're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if you don't buy this." And they're like, "Yeah, I agree. I'm going to buy that." That is the sales situation I want and that's what allows me to easily scale. So, when you're doing your businesses and if you're having trouble making money, think about why your product is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard to sell and not how you can sell more of it by being all sales smart and stuff like that. Read less sales books, make a better targeted product. The end. Now, if you want to learn how to do sales, you want to learn how to do that, guess what? I have my special $5,000 secret mastermind. You I'm just kidding. It's all on this channel. I have videos that are linked right below this video on how to get from your first zero to 100K a year, 100K to a million a year, a million to 10 million per year.

TITLE: How To Make More Than 99% of People Working 3 Hours A Week
VIDEO ID: 3AO3tO83Wdw
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AO3tO83Wdw
================================================================================

Oh boy, look at the title of this video. How to work one hour a week and make millions of dollars per year. Oh, that just screams sleazy late night sweaty, sweaty, sweaty infomercial, doesn't it? And look, that title might even make you a little bit mad. You might come here on this video thinking, "Oh, this guy's going to sell some sleazy get-rich quick course." And all I have to say is maybe the problem's with you. There's a reason why you click this headline. It's because you are a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You want to work one hour a week, spend the other 39 hours a week making waifu tier list on Reddit, and make millions of dollars per pure. that's why you clicked it. I'm not the problem here. And to add on to that, instead of being the problem here, I'm actually going to deliver this for you. In this video, I will break down the process you can actually legitimately use to work 1 hour a week and make millions of dollars per year. I am not joking. There is no hyperbole. I've in fact used this process to build a net worth of multi-9 figures. And I've scaled up what I'm going to show you in this video. And while I work a lot, because I want to make that much money, I'm going to show you to shrink it down to very few hours a week and then make lots of money from those very few hours. See, the thing is, realistically, I could probably work about 3 to four hours per week and make millions and millions of dollars per year. I don't do that because I like to make tens of millions of dollars per year and I eventually want to make hundreds of millions of dollars per year. But you don't have big goals. You're kind of an average 5 foot2 neck beard kind of guy. You make a few hundred,000. You could sit in your mom's basement, collect Pokemon cards, and never talk to another girl again. I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate them, too. Which is what my goal is for you in this video. And also, FYI, I've also used everything I'm going to show you in this video to get comedically rich. So, I don't have a course or anything to sell you. It's all just going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be here clear as day. And all the skills and tactics you need to actually apply this after you understand how to view this, they're all on this channel. They're all here for free. There's nothing for sale here. Let's get started. So, look, I'm sure if you're watching this video, you like money and you want to make lots of money. And I'm sure if you also are watching this video, you don't like to work. You've probably read all the books like the four-hour work week and all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's on YouTube trying to sell you some passive income lifestyle business from your laptop travel to Bermuda with Only Fans girls kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And at this point, probably none of that has worked because I'm going to tell you straight up as a person actually knows how to make money. All that stuff, it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Everything I'm going to tell you right here is the truth. And my business model is not convincing you that you can be free and make money and live in Bermuda and bang other equally short women on the beach. No, no, no, no, no, no. This is how to actually make a ton of money while working very, very little. And you have to build up to it. And then once you understand this process, it becomes quite clear. So the first thing I have to tell you is ddownload all that stuff you've been taught about. It's all it's all nonsense and it takes too long to learn. Anyways, I'm going to fix this all for you in like literally 10 minutes. So, here's the thing. And as I do this, I will put waifuss in the corner for you because I know you're ADHD. You can't go anywhere without touching your dick or watching a Tik Tok real. So, I got to keep your attention because this is very, very important to your future. If you do this, you're going to be able to print money for the rest of your life. So, let's get rid of this problem right now and make you a very rich rich, albeit very short man. So, look, I'm sure you've been told this before if you're into any type of money-making, but we're going to start from the basics. A lot of people think that work and hours in equals money out, and this is just not true. For example, I can I I went to New York City about a week ago and I drank profusely for the first time in a long time. Just just really getting nice and drunk and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everywhere I went. It was fantastic. As many old fashions as I could possibly have. My liver is going to die. That being said, during that time frame, I made hundreds of thousands of dollars. I actually sent a few text messages and closed almost a million dollars worth of business while I was there. And trust me, I wasn't working. Okay? I wasn't. So, obviously, that's not true. you can make infinite amounts of money regardless of the amount of work you put in. Now, in that same time frame, there was people that were, I don't know, mowing lawns or doing landscaping. They were working like 20, 30 hours that same exact week and sweating their dick off. Have you ever seen that? That that's hard work. Okay? When people get on the internet and tell you to work hard to succeed, what I do isn't hard work. I sit in front of my computer and scream at you and play and diddle with my team and build cool stuff at my software companies. I don't consider that hard work. going out there and doing landscaping work, mowing lawns. That is that is balls deep hard work. Like that's that's scary. I wouldn't make it if I needed to do that. I'm far too lazy for that. But again, these people put in way more hours of work, much harder work than I was. I wasn't even working that weekend and they'd made one zillionth of what I made that weekend. So, you need to get out of your head that work hours and work effort equals money. This doesn't mean you don't need to work hard. What it means is that you need to understand how to put your work in so that then it starts paying dividends no matter what you're doing. And then you work hard with this method and you'll be able to print unlimited money like I was talking about early in this video. So here's what this actually means and I'm going to put this in perspective of becoming a YouTube creator. This applies to everything in business. It does not just apply to YouTube. This is just going to make it very easy for you to understand. It's a great metaphor. So what this ultimately comes down to is leverage. This means being able to do very very little and make huge amounts of impact with that little bit. So instead of having to put our full weight into moving a 1,000 lb boulder or in your case that extremely fat heer that most of you date, they they're heavy. All right, look, you're going to have to put on some serious muscle. You're going to carry her on her wedding day. That is a that's a big that's a big lass, but I know you guys are in the chunks in this channel, so that's fine. I accept you for you. Anyways, what is way better, the better way to carry your ridiculously fat girlfriend is you need to set up leverage, which is for example, we can set up a pulley system where instead of having to use your full body weight and put your entire 5'2 mass in the listing, this 6'4 Amazonian whale that you your lady uh you could instead just move a finger and you could lift her all over the place. She wouldn't even need to move anymore. She could get even more chunky. Okay? All right. So, you get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] point of what I'm saying. We want to make it so that we can use very little effort to get huge results. Now, how do we do that reasonably? So, I'm sure you've been told what I just told you billions and billions of time if you've watched money-making YouTube at all. It sounds really cool in concept, doesn't it? But how do you actually do that? That's what the other YouTubers aren't going to tell you. I'm going to tell you how to actually do that because you have to start from the base level and then you build out from there. So, here's exactly how you would build massive leverage as a content creator. So, let's say you are going and making a YouTube channel. And again, do not put this all into becoming a YouTube creator. I'm not telling you to become an influencer. I'm telling you to view all work in business like this. So, look, let's imagine you're making YouTube videos. And so, what does your work involve when it comes up with making ideas, all right? And let's say this is your superpower. You're really good at making ideas. There's filming. Okay? And this is this there this there's going to be a lot of writing and drawing in this video. This is going to come out very bad. It's going to be editing. It's going to be writing scripts. It's going to be distributing content a bunch of things like this. Okay. So, excuse me here. I'm I'm really trying to write. I'm seeing the flaws in presenting via a $2 uh content setup. All right. So, look with these things right here. Let's imagine each of these takes I don't know uh 1 2 3 4 5 10 hours a week of work. Okay. We're not we don't need to be specific or correct here. The point of this video is the point of this video. So, focus on gathering the point. So, imagine doing all of this, this 50 hours of work equals one video that does really well on YouTube and makes you $1,000. So, let's say you're making 4,000 a month with this. One video a week, 1,000 a week, 4K a week. Okay, let's imagine you you reach some level of confidence in YouTube making your first business or whatever making 4K a month. Very, very low level business. So, you have all this working right here. What we need to do is we only have these 50 hours. Let's imagine we can't work 120 hours a week. What a lot of people do is they're like, "Grit your teeth and work harder. P yourself the dick." And that that works until a certain point. Let's say we double this to 100 hours a week and then we're making 8K a month. Again, we get back to my analogy where I'm closing millions of dollars worth of business just by sending text messages on a phone. Clearly, this is not the way. Okay? If you look at Jeff Bezos, if you look at anyone who's a billionaire, they make hundreds of millions of dollars for probably about an hour of action. Again, there is no connection here between working. They don't work these amount of hours. If you look at Jeff Bezos, he works like 40, 50 hours a week max. So again, we have to find ways to leverage our time so it gets maximum impact. Going and working another 100 hours is not the way to do that. So we're going to get that type of mindset out of the way. So look at this point again. We're making 4K a week. Now let's imagine that the source of all of our secret powers is the ideas. This is why the videos really make money because you are original here. This is where the creativity, this is where all the good ideas, this is where the sauce is at. All this other stuff down here is work. So, what could we do? So, we're making $1,000 a week, $4,000 a month. We could go instead from this 4K a month and take $200 and pay someone to edit the video once per week. Even if they're not as good as at anything as we are, we could train them up and teach them and give them advice and everything like this. So, we can remove this 10 hours a week from what we're doing. So, we're paying them $200 per week. And now we're going and making 1.2 2 a week because now we can make almost 1.2 videos a week. So we can increase our output to five videos per month and this would take us to 5K a month. Now again, we just increased our cost by $200 per week for having that editor. So again, we're breaking even right here. But what I want you to look at right here is that now we're working 40 hours a week to make the same amount of money as before. Okay? So that 5K that we were making now, remember the 4K we're making before, what we did is we took $1,000 and we gave it to that editor every single month. So, we're still making 4K a month, but we're doing it with less hours. Do you see how that works? That's how we just gained leverage. Okay. So, then let's imagine we're making that 5K a week. We do the same thing with distribution. We hire a distribution team. Okay? And we take that and we go and take another $200 out a week to pay them. Okay? So, now we have distribution team. This has cut our time in half. And so, now we're again making 6K a month for the original 4K a month to still be coming in. But look what we've done here. We've taken 20 hours off our work week. And so you're starting to see how we're actually starting to get way more money for our time by allocating money to leverage. Okay? Again, we were working 50 hours a week before. Now we're working 30 hours a week. You see how this works? So let's imagine what we're able to do now is we've we've mastered the the ability to come up with ideas, the ability to film ourselves, and the ability to write really good scripts. Okay. So what we could actually do is we could find someone that can write scripts just as well as we can. Okay. Okay, we find someone that can write scripts as well as we can. We again start paying them 200k or 200 $200 a week to do this as well. So, this is going to again cut another hours out of our our work week where now we're making 7K. You see the same exact pattern. We're still making that 4K. Don't worry, I'm going to show you where this gets juicy here in a second. So, only thing we really have left to do is come up with ideas and film. All right, so now we're in 20 hours a week making the same 4K that we originally making right here. You see what we have now is leverage. So, what could we do now? We have that other 30 hours that we had before completely free. So, what could we do? Well, we could actually go and double our output right here almost. We could get to almost 2.5 videos a week. So, now all of this doubles. We can get to 8K a month in actual income because now we've doubled our videos coming in while paying our team. Okay? So, we're going to be making almost 10k a month right here because our output is so much better. All right? So, you see what we're doing right here. We have this extra 30 hours right here to make double the videos. And these are the things that actually make the money. And this is where you get the high amount of ROI from your time. That $1,000 a week that was coming in before wasn't coming from this right here. It was coming from these two things right here. And now we can do double of them. So now we're still paying our team double per week. Remember we were paying about a,000 per week before. Now we're paying about 2,000 per week because the output is doubled. But the thing that's actually making all the money, the ideas in filming is now doubled the output. And we're working the same amount of hours that we originally working but making double the money. You see how that works? This is how you need to start viewing everything. Now, if you're an entrepreneur, you're going to realize that the filming and the filming isn't even important. The only thing that really matters is the ideas. So, what you could do is you could actually hire someone else. This is what an entrepreneur would do. And you have them do the filming, you have them do all the videos, you have the team make the script, and you just have ideas. So, literally, the ideas were the only thing that were making money right here. You've lowered it down to 10 hours a week just making ideas. And what you could do at this point right now is you could do two things. one, you could just coast. And so this is how you work a couple hours a week and make a lot of money because we've set up so much leverage and only reduced our work down to the thing that makes the money, which is the ideas. Okay? So, if we wanted to be lazy, we could just stop working right then and focus on working only 10 hours per week making the ideas, which is the thing that makes money. But if we want to make a lot of money and 5x this business, we take all this stuff that we used to be doing and then we 5x the work right load right here and we spend 50 hours a week making ideas or whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] else we want to do or improving the ideas and moving the business forward. So, let's back up real quick in case this isn't clear. At the start of this, we were working 5 hours or 50 hours a week to make $1,000 per week. What we slowly did is we started buying our time back by allocating the editing, the script, the distribution, the film. And again, remember the ideas is the only thing that's actually making the money here. This is where all the money, that $1,000 per week comes from. And what we're able to do with this is allocate more and more time to the thing that actually makes the money to the point that we can reduce down to the money. It's the ideas. It's the ideas. For example, if you look at Apple, all the the manufacturing, all the work that goes in, the millions and zillions of man-hour go into making an iPhone aren't actually what made the company rich. It was the sitting around and making ideas and the original product and the design of the product and the few things that go into how the app store and everything work. You got to think about think about the iPhone. How does it make really so much money? It's that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Apple eyes store that people use and they make 30% of every single business on there. How long do you think it actually took to build compared to how much it makes? Leverage. So what you're seeing right here is we reduce down to the only thing that's making money. And so if you want to work very very few hours, what you reduce down to is the thing that's actually making the money. And then you just keep it right there. You could keep it to 10 hours if you want to make that same type of income. But if we want to 5x our income, what we then do is this is where I talked about working harder. We can then 5x our workload on the thing that's actually making money and get everything else out there. So we're making maximum leverage of our time. This is how you make a ton of money. So for example, let me lay this out for my company. So I have a wonderful amazing team. That's the reason that we're successful. What I do at Hyros my company is mostly come up with the ideas in product design. Okay? And then I pass these ideas and the vision and the mission for the team. And this results in for every single hour of ideas or anything I put together, this results in hundreds of hours of actual manpower and work being put behind those ideas. And so every single time I go and do 30 minutes of work and thinking and then I pass that to my team, it results in hundreds, thousands of hours of work. Jeff Bezos, for example, when he has an idea or something to change in the company, it's the same exact thing multiplied times a million because he has a million employees backing that one thing. So I'm not saying that you need to learn how to hire employees or anything. I'm saying you need to have different ways to turn your time into leverage. So for example with AI right now or editing for example if I was in the same situation right here where I was in that type of business where I need to spend my time editing what I could do is I could reduce the amount of time I edit by learning AI skills to reduce it from town hours a week to 30 minutes a week and then bam I bought my time back again and I'm able to then either reallocate it into the thing that's making money or just not work anymore. And so what you're looking at, for example, at Hyros, what I've done and any other software company or any type of business out there, once you've built a business to a certain point and you've hired people to do the roles, the maintaining, the managing of payroll, the customer support, the leading of customer support, all those things right there, I can actually not show up to work at my software company for months if I wanted to. Heck, I could even hire another CEO and I could reduce my workload down to one hour a week if I wanted to and the company would not grow in the same way. my income would not be growing because that's my job as an entrepreneur is to gain more leverage and grow the company, not work in the company. But you see right there, if I wanted to go and maximize my amount of free time, I could just hire a CEO from all the systems and leverage that I built and then he manages the leverage that I built and I just tell him what to do maybe in a two-hour meeting every single week. And that right there is how I could make millions and millions of dollars per year working very little. Yes, I'd have to keep giving up money. You saw as we kept going down that leverage chain, we kept having to go and hire high hire more and share more of our revenue. But then we kept putting time and manpower and and leverage behind the thing that's actually making money, which was the ideas. And the core of making money is not ideas. That's not what I'm trying to say here. I'm saying recognizing the things that actually make the money. And as we give up that money for our time and creating systems and leverage, what we gain is more time back to the thing that's actually making money. And eventually, it's just going to keep growing because you're focusing on building more leverage for the same one hour of time or 50 hours of time you have per week. And that'll keep growing. And there comes a certain point where the leverage is so high that you can either just buy all your time back by giving a little bit more away. So for example, if I hired a C at Hyros, let's say I'm making, this isn't my income right now at higher. I'm making much more than this, but let's say I'm making $5 million per year. I could go and take $2 million per year of that, give it to a CEO and someone to run a company, and then I'd be at $3 million a year not working. And I could do that over and over again. I could go and build another business that makes me three million. This isn't efficient. I'm just stressing out the idea that I want you to take away from this. I could go and start another company that makes me $3 million per year, $5 million if I was actually running the company. Give us give that to a CEO, boom, I'm making $6 million a year not working. That's how you have to understand how time and money correlate with each other because all this time I'm building leverage. And so what you're doing is instead of putting 50 hours a week into working, you put 50 hours a week into leverage and building systems and focusing on the thing that actually makes I'm not going to spell this right at all, but you get it. putting all the time and money into building leverage and then eventually that leverage gets so high that you can hand the leverage off to someone else or you can keep managing it and increasing the leverage and growing the company. And this is how you become either a person that works very very little but makes a high amount of money or a person that works a ton and makes a ton of money. This is the same system for both of them. I've used a scale to where I am and having a multiple nine figure net worth. But that's because I work every single day. I've been working every single day for 15 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] years. I could have cut it all off years ago, a decade ago, and been making 500,000 million, $2 million per year pretty easily. But I I want I want to keep growing. I enjoy doing this. It's a lot of fun. So that's what I'm doing. If you want to do the opposite and work very little, you do the same exact thing. It's the same exact thing. No matter what you're doing, you're always focusing on leverage. So that's the video. I think I delivered the sauce. The sauce has been delivered. You should follow me on Instagram because I have all my courses and everything there for free. And uh also every business tactic I've talked about in this video, whether it comes to building, selling ads, everything I've used to grow my business, they're all on this channel. Here's a few videos right here that show you how to start and get to a couple hundred,000 per year. There's another video that shows you how to get from a couple hundred,000 per year to a million dollars per year. There's even one that shows you to get from a million to 10 million per year, and that's a really cool one, and it's all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] free. I'll see you later.

TITLE: Why Having A "Personal Brand" Will Ruin Your Life

================================================================================

gentlemen and two women that watch this channel. As the number one business advice guy on the internet, I have to give you one piece of advice. Don't ever become an influencer. Just just don't do it. It is the worst way to make money in the history of making money. And almost without exception, every single influencer ends up broke, poor, frustrated, and in this weird purgatory like hell that's mixed between being a aging Miami stripper and an very underpaid plantation worker who cannot get off the plantation, cannot keep working, or their income will go to zero. It is terrible, but many people don't see this because it all kind of goes on behind the scenes. And this is why so many people 2025, they're whipping out their phones. All the kids want to be YouTubers. Everyone wants to be an influencer because they think it's a way to get rich fast. And the truth is, yes, it is. It's also a way to make sure you're poor for the rest of your life and just ruin everything and hate your life. And in this video, I'm going to walk you through how that happens and show you the one caveat, the one way to actually transition this, make influencing work so you don't end up in hell. Because that's where most influencers, most of the people you see online chuck in their supplements, chucking their courses, becoming really big for a period of time. This has happened to all of them. We've even seen it happen literally in the last four or five years to most influencers, even the biggest ones possible. The bigger you get, the worse this impacts your life and the more poor this makes you eventually. And I'm qualified to tell you this because I was going down this path in my 20s. I saw this and said, "Fuck no, no more." I stopped doing it and I built the type of businesses I'm going to talk about in this video that you should be transitioning to if you ever get into the influencing thing. And that allowed me to build a near multi-figure net worth without having to make videos, without having to shake my ass on the internet. And right now, I make videos and I make content in a very specific way to make sure I never end up in this hellhole that most influencers end up in. So, if you're considering doing this in 2025, I think I've laid out the scary warning enough to catch your interest. Let's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] talk about this. So, first off, when I talk about influencing here, I'm talking about people that go and get normal famous on internet, then have to sell courses, have to sell cosmetics, have to sell any type of product, that type of influencer. Look, if you want to go shake your ass on only Only Fans, become an Only Fans guy, or if you're one of the two girls watching this channel, only fans go, I think we all understand that's a bad idea. Naturally has consequences later on life. So, I'm not going to touch on that. You got my full support. Go ahead. If you're a talentless [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and the only way you can make money is taking off your clothes and showing your tits or your acornsized dick. I know some chicks are into that. I fully support it. Make the money however you got to make it. That said, I want to talk about the more normal type of influencer. So, the reason why everybody wants to be an influencer is you see everybody get into influencing and then they blow up and then they get rich by doing nothing. So, for example, you see all sorts of examples of people like Libert for example back making tons of money. You saw for a period of time Logan Paul converted his fame into prime and it supposedly was almost worth like a billion dollars. I think you saw like Dan Lock a few years ago just slinging courses making a ton of money. Now he's completely disappeared. There was Jeffree Star another really good example super famous in skincare and stuff like that making like 1520 million launches of a skincare product then completely gone. And I can really count on one finger like I think Mr. beast and maybe I I can't name any other influencers off the top of my head that have started in the last 10 years, built a company or product. The product is now super extremely successful, kept going, and their career is still going in a nice comfy way. I can't name anybody like that. And I'm not talking about mainstream celebrities. I'm not talking about celebrity, the Kardashians or something like that. That's a whole different other thing. The YouTube social media influencers, what I'm referencing here, because they don't have the advantage that celebrities have, which I'll get to in this video. So, what am I trying to point out here? Every single person you see who goes and gets big on the internet and then makes their money from being big on the internet, eventually this terrible, terrible thing happens to every single one of them. And if you don't see this coming and you try to start a personal brand, you try to get into influencing, it's going to happen to you. And you need to know about it because it sucks. It doesn't matter what level of influencing you get to. This happens to everybody. And the bigger you get, the more dangerous it actually becomes cuz you you get so addicted to this hype train right here that's going on that you're going to get caught by it completely blindsided unless you're abundantly aware of it and you're building your business the right way. So without further ado, let me explain this phenomenon that happens exclusively to social media influencers. It ends up putting them into purgatory social media influencer hell. So, what happens is you get on the internet and a lot of people start watching your videos, especially if you're a hit upfront and you start building up this huge following of people and they're willing to buy basically whatever you sell. If you get big enough on the internet, you get big enough on, you can sell literally a carbon copy of anything else that's working on the market and they will just buy it all up. They'll buy tons and tons and tons and tons of it. Really good example of this was like Logan Paul's Prime. He just launched that billion dollar valuation company. Absolutely exploding. But every part of your business and every part of your brand and every part of your products is not based on value. And this puts you in a really dangerous situation because I want you to think about products that you use every day in your life. All the software that you use, all the the food products or cosmetics or supplements or anything you have around you that you consistently buy over and over again, it's all based around value. You probably didn't have an influencer tell you to buy these things. You probably didn't even see an ad for them. you probably just kept buying them because you like the product and the value you get from it. For example, I love chameleon cold brew coffee. I drink a lot of these things every single day. For all you people that know I got off caffeine, this is this device that I have. Uppers are just my thing if you can't tell in the videos, but I keep the uppers of that. I only do cocaine, a little bit of X before like every other fourth video if I'm sleepy or something like that. I keep it mostly clean with the caffeine. Pinky promise. But look, how many influencer coffees or how many influencer drinks have you seen come and go in the past couple years? How many people have you seen come out to the scene, get really famous, like everybody's raving and raving about about them, they start selling courses and everybody's buying them all up and then they just kind of disappear and slowly people stop watching their videos. For example, like Andrew Tate four years ago, millions of views every single video. I don't even really know what they're doing anymore. This isn't like a a plug or anything on that. Maybe they're doing fine. I don't know. I'm just saying that what happens in social media is when you are selling products that are basically commoditized and don't really have a particular value other than your brand to them. The only thing that's actually fueling your brand is hype. And the only way you can actually make money is extracting from your followers. This is how you spell extracting in Cllingon, by the way. This that's what the con the handwriting is. So this becomes very very nasty up to a point and you won't spot it until it happens. See what's going on right here is your business model is based around two things that are very hard to sustain. Hype and then sustaining hype while also extracting at the same time. Now, I'm not saying that every social media influencer is a scammer or anything like that. But when your your entire product is based around these things right here, this is what's pumping it up. For example, I don't think Prime Energy Drink is a scam at all. I just think it's it's a pretty average product in a completely commoditized saturated market of energy drinks. And so when your product is completely backed up and based on this, your business becomes doomed because these things are impossible to sustain. Okay? The only thing that really keeps people buying long term is going to be value. You can be the most famous person on planet Earth. If your product doesn't have the value or it's commoditized, basically when your hype starts to go down or starts to wear off, the value isn't there to sustain it and then you just eventually lose all your money. But this is what people don't get about influencing and the extraction model. And by extraction, again, I want to stress, I'm not saying that they're scams. I'm saying that you're basically pulling money out of your audience. And when the value isn't there behind it, where they're put where they're spending $1 and they're getting four back in their mind, whatever the result of the product is, what happens is it can't be sustained. And so the product eventually kills itself and then the hype ends up not being sustainable and that doubles down and double kills the product. So for example, if you look at like Prime Energy Drink, that thing was making so much sales, the sales are down 90% now. Why? Why? It's because the entire thing was based around hype and extraction. I'm not saying it's a scam. I'm just saying that it was pulling money out without giving equivalent value back and the hype wasn't able to then sustain it. But you can look at this with every single online influencer. Look at all the make money online gurus who have popped up in the last 5 years. They are now gone. Look at all the people that popped up in skincare and cosmetics and protein powder and lifting stuff who were got really, really, really big. Now they're all gone. Look at all the influencers who were getting hundreds and hundreds of thousands of views in 2020 2021 and now they're not getting any views. And so to make this point clear, this is a lethal way to operate because you do not want to there's only one thing worse than than being broke. It's going from broke to making a lot of money to then being broke again. And so the reason why this model never absolutely works is because it's again based around hype and extraction. And you're might be thinking, well, you can't keep hype going forever. Well, no, you can. For example, if you look at like Taylor Swift or most mainstream celebrities, the Kardashians, uh they've kept the hype going for like a century at this point, but that's because they are assisted by the mainstream media or the corporate media who has permanent control over what people view and what people see. So, it's not really based around what people want to see and what they want to click and where their hype is is going. It's basically they tell people, "This person's famous and you need to follow them." And they control the airwaves. are not going to take these people off TV no matter how boring or whatever they get. They don't have to keep shaking their ass to the same degree that originally made them famous. For example, you're just going to keep seeing Pedro Pascal everywhere regardless if you actually like them or not. He's just going to be famous whether you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like it or not. You You want Pedro Pascal in the movie? Guess what? There he is. You go to a movie, four out of five of them Pedro Pascal. That that's just what you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] get because this is what they tell you to eat and a lot of people eat it. But this is an advantage that social media influencers do not have. Because what you need to understand is why this hype is unsustainable on social media is because the algorithm is basically always looking for the next popular person. So when you become an influencer, it's basically like you are an 18-year-old at a Miami strip club. So you're there, you're perky, you're hot, everyone's really into you. And the club promoter, who is the algorithm, is going to be like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're you're the best thing ever. going to be pumping up, putting on the posters and everything, but then you go and you you turn into rotted middle cat 22. I don't know. For the the two girls watching this channel, it's been nice. It's been nice knowing you here. This is the speech that's going to chase away the last two watching. But all right, 18-year-old girl turns rotten at 22. Let's just say 30. Okay. All right. We'll we'll retain the two viewers. Anyways, what's going to happen to the strip club is the promoter and everyone is going to say, "Okay, well, this person's not the the new best thing." and there's going to be another 18-year-old that they want to promote to make money because it makes them more money when someone's getting popular and based on what the customers want. They're going to have a hard time selling and consistently boosting up some 30-year-old stripper who's aging out of the workplace when there's again hundreds of little 18-year-olds waiting in the lobby for their chance to play. And so, the audience is going to be one more fascinated with 18-year-olds. The algorithm is going to be more fascinated with the 18-year-olds. And you are going to have only one option to keep the attention and the algorithm backing you is you have to just get more extreme and shake your ass harder and harder and harder. You don't get to keep doing the same stuff that got you famous at 18, you have to double down and triple down or whatever cuz not only are you aging out of everything. On top of that, everything you've done has been seen before. So, I'm sure you've seen influencers that got really big like a few years ago being like alpha male red pill Andrew Tate style. You saw the influencers that got big doing that. Like everybody's seen these videos now. Like nobody [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cares about women ruining men and men's basic lifestyle. They don't care anymore. You can see that's clearly on the decline now. And all those guys who built their brand around all their views are starting to decline because the algorithm just doesn't care anymore. It's all been seen before. And so the only way they're going to be able to get back and keep making money is they're going to have to switch it up and shake their ass much harder and do something different. But they've already done so much extreme stuff like how much crazy stuff, how much crazy stuff can you see in videos? How much crazy lifestyle can you show before it just becomes boring? For example, a really good example, Dan Blazerian back when he started his first content of posting strippers and whatever on on Instagram. It was all cool. I I thought it was pretty funny. You know, he's riding around the club throwing cake at people, drinking, uh doing drugs, doing steroids, hanging out with hot paid escorts all the time. Looks like fun. But you can see over time people just got tired of it. People stopped caring and he didn't change it up. and he just got old and now he's like 46, 47 selling like courses on how to date women and nobody's watching his videos. Nobody's really cares about Instagram and his company imploded because the hype and everything isn't there anymore. Very similar to every other influencer out there. And so you can see based on the system right here, people are promoting other people in his place now. The algorithm is like, "Okay, done with you. You're not going to keep people clicking. You're not going to keep their attention." Pow! Right back to new 18-year-old. And think of all the 18-year-olds who are coming up right now that are famous out of nowhere. I think like a good example would be like Aiden Ross or something like that. I'm not saying these people are going to fail, but the internet becomes obsessed with other people and they forget about everybody else. This is the difference between this and a mainstream celebrity where you have control over the narrative. The algorithm is going to constantly keep replacing you. Now, here's where it gets really, reallying lethal. As you age out of this and the algorithm stops rewarding you, you're just going to get tired. Trust me, I was making videos when I was like 22, 23, and I was building up my brand. And I was getting more famous on Instagram, doing these events, speaking stuff like that. And I was launching courses and whatnot. And I was like, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is like tiring. I am I'm tired of having to constantly create new videos and new ideas and new oneup myself over and over and over again to keep attention. I'm tired of having to constantly release new courses and a new next best thing and constantly keep the business going bigger and bigger. And I started to see my flywheel starting to slow down because of this exact problem right here. So I was like, I got to find some way not to be wrapped up in this. I can't do this until I'm 40. I can't make doing this the core of how I make money. I can't make it the cornerstone because I'm just going to get tired and eventually I'm going to run out of things to one up myself in and then everything's going to go down from there. So, that's when I went and started software and whatever. And yes, I still make videos on YouTube and whatnot. You've probably seen over the last like decade, I've managed to maintain a pretty consistent view count because that's because I've changed it up, gotten into crypto and whatnot, but those videos are for fun and I do that kind of mostly out of enjoyment. The reason why I started making crypto videos was mostly for giggles. And the reason why I make these videos is for a completely different reason. I'm not trying to get famous influencer famous. I'll explain why in the business model I'm going to put down right here in a second. That's the solution to this. But I basically separated my ability to make money from my personal brand because you end up in this hell right here where eventually the algo stops caring about you and you end up in influencer purgatory. Look for example at like Liverp. He had to keep one uping himself, one uping himself and becoming more and more extreme to the point that he actually just got in trouble for becoming too extreme and people just stopped caring. If you look at a lot of like the health in influencers out there like the bodybuilders or any of the uh health supplement guys out there, every single person out there, especially on the younger range gets big and then they end up in purgatory hell where I'm sure you see these people now where they're not getting any views, no one cares, they're still slinging the same products and stuff like that, except they're just not making the money that they used to. And there's no way they can get it back because they were a 30-year-old aged out stripper and the algorithm doesn't care. People don't care. And because their business was not based around value, all their products, nobody cares. For example, if you look at like again, I'm not saying Logan Paul is going to fail from here. I don't know what his trajectory is. But I can tell you as he's turning 30, 30ish, wherever he is now, people are starting to not care. And you can see that in the Prime Energy sales right there, they're down 90%. Nobody's probably going to come watch other boxing matches. And so, he's in a really tough place right now where he's probably older now. He doesn't want to do the same shenanigans that's going to get all the little clicks on the internet. Both of the businesses are making a lot less money now. He's built up this really big lifestyle and now he only has one way to save himself and that's by shaking his ass so much harder and doing extreme stuff that the 18-year-olds won't do. That's the only way back into it at this point. And so this is where every single influencer ends up unless they build their business in the way I'm going to talk about right now. And this is why as you're starting your personal brand and building up, you have to be deadly aware of this. And you need to be having a plan like I'm going to talk about here to parachute out of this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] when you're getting near the peak and out of it. You do not want to make this your entire thing. So, how do we do this and what's the solution to this? So, really good example of me. I used to have a big personal brand and like make money online and courses and stuff like that. And as that was growing for me, what I did is I built a brand that was not about me and doesn't rely on my face. For example, Hyros and my software companies online. They don't require my face to grow. Okay? I I can stop making videos tomorrow. They will keep growing because it's one based around value, but two, I'm not just saying build good businesses. As I was going up, I was able to make money for my personal brand and my courses and whatnot. And also use them to get clients for my services and all sorts of stuff I was doing. And I was always making little mini softwares trying to figure out how to do software. What I was doing is I was cash flowing the personal brand and the influencer brand into actually building valuebased products. Now, I'm not saying things we were selling back then were not valueless, but I would compare myself to any real other influencer out there. I was making products that weren't really different than anything else in the market. And so, I realized that I was going to be doomed here pretty eventually because I was turning 30 and I was not going to be able to keep this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] momentum going forever. And so I then started putting all of it in the software. And I took that money, put in the software, and aimed to build long-term businesses that didn't rely on me making videos at all. And this is what you need to be aiming to do. You need to think as you're going up, all right, how can I turn this into a long-term business where if I disappear, the money is going to keep coming in and the business is going to keep going up because that's the only way to do it. You have to have a product that's just truly better than anything else on the market. And this is actually the whole crux of the entire thing. If you're trying if you're trying to become an influencer, you need to be creating your escape path very soon because there's almost nobody that does it well for a very long period of time because what also happens is your entire attention, especially as you get up here goes to growing your personal brand and creating the hype and then you can't focus on the product and software. This is why it's even more dangerous as you get to the top because every one of your skill sets and everything is around this hype and this personal brand and not on product creation and actual value creation. And so you get locked into this and so you can't even build something that's valuable if you want. I'm sure you've seen tons of influencers. They keep trying to build businesses, but they all suck. It's because they're spending too much time at the strip club shaking their ass instead of taking care of customers. So again, it's just a such a doublebladed sword. The only other advice I would give you right here is if you really want to make this work and you want to do the hype and the personal brand, I have two pieces of advice for you. One, make sure this is what you want to do for the next 30 years of your life. For example, if you look at like David Ramsay or Tony Robbins or some of just the really long-term people that have had personal brands for a long time, they did two things. One, they made sure this is exactly what they want to do for 30 years of your life. A lot of people come in and they want to dabble in or they don't think 30 years in the future. If you are not ready to shake your ass at the strip club for the next 30 [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] years, don't do it. Two, you have to be willing to go hard as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] For example, if you look like Alexozi and his content stuff right now, he went zero to absolutely all out. And I'm pretty sure he's going to he's down to do this for the next 30 years of his life. You have to make sure you're willing to talk and run the brand hard for 30 years. There is no in or out. Next, focus on gaining respect instead of hype and attention. Look, I'm not telling you to model anything I like do for example in crypto. Crypto is my crypto channel, for example, is going to suffer from this exact same situation here in the future. I guarantee it. That's why I haven't made crypto and everything my main career. I guarantee you, you're going to see this exact same funnel thing happen to me. My crazy crypto channel of all things, people are going to slowly stop watching. It's going to lose traction and then that channel is going to be dead. That's why I'm actually playing for this to be my last bull run in crypto because I see this curve happening right now. Even over there, it's extremely important that you understand that you can't keep the hype going forever. What you can keep going is respect in the industry. And this is going to actually result in you getting less views. So for example, if you look at some of the smartest influencers like David Ramsay doesn't get a ton of views. What he did is he made himself very very respected in a niche of an industry. So not everybody knows about him, not even everyone's watching his content, but he made himself respected and was able to carry that long-term success to sell his products. Now, in my opinion, the best thing you can possibly do is when you are climbing up this ladder, you focus on building a long-term product that's unique and based around value. And you keep making attempts at this. You need to go and actually build a long-term company. For example, with Hyros, when I was growing my personal brand, I kept trying to build softwares and finding something to click. And I learned a ton about building software. Then I built Hyros, which grows automatically and it's independent of any of my channels. My crypto channel doesn't help it. And I only started making these business videos recently because we're adding products to Hyros in the future that are more mainstream. And so I want to be able to talk about those on the internet. But again, I'm not doing this as the cornerstone of Hyros the software company. The cornerstone of it is really good products that deliver a result for customers. And that's why it's kept growing throughout the years despite my uploading and influencing this being inconsistent. You you can notice I don't even use Instagram or Tik Tok for example. I do it because I want to, not because I have to. And that is why becoming an influencer is so damn dangerous because eventually your entire brand relies on you doing something you have to do instead of something you want to do. I really doubt a lot of people as they turn 32, 35, go into their 40s want to keep shaking their ass on social media and trying to influence and create the next big thing. as all these 18 year olds and 20 year olds are flooding in the space will only to do just about anything and our new interesting and algorithm loves them. Not only is your promoter trying to betray you, but you're also getting tired and drained of energy and the attention of the internet which is fickle as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is slowing down at the exact same time and then you end up in hell. So that is why becoming an influencer in 2025 is a super bad idea.

Uh I think we've made the point in this video. I'll see you later.

TITLE: FBI Persuasion Scientist Breaks Down Alex Hormozis 105 Mil/Day Pitch
VIDEO ID: QuxwyZq4oI0
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuxwyZq4oI0
================================================================================

I don't know if you saw this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ridiculous. My buddy Alexi literally made $105 million in a single day, 24 hours via his book launch stream on YouTube he did earlier this week. You might have even seen a very good-looking, talented, buff, and extremely rich young man on that stream as well, but he's too humble. He wouldn't want me to talk him up, so I'm not going to do that. What I am going to do in this video is I'm going to break down every single tactic that Alex used. And then I'm also going to give you free courses, literally the entire blueprint that will allow you to replicate this for free as we go through these tactics in this video. It's not going to require an opt-in. I don't want your money. You're just going to get these entire courses that I made in the past covering the tactics that Alex used, specifically webinars, live selling, and closing. I'm just going to give you these as the video progresses or link you to them where I have them stored on YouTube. So, you're going to want to pay attention because these courses absolutely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I had some of the best webinars and closing courses back in the day when I sold courses for money. I'm too [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich now to do that anymore. So, I just give the content away for free now. It's not my business model of choice to sell courses. I'm a software guy now. But, I'm going to give you these. And the reason why you want these is because I personally believe Alex is the Michael Jordan of internet marketing and marketing period of all time. There's no one that's ever done it as well as he has the past couple years. Him and Ila and their team, incredible. Now, that being said, everything you saw him do on this stream, everything you saw him do on YouTube, it is bread and butter internet marketing tactics. What you saw on the stream was not any new marketing technology. It's all stuff that's been done hundreds and thousands of times in internet marketing done at its highest level with brand and all the work that Alex and Ila have put into building all the trust and rapport with millions of people. But what I'm going to do in this video is break down every single tactic that Alex used, explain why it's so effective, so you can kind of see the matrix of what's going on, and then I'll actually give you full courses that teach you how to do these tactics on your own. All the pitching styles, all the closing styles, everything you saw, it's all going to be demystified in this video cuz I used to be back in the day the webinar [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You go by a red light district in Vegas, I was there whoring out webinars for a time period in internet marketing. I think I was probably the best webinar writer. and live closer in the space. I was building business after business that was making millions of dollars per month running ads to webinars that closed people to high ticket products, which is exactly what Alex did. So, I'm probably one of the most qualified people to tell you exactly step by step what he did here, explain it to you. Then, like I said, I'm going to give you the courses that I created that taught this process 100% for free. And there's literally no catch. Actually, there's one. You got to be subscribed because when I link you to these courses, if you're not subscribed, the link will break because you won't be able to see the community section on YouTube where I link you to all these courses. So, let's get started. Let's begin. So, what I want to do right now is break down the entire funnel to you and explain each step and why it's being done. Because look, I used to write these things and this was my core bread and butter selling process for almost five, six years. This is what I did all day, every day. So, as I see Alex doing these things, it's it's almost like watching someone, I don't know, throw a football when you've been playing quarterback for 15 years. Like, every part of the throw makes sense. But if you're new to this or you're new to marketing or you're new to business building, you're probably wondering why the f is he sending people to a live stream? What did he say in the live stream that got everybody to buy? Why did he do a live stream in the first place? Why did he give away a bunch of free products on the stream? And why did he stack all these products on top of each other and then ask for book donations and then sell something specifically at a $6,000 price point? And then why did he have all these mechanisms and why did everybody buy on the stream? All these things seem like and it looks like you you got Luke Skywalker using the force which he is. I'm I'm not taking away anything from Alex and Leela in this. I don't want to say anything they're doing is easily replicatable. I'm saying the tactics and strategy and the funnel and the format of the selling that's easily replicatable. The brand, the trust, the amount of people they got on, the reach, the ad spend to get everybody there, the business branding they built with acquisition the past five years or however long they've been doing it. Not easily replicatable, but the tactics and pitch itself are replicatable. And it's so damn effective that I'm not saying you're going to make $100 million in a day. But I used to crank these things out and I get a business to a million a month within like I don't know 3 4 weeks, 2 months of launching it. Because this process right here cooks if you know how to apply it. Okay. So I'm going to show you everything that's going on here. So how this funnel works that Alex did is of course you had all of Alex's organic reach and you also had his ads. All right. So you had traffic generation which is critical right here. Now, for you, if you want to get this part done, you make YouTube channels, you do Instagram, you get social media traffic, or you learn how to run ads, which I've broken down insane amounts on this channel. By the way, all the courses I link you to will take you through my ad buying strategies, which I I have one of the largest ad tracking companies in the entire world right now, Hyros, and also one of the best AI agent companies with the new air proc we launched. Trust me, you just put it on your site, you will see three to seven% more income from your business. It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ridiculous. I'm not even going to pitch it in this video because we can't even take that many customers on it right now. But you just put this thing on a site, it makes business like there's this one business right here, ecom store at a $25,000 in sales just putting this AI agent on their site and it's so damn good. We don't even charge for it upfront. Like you can just put on your site, you'll see the money coming in and then after you make money, we're like, "Hey, do you want to pay for this free money that's coming in?" It it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sick. I'm proud of it, but I'm not here to talk about in the video. The reason why I have the ad tracking company backing up to that is because I ran ads for literally a decade. Like I was all I do. I ran ads to webinars, which is what we're talking about right here. And I needed to find ways to track the sales that came from the webinars, which were very difficult to track because when you send people down this funnel, it usually takes 5 to 7 days for them to buy. So it's impossible to track it with Facebook or Google ads. That's what Hyros, my company, I originally designed to do. Now it tracks literally everything. But this is how I know so much about ads. And again, you'll get this course for free in this video. I'll give you the link here in a bit. And I'm going to strew these links for these courses around so you have to actually watch the video, right? I'm going to give one at a time in different places. Here's the ad course in the top right hand corner or popping up somewhere in this video right now. Maybe there'll be a URL you can go to. The webinar and funnel courses will be coming. So, look, if you want to get this done, you're going to go need to generate social media traffic or run ads. I see so many YouTube channels. For example, I I don't I don't care about your opinion of Ian Gazi, but a lot of his traffic all comes from originally all came from like YouTube and his Instagram post. So, we generate tons of traffic via free traffic. I like buying ads because I don't like having to dance like a monkey to generate traffic, but that's whatever. So, then what you're going to send people to is an opt-in page where they sign up for a webinar. Now, we did this cheeky thing back in the day because in internet marketing, we're pieces of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So, uh, what we do is these things called auto webinars where you have people sign up and it seems like a live stream is starting, uh, but you're not actually doing the live stream. Now, this still goes on to this day. I don't know how it still goes on because people are a little bit more techsavvy these days, but I mean, Tai Lopez, myself, tons of people. I mean, you're still going to see these doing these fake live webinars, sending them to it just generates the big bucks. Alex's huge thing right here is he did this fully live. And I doubt you're going to see Alex doing an auto webinar because it's a great way to break trust, especially when you're doing it on a large stage. So the reason why I did these back in the day is because I was sending tons of ad traffic every single day to these webinars. So it was impossible for me to do 50 streams a day, okay? So I could have this auto webinar playing. I think here very soon when we can have AI do webinars, so you have an AI live streaming the webinar that's indistinguishable from you. I think that's going to be one of the biggest cash cows ever. I don't know why people haven't made that product yet. If I was not doing Hyros, I would be dumping I would be fuming in my pants to make a product that does that and sell it. Okay. So, anyways, you send people to these you send people to sign up for a live stream, which I'm going to call webinar for the rest of this that is either automated or fully live. All right. So, for example, if we go look at Alex's site right here, this is not the stream optin. I don't think they have it live anymore, but you can see this goes and collects their information. And so, you're going to collect their email, their information, and you're going to send them a bunch of follow-up emails and announcements telling them when you're going to be live to give a presentation. Now, then what is going to happen on these is you're going to sell something high ticket. So, high ticket is something anywhere from 1K to 6K to I've even seen 25K on these. At this point, what you're going to do is you're going to use a very specific close sequence that is tied in to the webinar itself. See, the real power of these webinars, and I'm going to explain why you're doing this process here in a minute, is that you have people on live and there's massive scarcity because they can't get off live and they're going to lose the deals and what you're selling if they don't buy on that call. So you're able to apply all the highest most impact forms of marketing and sales and persuasion all in one place because to get someone from point A which is not knowing you or clicking on an ad or coming to sign up for your webinar and get them to spend 1,000 6,000 $25,000 with you or book a call with you where you can even sell something worth 50,000. I've seen it all done before. That takes some real freaking persuasion. And the only way to do it is with a funnel like this or a funnel where you send people to book a call with you and then you sell on the phone, which is what I prefer. And if you look at Hyros, for example, we use this funnel. I already explained that funnel about two videos ago. There will be a link to it popping up right now. There will also be a link to that one in the description because it's on YouTube. That will explain my entire call funnel at Hyros, which has built a company that is valued at multiple hundred millions of dollars. So, it's a pretty good funnel. you you should check it out. It's not too bad. But we're not talking about that type of funnel right now. So, what I want to do before going into each of these steps is I want to explain why we're doing this. So, I already gave you a little bit of a summary of why we are doing this. It's because in order to get someone to spend $6,000 with you or more, you need to spend a lot of time with them and you need to thoroughly convince them and walk them through all the steps of persuasion and then crush them with scarcity and FOMO to get them to move across this line. Now, I know what a lot of people who are not in sales are going to think about this. They're going to think this sounds evil and manipulative. Yes, that's what sales is. It's it's manipulating a person to do what you want or persuade them. Now, the thing about sales is it can be used just like the force. It can be used for good or evil. So, for example, uh I've seen these webinar funnels used to sell the biggest croc of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you've ever seen. There's all the the Amazon automation and crazy stuff that we saw like four or five years ago where people just getting ripped off left and right and people running these auto webinars. So all sorts of nonsense. It's so effective at persuading people that yes, you can use it for evil. You can also use it for good and to get people good products. So for example, when I ran my webinars to get people on the high and stuff, Hyros delivers results or people don't pay for it. So if a person comes on Hyros and they don't see their ad ROI grow where they're making 10x what they pay for hyros, they just get a refund. They don't pay for it. But Hyros has been around for like five, seven years. We have some of the biggest clients in the space. Hyros delivers that result. So I use this process to sell things that get results. Or for example, if you looked at Alex using this, he used every single persuasion or manipulative, whatever you want to label it as technique in the book. But his product rocks and people are really happy with it. And those things deliver results. That 6K that you give Alex for the example, I really I really don't think people are going to fail to get an ROI on that product. They apply it. And I'm pretty sure he has a refund strategy or something like that. So before you jump into this is manipulative and evil kind of stuff, the best sales push people to their absolute brink to get them to close on something. Now there are brinks you can push people to on here that are unethical. Like getting people to take out massive debt they shouldn't do. You can like really push people down a rabbit hole. And I've seen it like events where they're taking retirees outside and they're getting them to call their banks to take out a $25,000 loan to pay for some some nonsense. There's all sorts of unethical [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we can do with this. It depends on how you use it. So, I had to give that little pretense because I know a lot of people that aren't used to sales just automatically hate sales in general. It it's the force. It can be used for good or evil. Anyways, the reason why we use this is it's we go and put people through this entire persuasion process. And this is what you need to walk people to the point where they're ready to actually spend and they believe you and they think they're going to get something for the high amount you're charging. Again, you have to deliver after or you're going to be in trouble doing this. Okay? I I saw a lot of people the last couple years get in trouble with the FTC and stuff for using processes like this to sell stuff that did not deliver. So be careful. Be careful. Use it for good. Then what you do once you walk through this is you crush them with all the elements of scarcity and FOMO that you can only really trigger on these live or simulated live events. And that's what results in the huge pimple popping sales results that you saw Alex do right there. That's why you saw everyone all his customers from like four or five years all bulked up all buy on this single call within 24 hours. It's because you can accomplish this with the streams. So, let me walk you through every one of these steps and and how this is going to work. So, first step right here I talked about before, just imagine we're sending people to a page. I'm sure you saw Alex's um live stream page where we collect people's information and we get them to sign up for either a live stream with us or an automated webinar. I'm not going to teach you how to make the automated webinars in this video because that's an entire different course which is linked to right now. There's a URL appearing in the video. It teaches how to make the automated webinars that I used to run. Use them for good. You can do some funky [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] with these. Anyways, you're going to send people to these these webinars, get them to sign up for a stream. Now, during the webinars, what we're going to be accomplishing is a whole bunch of things. So, you get people to come and attend that webinar with you. And you have to understand there's different phases to a webinar. And this is why these things work so well. Okay, so the first thing and the reason why webinars work so well is because you have the person locked in. All right, they can't go and if they if they leave, it's the same thing if you're watching a stream on Twitch. You're going to miss something. Okay? And so the way a really good webinar format works and I'm pretty sure Alex used the same exact script right here because this what you need to understand about sales scripts is that universally there is a pattern that you follow when you communicate with people to persuade them to do things. Okay? And so every sales script is universally going to tie back into this pattern. People might say different things. They might change steps here and there, but overall they're going to be following this pattern every single time because the pattern to convince a human to do something is exactly the same no matter what. So what you're going to do on webinars, and again, this entire script and all the processes I write these webinars, there's like a 4hour video in these courses I'm going to give you breaking down the entire script. Okay? So, I'm not going to give the entire script right here. Just wait. Just wait. Let me pretense this. So, what's going to happen right here is the first 10 minutes or so, you're going to build trust and rapport and belief. Okay? So, I want you to imagine a sales pitch is like punching someone in the face. Okay? And what you need to do to really deliver as much damage as possible is you need to get the person to drop their guard, lift their head up, be completely listening to you, and wide open. All right. When people come on a webinar, what is happening is they are not wide open. They're skeptical. And basically what you're trying to do in the entire webinar is show them something that's going to work and get them the result that they're looking for while quelling their skepticism meter. So whenever you're selling to somebody, they have this skepticism meter that is constantly refilling. It's like you're playing a video game and this meter is constantly going back up. And even when you get it back down, every single time you make a claim or you say something's going to do something, the skepticism meter pops back up and you have to keep knocking it back down. You got to get the skepticism meter to zero and then you have to cross a line when it's at the lowest skepticism possible and induce FOMO. Okay? So, you get the person to a point where they fully believe everything you're saying. They fully have faith it's going to work for them. There's no doubt in their mind that it will work and it seems so consistent it will work. And then you go and use FOMO by basically offering them a chance to replicate this without any without doing anything. Basically, this is what you people want push button results. That's the best thing to sell. But you then go and you make an offer, but then you use massive amounts of FOMO to get them to cross over and complete that. So they believe it's going to work and then you need to find every single way like a pimple to push them across the border to get them to buy something from you by using various methods like adding value. For example, you saw Alex Extreme. He added tons of value by adding additional offers. You have a timebased scarcity. You have something that disappears in the future. You have a no- risk guarantee. You remove all the risk. And so, you think of all the obstacles that people have to buy. You remove those. And you think of all the things to make them have to do it now that makes it just too good of an offer. And you add those. And doing those, you increase FOMO and get people to to buy. So, keep these in mind as we go through this entire process. So, what you're going to do is you're going to build rapport. How do you build rapport? Well, one, you introduce yourself, of course, but then you start verifying all your results, who you are, and why you're qualified to teach this. Okay, that's the most basic thing. There's a lot of really interesting things you can do, like having someone else introduce you because it actually makes you seem more of an authority when someone else is talking you up instead of yourself. That's what I actually used to do on my webinars and why my webinars were so effective is because I was never actually the person making the product or doing the teaching. What I would find is other people, so if for example, if you see all these gurus and influencers on on uh YouTube or whatever, they always seem to be like the the expert on something and they're always like moving with like the flavor of the month. Two years ago, they're selling ecom, now they're selling AI agents, now they're doing this. There's no way they can teach and be the expert on all these things. See, I realized that back in the day and instead of trying to make like crappy content that didn't work, I'd find the best possible people in the space and I'd partner up with them to make the course. So, I'd have the best people possible to teach it and I'd partner with them and I would actually handle all the selling because that's what I was really good at. So, what I would do, for example, is I had my buddy who was one of the top Shopify sellers of all time and we had a Shopify course, okay? And so, what I would do is I would have it come on and I would talk him up and show all of his results and all of his replicatable results and I'd also show the results of everybody else that has copied as his tactics and then say, "Look, this is this works. this works and we're going to be teaching you how to do this on the day. So, we're basically hooking people to sit in through the webinar and building massive amounts of trust through this. Okay? And then what I also like to do is you want to hook them to stay longer in the webinar by offering bonuses, additional content, and really talking up this strategy they're going to get into. Now, what we got to do at this point is we've built some trust and authority. And throughout this webinar, as we make claims, we're going to have to constantly come back to this trust and authority and proof. Anytime you make a claim or you say, "Oh, this is going to be amazing." You're going to have to back it up. So, for example, in Alex's event, every single time he talked about his results, he'd go find results from his clients. He go find results from the businesses he's acquired and apply these playbooks on or he'd show his own results over and over and over again. Now, you also then have to build actual connection. Okay? So, you need to hook someone with the results and trust that you can actually deliver what you're talking about on this. But before we actually deliver the content, we need to build connection. So on the webinar, you probably saw Alex showing tons of pictures of himself when he was in college and stuff like that. You do the same exact thing because you want to tell the story or the arc of the main character. It's just like a movie. So in our webinars, for example, Matt used to be like this broke guy who was in college and is pissed off as most men are. You're going to see this is the character arc for most dudes. We we hit about 20 and we get mad cuz we're broke and girls don't want to date us and so we set out to make tons of gobs of money to fix the glaring hole of insecurity that we have with ourselves. same arc every single dude. You can find every picture of every successful dude in like a college dorm room, pimples on his face in front of a computer like and this is this is it's a pretty common arc. That's what I'm saying. So anyways, you probably saw Alex doing this and what I would do is I'd show pictures of Matt and I tell his entire story of starting in Missouri doing all these things and how he actually got started making Shopify stores. Then he started templating the process and he started repeatedly using the template of the process to uh build I I think his stores are he's still absolutely crushing it. He's one of the largest Shopify sellers in the space but showing how he used the build I think on the back then he was doing like 200 300,000 a month uh in total Shopify sales or something like that. Okay. So what I'm doing is I'm telling the arc I'm building this connection with Matt. people see where I came from. And what I'm doing is making it seem whether I'm lying or not, which people lie all the time about this, or you can do like what Alex did where he actually came from nothing and most people relate to it. You're making the person who is actually going to be the teaching and so on in the course seem just like the person watching. And so you're making the connection what people, they don't care about anyone other than themselves. And so you're making the person relate the main character to themselves and view themselves as the main character and then showing the main character themselves going and getting the results so they see themselves which is for example if you're selling mostly to young men which we were that was the main demographic people signing up for e-commerce courses back showing them going from being the the zero to the hero to growing. And then what you want to do is make everything seem repeatable. Okay. And this is where we come back basically to building the trust again by showing other people then taking the process that got the hero from zero to hero and then showing how repeatable it is. Okay. So after you probably saw Alex showing his connections uh or his uh old college history old pictures to build connection he then showed how he got those results. He built a business and all the things he was doing and then he shows how he then took those businesses turned into a template and other people started going getting results. He probably showed that with gym launch. I'm not going to go through Alex's entire 12-h hour presentation, but I can almost guarantee you that's what he did on the stream. So, after this, look at what we've done with the person. We have a person who now trust us and we've proven we can do it. They've built a connection and now they're now saying themselves go and get the result and they now believe that it's down to a repeatable system that they can follow. Okay, this is where we actually then do the teaching. And so the teaching on these webinars, you're going to notice on these, yes, if you're doing a good job, you're going to give some people valuable information, but the teaching is what we've hooked people to go through this 15minute presentation for. All right? We've hooked them all the way here to go to this teaching. And the goal of the teaching on the webinars and the sales stream, this is not nice. But if you're doing a really effective one, it's not actually to teach. It's to make people believe what you're teaching is easy enough that they can do it. So, for example, on our webinars, the main thing we would focus on is to make the system seem easy and approachable. So, when it comes to building a Shopify store, there's a ton of advanced stuff we can talk about when it comes to it. But if you try to teach that in 20 minutes or 30 minutes on a webinar, you're going to make people really freaking confused. So, you need to dumb things down to the simplest levels possible and make it super easy. Now, when we taught this with our Shopify business, you might be thinking, "Well, that that seems manipulative." Yes, it is. When people got in, then we gave them advanced teachings and if they didn't make it work, we fully refunded them. So, I wasn't one of these people running these info businesses where you hook people in and run off with their money. We could get people and we had the best way to get them from zero to making success with the Shopify store, which was very, very, very [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hard to do. It's one of the reasons I don't sell courses anymore because it's so damn hard to get a normal person to actually come and apply what you're teaching and actually go get results with it. And so the refunds, if you're doing it ethically, are always going to be high doing that because a lot of people aren't going to get started with it. Okay? That's one of the reasons why I don't sell courses because I'm just done with that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't I don't want to deal with with managing people's lives and responsibility. I'd rather just give you the information for free on this channel. When your business makes money, if it does, come check out Airyros, make free money, come apply our tracking to your ads, make way more money from your ads. That's my business strategy. I don't want to teach you to build a business for money. But a lot of people use webinars to teach info. You can also use them to sell software and everything else. What you want to do in the teaching though is you show the use of your software, your service, or your information and you make it seem easy and replicatable. Okay, this is the entire webinar process right here. Look at where the person is at this time. And as you're going through this, you're always bringing up proof the entire way through. So, I'm sure whenever you saw Alex teaching, whenever he was teaching, he'd always followed up with and then look at the results that got this client or this person right here. So then what you're going to do is you're going to close. Now Alex did something kind of unique and he formed the first close as just free information given away. This builds massive goodwill. And so what Alex actually did there is one he did something really neat. But this is also the sales tactic of reciprocity because he just gave you something for free. You now want to give them something back. So for example uh a charity that used to go around airports and ask for money. What they do first is they go up to people and they give them a flower. And this drove the amount of money that people gave and the success rate of people giving the money for charity to the roof. If they didn't give the flower away first, it like dumped. Just absolutely plummeted. So what he did first before he actually started closing is he gave you something same way the flowers did. Now again, this isn't to say like Alex is a bad guy or anything like that. This is just one effective thing that people really like because building goodwill involves giving people stuff first and value first. Now at this point, he's going to go through the close. And so you saw a really traditional internet marketing close uh applied with massive goodwill and proof and brand and everything like that. If you just go and do this willy-nilly without all the trust and brand and goodwill that Alex has, it's not going to work the same exact way. It still can work very well though, okay? You again not going to make $15 million in a day, but you can go and build a very successful business if you follow this blueprint. So, when we're closing, what we're trying to do is we're going to go and make an offer and there's a certain price down here. And what we want to do before we get to the price is make the person the price in the person's head be much higher. So, if we're selling a 2K product, we want the person to believe there's 12K worth of value right here. And at the price of this any other day or any other time would probably be 12K, but for the day only, they can get it for 2K. Now, you can lie about this if you want. Not the best thing to do, but you can use scarcity in webinars to make this connection. Like, look, at any other time it's 5K. During this webinar, it's 2K. Alex made the pitch where like, if you don't get this unless you buy on the stream, like this deal, you're not going to get it again. That works even better. The more true the scarcity is, the better it's going to work. Like, I see people do these webinars, these internet marketers, and they say, "Oh, it's it's normally a $10,000 course, but today you can get it for $52, and there's no link for the $10,000 course anywhere online." Like, people see through this stuff. it it doesn't work. If you actually have a $10,000 course and you sold only for that 15 minutes, that's going to be very powerful. So, what you do in the close and what you saw Alex do in the close is you start adding value. Okay? So, we added his is you start adding scarcity with value. So, he added all of his additional past courses, all these additional procs, all these different things. And then what you want to do is start taking the price in their head. And so, you can see when he was breaking it down, he kept adding like this is worth $2,000, this is worth $5,000. So the total price of this is $25,000. You probably saw him do something like that. And so we're setting this huge anchor in the person's head that this is the value. So after we go and start adding value through different bonuses, courses, one-time things that add to the scarcity, what we're going to do is we're going to slash the price but keep the scarcity, but we're going to take it down to 12K today just for this webinar. All right? Just for this moment right here. So people are like, "Oh crap, this is all the stuff. That's the only time I'll ever be able to get it." The more true this is, the better it's going to work. Like I said, people doing this on webinars when it's not true, it still works if I'm being honest, but it's not going to work as effectively of what you saw or how you saw it work with Alex's because his was true scarcity. So then what you're going to do once you've made this disconnection is you're going to start again slashing the price more, but you're going to start adding more scarcity because hey, it's only this stream only. It's only for the next one hour. It's only for this time period, then it's closed forever. So we're adding scarcity to all this value and the price cut. And then finally, what you want to do is you want to remove objections as you close. So now that you've done all the scarcity and everything, you notice Alex sat around removing objections like, "Okay, if you're worried this isn't going to work, here's me in this exact situation. Here's 10 different people that got these results. Oh, okay, you think, you know, this might be too expensive. Well, this is he, for example, pointed out him buying the acquisition building and relating that and then showing a bunch of other people who took much bigger risk with him and made much more money." Uh, are you worried this won't work if you're 50? You show people who are in their 50s making money with it. You go through every single objection that your customers are asking and you counter them to remove that. Okay? Then what you want to do if you're if you and you want to be honest with us, this will get you in trouble is guarantee results. So at our Shopify course business, we guarantee the result if you weren't happy with it after a month that you can just get a refund. Okay? A lot of people are finicky with this. You see a lot of internet marketers out there, they go and offer guarantee, but it's only if you get to like a certain result in the course and then they just won't give you your money back. that's going to get you in trouble. Don't do it. I don't like I didn't like that business model even with that guarantee. So, at Hyros, you might notice I guarantee results at Hyros, but it's not an internet marketing thing. Like, you literally come on, you add it to your b your business. If you don't make 15% more from your ads, you just get your money back. Like, you don't you don't have to use the software. You don't have to pay for it. With air, for example, when you come on our AI agent, if it doesn't add 3 to 7% to your business, like you just don't pay for it. In fact, when you join it, like you don't even get charged anything until you see it clearly making you money. So that's how I like to sell because that's super powerful. Now with these courses and stuff when you're selling high ticket on webinars using this guarantee after objections, you removed all the reasons. There's massive scarcity. You remove any reason or doubt in their mind why they could buy. You've verified it with proof. Every single time you remove the objections every time you answer one of these questions, you verify it with proof. And then you back it up with a guarantee so there's no risk. So logically, let's look at everything we just accomplished on this call. We built massive trust and rapport. We built a connection. We swapped ourselves with the person watching the video so they see themselves going from zero to hero. We make it seem very very repeatable. We make it seem easy with our teaching. We build massive goodwill. We take them to the close which then walks them through adding value, building up the price in the person's head, slashing the price but making it time oriented through scarcity, removing all objections while adding proof and then guaranteeing it and then just sitting there and basically closing, closing, closing, closing, reminding people that like time's going to run out. This right here creates like a pimple-like popping amount of of sales because all this pressure builds up and it explodes. Now, the reason why it works so well for Alex in particular right here is because he hadn't sold anything high ticket, I think in like the last four to five years with acquisition. So, you had all this goodwill built up, all this pressure on the customers to want to buy something, and he saved it all for literally a 24-hour period that was live on the stream. who had it was like a a giant pimple that was the size of Mount Everest that he forced into squeezing with the ginest amount of pressure and true scarcity ever in a two three hour period. And that's why you saw an explosion of $15 million in sales. It took him four or five years to build this. Like I remember when Alex was originally starting acquisition like I I was friends with them back then and he was telling me about this thing and and I was like damn that's going to take a lot of work. They did a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] work. And so what they built there is incredible. It's the Michael Jordan of marketing, internet marketing. You should study everything they're doing. And I don't think anybody's going to be able to replicate what they've done with the brand and effectively applying internet marketing principles and fundamentals to the sales, but you can 100% go and copy the sales techniques and patterns because those are replicatable and usable. And that what I just broke down is essentially what's happening right there. Now, if you want to actually go write these webinars, you want to see the entire pitch fully explained in like a 4-hour video, there's a link appearing on the video right now that will take you to that. And you have to be subscribed or that link won't work. So, that's it's going to be in our communities tab. So, hopefully I've hooked you long enough and convinced you to watch this full video. So, that's the video. That's everything that goes into it. If you want to see every part of this broken down, it's been linked to in this video, all the courses and everything. That's all I got. Goodbye.

TITLE: How I Brainwashed Myself Into Being Rich AF
VIDEO ID: YXykmSflTpY
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXykmSflTpY
================================================================================

All right, you degenerate piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Like the title says, I'm going to be brainwashing you, Illuminati, indoctrinating you today to become rich. And I, your administrator, your doctor, and by far the most qualified on planet Earth to do this because, as you may not know, let's be frank, of course, you know, I'm kind of, you know, a big deal. But this mindset and indoctrination process I've given you allowed me to build a multi-million dollar net worth in my early 20s, a nine figure net worth in my early 30s, and right now closing in on a multi-figure net worth, which at least makes me not the worst [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] person on planet Earth to tell you how you should be thinking and how you should be tweaking your mind if you want to go from being a broken private jets, which frankly, if you've ever flown private, not the best idea. Very small quarters. Everybody look at you awkward when you come to the bathroom and the toilet, let's be frank, doesn't flush too well, so it's going to be very awkward for the next person in there. But you won't care because you'll be so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich and the only fans girls you're flying to Dubai with will just have to put up with it. This brainwashing technique actually allowed me to come out of the military in my early 20s completely broke and build a multi-figure net worth. Later in my 20s, build a multi-ight figure net worth. And best of all, I don't have a course or anything to sell you because I'm already [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich. Just enjoy the sauce. And all the things I talked about tactics-wise and building businesses here, they're all linked to below this video again for free on other videos on this YouTube channel cuz this place is just the truth. You should subscribe. Let's begin. So, look, brainwashing hyperbole aside, if you want to become rich and successful, it's not going to come down to some Tony Robbins ha coup, some mental masturbation you're going to do and some thing you tell your in your mirror every single morning. It's going to come down to work and actually applying techniques and skills to go and make money. That being said, if you view money and the making of money and the understanding of how it's possible to make money in a completely wrong way, you're not going to make money in the first place. The way that society and most people understand and look at money is just fundamentally wrong. So, while understanding this isn't going to make you the big bucks, you're not going to be able to move forward unless you have this understanding. So this is what you need to do because if you don't get past these things right here, these five specific things I'm going to share with you, five things, you really don't have a chance in hell of doing this. So the first thing you need to understand about all of this is that making money is not a special thing. It's actually completely normal. Lots of normal people do it. Lots of normal people become rich. And in actually once you get it down is not something that's even particularly hard to do. Let me explain this because you need to get past this. Number one, also if you're liking this video, I used to make I don't anymore, but I used to make lots of courses that taught people all the techniques I use to make money. Copywriting ads, how I sell products, my exact sales funnels, everything. I'm going to be giving those away to all my subscribers at a certain subscriber count. If you are not subscribed, when that happens, our AI will not scrape you up. You will not get those courses. So, subscribe and like the video. My most engaged followers, you're going to get all the stuff. You're not subscribed, I don't like you. So, you're getting nothing. So, back to the video. So, look, when I was in the military, flat ass broke, I was making like$24, $30,000 per year, which in today's dollars is like $952,000 per year. Money's inflated a little bit, but whatever. That's fine. Back then, I was broke as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I remember going and getting bar tabs and I'd spent like $150 a night and I was horrified and bank always overd it. It was a bad time. All right, that being said, why was there I remember people in the military, there were civilians there and they're making like 70,000 bucks a year and I thought that was like the epidome of success. I was like, "Holy moly." And then like one guy even made like six figures in the year. I'm like, "Oh my god, if I could just do that, oh my goodness." So, first thing you have to get about this is that the way I viewed money was in a very limited frame. And I thought making even low amounts of money was incredible. And I thought people being able to go and build businesses or even become employees to get paid several hundred,000 500,000 million per year. I thought that was impossible. something that's reserved for like Jedi Knights who go to college for eight years and do some impossible tax task and have LeBron James like talent. And so when you think about money like this and you think about it as some big impressive thing instead of what I'm about to show you it actually is, you're not going to go out there and pursue that. Who's going to stop what they're doing? Stop this societal path of college, getting a career, working a job that you probably don't like, and making less money than you want, but safe, comfortable money, which is what most people's goal is, and why they stay where they are. Why are you going to leave all that if you believe you're hopping into some chamber or some some journey that's impossible and requires the .01% of human behavior and skills and peak athletic ability to achieve, you're just not going to do it. Here's the simple truth. I've been doing this for 15 years. I have seen so many people that are actually stupid make millions of dollars. I've seen so many people go from zero to making millions of dollars per year that I couldn't even count it on all my fingers. I couldn't even count it if I had hundreds of fingers. I've seen it so many times. And what making money is is simply a skill like anything else. Playing guitar, learning jiu-jitsu, learning how to paint, drawing, I I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know. Playing World of Warcraft. Have you guys ever gotten good at a video game? It's exactly the same thing. what people do since money is so deeply connected to our egos and our sense of self and also taps into our survival instinct because in our society if you get down to zero dollars are bankrupt you're technically dead in societal terms. So you're playing with almost your life force when we're thinking about money and that's how it looks to a lot of people especially when you're at lower incomes. That's kind of what it is. You run out of money, you're in deep trouble unless you're one of those people that just accepts living on welfare which in America we're just happy to hand out here. So you're technically not even going to die. You could just go on welfare and start a business from there. Alex Becker tip of the day. Get on welfare. That that's that's video concluded. But backing up, what you must first get and how you must view making money and growing as money is simply something like playing guitar. If you sit down and practice guitar for 4 hours a day in a strategic way, you're going to get good enough on guitar to play in front of people and play music and you're going to be good enough to be good. Now, when you are making money to make maybe $100 million a year, build a $100 million net worth, you're going to have to be really really really damn good at it. To make $500,000, a million dollar per year, you're going to have to be like high school football player good at your sport. For example, not not so terrible that you're on the the sidelines the entire time, but good enough that you can play in like the lowest leagues. not going to have to reach some level of talent that is not unreachable to any person out there unless you're running around with some Spongebob Squarepants 60 point IQ. This is achievable for you and it's been done by millions and millions of people and it's going to just come down to repeating simple processes over and over again to improve your skills and eventually it's just going to happen. So get that through your head first. Now before we get into actual techniques and things you should be doing per se, the best way to change your mind in this this type of thinking strategy I just talked about is you need to go and associate with people about two to three levels above where you are. So for example, I myself at my net worth and everything I'm doing, if you try to associate with me, I'm going to throw pie at you and get the ick from your poorness. Don't don't come within 50 feet of me. I don't associate with the masses anymore. But serious note, that's just going to be the only thing that people take away from this video. They're going to quote that. Put that on Twitter. Alex Becker is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] There we go. Take the sound bite. But what I mean by two to three levels above you. If you go and try and message people when you're making nothing and they're making a couple million or million dollars per year, you're just it's just not going to work out. You don't network that way and it's not even beneficial to you because they can't even communicate to you things you understand. What you want to do when you're first starting out is there's tons of forums, groups, entrepreneur groups of people that are just getting started all the way to people that are probably making 100,000, 200,000 a year, maybe even 50,000 a year. Just people that have really gone and started out. I also really want to stress as you watch this video, you don't have to be an entrepreneur to make a lot of money. I have employees that are approaching eight figures net worth through working with me at Hyros just by having equity in the company. So, if you are just really damn good at something that makes businesses money, you can still make a lot of money as employees. Don't let me make you think this is a entrepreneur only video. Regardless, you need to go and associate with people that are in these levels and thinking this way and stop associating with people that are not. When I was growing up, I love my parents. I love my family. I love all my friends. But they are completely they were completely indoctrinated or uh believers in the typical life path. Do well in school, go to college, get a job, slowly work your way up to moderate decent income, and then retire at 50, 60, whatever. I'm not here to pick on that path. And I'm not here to pick on people that think like that. But you're not going to start thinking the correct way to make a lot of money if those are the people that you hang out with and talk about money with. You're going to do that by hanging out with people that only think about growing and making more money. You want to go and find the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] goblins on the internet who are just rubbing their hands together trying to get rich no matter what and hang out with them. And what you're going to see constantly is a you're going to see a lot of people go from zero to making that type of money. And you're just going to realize, oh, this happens all the damn time. Most importantly, you're also going to start associating with people who are constantly trying and and feeding and talking with you and helping you kind of level up. They're not going to be like helping you like mentoring you. Stop looking for that. You just want to find people that were the room or the culture of beliefs in the group is this is how money works and this is how you make money and you're going to slowly fall into that and you're just going to slowly start believing and operating in that way that everybody else in the groups are doing. So, Facebook groups, some of the guru make money groups. I know a lot of people hate Andrew Tate, but if you look at like his real life.com, I'm not or real world or whatever it's doing. I'm not suggesting go join that, but it's a good example of lots of people that are at least trying to make it and people that are semi- makingaking it to getting some level of success. There's thousands of groups out there. There's free groups, there's Discord groups, there's channels of people, there's uh school groups. You can go join Alex Hermosy's school groups. You can go to the endless places. just seek this out and associate with these people and get in groups where the belief works like this and stop hanging around people or at least taking anybody that thinks differently seriously. You can still have normie friends, but just like don't the way they view the world is just incorrect and wrong. If that's who you're spending and sharing most of your beliefs with, you're going to be wrong as well. Now, here's the next thing that people get wrong with this. They try to make money while still not making money the focus of their lives. Should money be the focus of your life? is is is money all that life comes down to. That's up to you. You your view of life doesn't actually really matter. It can be completely different. It could be completely wrong. We're all going to die and forget everything. So, whatever you think is important is important. I'm not here to debate your life view and Echar told you on the proper way to view the world. That's not it. But for a time and being, if you want to have financial control in your life to the point where you don't have to worry about money and you can do whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you want whenever you want, if that's your goal, that's not really that hard of a goal to reach. You need about $5 million in net worth to do that for life depending on where you live. That's very achievable, especially if you're young right now. So, the most important thing at this time in your life while you're trying to go and gain access to this financial control is you make it purely the most important thing and you remove all things out. The secret to growth and really getting good at anything is not adding bunches of things to your life. It's not going and doing some morning routine. It's not going and attending 15 Tony Robbins events. It's simply removing everything except the thing you want to do. So, for example, if you're a young guy or something that worked very well for me is when I really wanted to settle down and get to the next level in entrepreneurship, I sold everything. Moved into an empty apartment with just a desk and a bed and I moved to a city where I didn't have my family. I didn't really know anybody there. So, I had nothing else to do and I didn't have any video games or anything accessible or anything to distract me. I didn't even have a television. And all there was was just the work improving at the work improving my software company and growing. And that time period right there is what took me from eight figures to nine figures. It would also very much benefit you and you do it much much faster if you're going from zero to say 500,000 a year to a million dollars per year. So what do I mean if I could put this all into a tactic? If you're a young guy, young gal, the two girls that watch this channel, hello. Great to see you. I'm happy. I'm happy you haven't me yet. What you want to do is, for example, move to Wyoming. Get a stupid dirt cheap apartment next to a grocery store where you don't have to have a car. Maybe make sure there's a gym nearby or just go in the woods and lift rocks like a real man. That's what I do. Go workout with the squirrels. Just you and a bunch of raccoons. Have it like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] snow white moment in the woods lifting logs and rocks and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] That's exactly what you need to do. But once you removed everything from your life, I'm just picturing that. It's making me giggle. Once you've removed everything from your life, if you just have that computer, a bed in the corner, you're just going to wake up every single day, do whatever freelance work you need on to do online or do whatever cheap work, go work at theing grocery store and pack groceries, you'll be able to afford the apartment just fine then. And then whatever free time you have, you're just working on improving your skills as an entrepreneur or a very highlevel employee. So what I mean by like a highle employee, for example, the CTO at my company is a multi-millionaire now. uh because he's actually done this with a lot of different companies, very successful man, but he's a multi-millionaire because he got really really good at coding and developing software and then he got really really good at hiring on developers and building teams of developers underneath him and so that allowed him to be the CTO of our company and also spawn off or do like freelance work for lots of other companies and get cuts of their companies. So he's technically an employee of a lot of different companies, but he still makes a f ton of money. So you can do the same exact thing here, different strategy than entrepreneurship, but you can see it's really just comes down to mastering your craft to a point where you can really impact businesses. So backing it all up though, when you remove everything from your life, and there's videos below here on absolute removal on how to achieve that, video games, distractions, friends, any financial weights, getting your your lifestyle as cheap as possible, how just move to Thailand, do freelance work online, and live for 150 bucks a month next to a Muay Thai studio so you can actually learn how to fight at the same time, too. perfect leveling area for a new entrepreneur. Do that and then remember the most important thing in your life right now is becoming successful and making money. Yes, maybe when you're in your 30s, your 40s, or whatever, you can chill out a little bit and hang out with your kids if that's your goal. You can just chill out and do whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you want, but you're never going to be able to do that unless you master money. And you're going to spend the rest of your life needing money. The rest of your time here, the next 50, 60, 10, 15, I don't care how many years of your life needing this money. And if you are not good at making it, you're going to have a bad time. Period. The end. There's nobody out there that is just terrible at making money that has a comfortable, stress-free life. You need to get to a level of confidence, and it's the most important thing. So, make it the most important thing. Finally, the last thing, and I talk about this in another video on how to go improve this, so you should go watch this video immediately after on how to actually break money down into skills and then learn each of these skills step by step. I even break down the most important skills you should learn if you want to get to a million dollars a year as fast as possible. That's linked below this video. But the last way you need to view money and the thing that's going to make you very successful is viewing money like for example learning guitar or if you're a dork playing World of Warcraft which you know I am. I've gotten very good at it. Excellent tank the world's greatest healer. But I'm not here to brag about that as you know most humble YouTuber. But if you've ever gotten good at anything, getting good at making money is the same exact thing. And it comes down to this basic component which will be explained more in the video below or be linked at the end of this video. So picture this. If you want to get good at guitar and say you've done everything I've talked about already in this video, you're going to associate with good guitar players so you can actually like learn and get really interesting, get all the cultural beliefs. But then what you're going to do is you're going to start trying to play songs. And if you want to get better at guitar, let's say you go and learn how to play Nirvana, and it's a very easy song to play. Obviously, you're not going to get any better at playing guitar or reach any level of town if you just sit around and play that song over and over again. So, you're going to pick harder songs and harder songs and harder songs and try and learn more advanced techniques and you practice that every single day. What a lot of people don't do with money is they don't view it like that. What you need to do is you need to go and practice the basics and that's going to involve losing a little bit of money or spending time without getting results. The most important thing when it comes to learning about making money is to not focus on making money as a result. Focus on growth. For example, if you're playing guitar, you shouldn't hold being able to play a complete song in front of people and get paid for it as your metric of success. Especially when you're starting off, you should hold your metric by watching your finger movements improve and watching your skills improve every single day. If you focus on that, you will eventually get to that point where you're playing guitar in front of people and able to make money and talented enough at it. But that's not a good way to look at it because you're just going to fail for ever and ever and ever and ever if you look at that end result versus feeling success and gratification at the main thing which is the improvement of your skills. Same thing with money. Focus on the core skills which I point out in the video below and will be linked to at the end of this video 100% for free. That's going to help you grow and do that. And so every single day you wake up and say, "I'm going to improve at these skills and I'm going to go and apply them at all costs. I'm going to get these skills no matter if I lose a little bit of money doing it." The most important thing is my skill growth and that I'm better at it today than I was tomorrow. Eventually, you're going to be better at today so much that you start making money. And it's just going to happen. And from then on in your life, it's going to be semi-trivial for you to make a certain amount of money. And as you get better and better, it becomes trivial to make certain amounts of money. For example, back in the day, making a million dollars per year in internet marketing very hard for me. Now, making many million dollars a month is almost trivial for me. I'm trying to make, you know,5 $10 million a month. That's really my my next goal. And making, you know, $100,000 a day or something like that. It's it's something I don't even have to think about doing. It's going to be the same way with any amounts of money. And all I'm doing right now, you have to understand what I just described might seem farfetched to other people. I've just been improving at my skills every single day that I'm at a level of ability that it's not too hard. The momentum and ability that I'm at makes it fairly simple to me. And I'm not putting in much more work than anybody else is. For example, if you see some guy doing landscape in front of a house, he's working muching harder than I am. I just have gone to the point where I'm good enough at playing the game that it going and playing on hard difficulties isn't hard for me. Okay? So, for example, if you ever see like a really good World of Warcraft player playing a dungeon on the highest level difficulty, going back and playing dungeons at difficulty levels that seem impossible to beginners is trivial for them. Same exact thing. Now, the final thing I'm going to give you, the final brainwashing technique you need to look at is the final reason why people don't really pursue anything I talked about is they're afraid of risk. And all you need to understand when it comes to risk is there's all little mental things you can tell yourself. You can go in the mirror and say a high cue to yourself every single morning to give yourself confidence. But what you really want to focus on when it comes to risk is looking at what's actually going to happen in your life if you don't take risk. So if you don't take risk, what most people do, and this is like the most optimal output, okay? Most people don't even succeed at this. You do good in school, you go to college, you get 100K in debt, and then you spend the less your rest of your life grinding out a job that you don't particularly like, and you're not taking risks to like grow in. You're never going to be investing in yourself or anything like that except going back to college and giving more money to the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scam for like a masters or something. Anyways, you're going to spend all your time grinding for that, and you're going to make less money than you want for the rest of your life. and you're not going to be satisfied and you're going to have to be worrying about bills and stressed out by money. That is the guarantee if you don't take risk. To me, that's losing. That's not great. That's not comfortable. I want enough money where I can stop working whenever I want. I want enough money that it comes in passively for me if I know how to build it like that. I want enough money that I have money absolutely handled and it's not an issue in my life and I can buy the things I want. Now, look, you don't need to be buying private jets and giant mansions and all these things to buy be happy. Once you have all your base needs covered effortlessly, that's when you're going to hit peak happiness for money. If you want to go for the extra credit and get the giant houses and the cars and the jets and stuff like that, and you want to beat the highest score of money, great. That's exactly what I'm doing. You don't need to hit happiness, though. Like, I'm not any happier now than when I reached financial freedom like, and that was 13 years ago. That was the best day. That's when I hit peak happiness. So, this isn't about happiness, but you have to understand this right here is a loss. being struggling and strapped down for money your entire life, that's the loss. What you want to understand is that by taking risk over and over while improving your skills, eventually, just like in Vegas, if you bet on a number long enough at the roulette table, you're just going to hit. And so, if you take enough risk while improving your skills, your skills at making money in combination with eventually being in the right place at the right time, which they're both going to tamp them together, the better you get, the better you're going to get at being lucky, and the better you're going to get at maximizing that luck when it happens. Eventually, it will happen and you will hit financial control. And this is inevitable. The only way not to reach this point right here is not taking risk. If you take no risk, you are guaranteed to lose. If you take risk, you're pretty much guaranteed to win if you take risk correctly without losing your money every single time. And over hedging, which I break down below how to make money without risk. I show you how to take appropriate risk in business or with whatever you're doing. If you do this, you are virtually almost guaranteed to eventually hit. I don't know anybody that's taken consistent risk over and over again while consistently growing their skills that hasn't reached some level of financial independence. Most of them are extremely rich today. There are so many dudes, so many dudes I can name that I came up with. I've known Russell Brunson for a very long time. I've known Alex Herozi for a very long time. I know tons of other founders like Sam Evans who owns school now. I think it's worth like a billion dollars or something like that. I know so many other people that I came up with where we were in little forums chatting about making $100 a day, $150 per day. And at this point, the vast majority of them, I can't think of any of them that are not millionaires at this point. And I know so many dudes, not all of them are like Alexozi or Sam Evans or Russell Brunson successful, but I've known so many dudes that have gone from zero to millions of dollars per year that I can't I can't think of any of them that are not making a good good amount of money other than the ones that just purely quit. All right? And that's was in the first couple years. So eventually, from my perspective, you're just going to hit it. And so that's how you need to be viewing risk. The best way to guarantee you lose at life and get that failure that you're trying to avoid in money is not taking risk. So those things right there, if you apply those, that is going to change how you look at the world. The way you're going to make money is through tactics and strategies that you're going to get better at by improving them by breaking them down to skills, which I break down in the videos below and above this video. Go check those out. That's going to come down to hard work and strategic hard work that gives you leverage. Again, explained in all those videos. However, if you don't view the world correctly and you don't have these base understandings I just gave you, you're not going to do those things and you're not going to have confidence behind doing them. So, you have to have this mindset. It's not going to make you rich. It's going to allow you to confidently do the things that will make you rich. So, that's the video.

TITLE: I Made A 3 Page Site That Makes $100k/Day
VIDEO ID: vtb4qlnFaSM
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtb4qlnFaSM
================================================================================

No. Bad viewer. Bad. Bad. Come here. I know what you're thinking. I know you're being skeptical of the title of this video thinking there's no way this guy has a three-page website that's gener $100,000 per day. And that would be reasonable to think if you are on any other channel. But if you're not new here, you know that I bring the red hot sauce. And that's exactly the type of Caliiente peppered pizza I'm about to deliver to you today. I'm going to be showing you straight up, no holds barred. I actually underplayed it. how a simple little website is making me over $100,000 per day. In fact, if you combine all my websites together and all my software companies together, $100,000 a day is actually kind of a bad day. I actually downplayed the clickbait title. And in this video, I'm about to break all YouTube norms. I know when you go to a lot of YouTube channels, someone's talking about making money, how you can be successful in business, and you have no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clue what they do. They never actually show you their businesses. That's because their business is selling you information on how to build a business. But [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that. We don't do that here. In this video, I'm going to show you point blank how I actually make money day in and day out. You're going to see my entire business, everything that goes into it, how I get customers in, what I sell them, how I sell them, everything. And even cooler, because this business actually makes me money, I'm not going to sell you anything. So, put your wallet away. I don't want your money for courses or a mastermind cuz then I have to I have to deal with you. Ew. Frankly, it's just way more attractive to me to keep building what I'm going to show you right here. And the reason why I'm making these videos, I answer the last bit of skepticism you have. I hope that this video helps you go take your business, make a lot of money, and then when you're making a lot of money, you plug Hyro, my software company, into it, you're going to make more money from your business. But until you're making money from your business, I have I have nothing to do with you right now. So, let's dive in. Let me show you what's going on here. So, first things first, let me show you what I'm going to be breaking down here today. And I have one confession. I tricked the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of you. I'm threw you through an alleyoop. I click baited you just a tiny bit. This website is actually more than three pages, but if we break down everything I'm going be showing you here, it's not many more than that. And you can apply the same business model, the same tactic regardless of what website or business that you're doing. Okay? It applies to everything. So, what I'm going to be showing today is I run advertising to create awareness for my software company, which is Hyros, which we'll we'll talk all about here in a second. Now, I'm not here to pitch Hyros at all in this video. Please don't feel pressured to buy it. In fact, if your business isn't making over like $100,000 a month and you don't spend 20 $30,000 a month on ads, at least you have no business even considering hiring. It's it's not for you. Just just put your dick away. It's okay. You don't have to worry about me coming for that thing anytime soon in this video. I don't want it. We are not in the same attractiveness level. So, we're going to focus on how I create awareness with ads. And I send people to my website. Duh. But there's a very specific page on my website's a very specific thing that I send people to. Then I get people to go through a specific funnel, which I'm going to talk about here in a second. And then I have them close to annual or monthly subscriptions to this business. And I repeat this to kingdom come. I just blast the hell out of this thing right here. Put this through. And this easily easily generates usually over $100,000 per day. And if you combine all my companies together and things doing similar kind of schemes to this, it's it's well over that. And I know what you're thinking. Why would you possibly need that much money, Alex? What is the point in having that much cash coming in? It's very, very obvious. I have to correct something that's happened in the past that almost destroyed the Earth. And I need to correct the biggest wrong that's happened in humanity since probably World War II, which was Disney buying Star Wars. I have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] correct this. And the only way I can do this, nobody else is trying, is I can become a multi-billionaire so I can buy this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] back and be like, "No, Han Solo did not get killed by his son. No, Luke Skywalker does not drink tit. No, we do not care about wokeness or political correctness. We care about laser battles and Darth Vader doing cool [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] which you guys have not accomplished in the decades since you bought it. It really angers me and so this is really my character arc right here. Other than that, I don't have any use for this money other than posing next to a Lamborghini in my garage. But that being said, let's get into what we're actually doing here. So, first things first, people are going to view one of these ads right here. Now, look, I don't want to go through this entire ad, the sales copy, everything inside the ad because guess what? I provided all of that for you on this channel in this special mastermind course that I'm just kidding. There's just a YouTube link to it that breaks down my entire ad scripts, all my YouTube ad scripts, all my Facebook ad scripts. They're all literally right below this video. And so instead of walking you through this ad and everything that's going through right here, I'm just going to sum it up very quickly. At my business, Hyros, the really cool thing about it is when business plug it into their ads, they simply make more. So, the way I actually advertise my business, and I think the most effective way to advertise any business, the best ad copy, the best thing you'd ever see on a YouTube channel, is just showing an abundance of results from tons of customers like the person you're trying to bring in. So, in this video right here, I show testimonials from all the really big brands using us. I show all the famous celebrities using Hyros. I show the hundreds and hundreds of normal people using House. And I show endless endless testimonials of people just talking us up and talking about how great we are on Twitter. This right here by far is the best performing ad type that I've ever had because this is what people really care about, especially when it comes to B2B. Now, there are little cool little tricks you can do in e-commerce, like disguising your stuff, like, you know, Squatty Potty, for example. You can make a unicorn take a fantastic rainbow [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and get attention doing that. A lot of people try to make ads like that as the crux of their business. You will occasionally get ads like that, and this is just general ad rant right now for people that want to understand everything that I'm doing right here. But with those type of ads and crazy complex ads, they don't consistently hit. So, you can't bet on them consistently to grow businesses. It's very hit and miss. I prefer making a really great product, getting people to use the product, recording their testimonials, then getting really famous people to use the product based on those testimonials, and then recording their testimonials, and then advertising the ever living hell out of that. And what I want to do with these ads, primarily in my business, just the final ad tip I'll give you, is when you're doing B2B business and stuff, people aren't going to click these ads right away and buy. What they're going to do is they're going to consider your company against a bunch of other competitor companies or their awareness of what's happening. So, when people are thinking about, hey, I can't track my Facebook ads correctly. I want them when they're thinking about that over the next few weeks, they see this ad, it kind of spurs the idea in their head. Over the next few weeks, they're going to go and browse a bunch of tracking companies. I want our company to be top of their head when they're doing that. That's why I hit people over the head with these results all over YouTube, Facebook, Tik Tok. So, this is step one. Now, people will then get linked from this ad to our website, Hyros. Now, based on this ad right here, I'm going to show you something that's super duper effective. So, they can go to our website and they can actually land on the initial tracking pages to talk about tracking and all the things that our software does and all that kind of stuff. I'm sure you've been to a software website, but what I like to do is I like to send people directly to a page that just absolutely smothers and bukkies them in results. So, what I do is they come to this page after hearing about how cool and the results we get. And then they're going to go and skim past the endless results. And this page is intentionally obnoxiously long to create the impression that we have an absolute ridiculous amount of results, which we do. We've been around for a while. We've gained a lot of results uh and cool stuff. So, what I'm doing right here is I'm going to give you a few little tips and things that really push us over the the borderline. Now, again, below this video, my copywriting techniques and how I build my sites, again, right underneath the ad techniques. Everything I'm going to talk about here, the step that you're most interested in, there's a training on this channel for it because I used to make really tight business videos. Nobody watched those because nobody wants realistic tactics. They just want ways that I wave my dick around the internet and magically generate money from my ceiling. But whatever, it's fine. If you guys want the purple crown version of educational content, I'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it. That said, here's tip number one. I love sending people just to endless amounts of results because the first thing and the thing that's going to make people buy something is people believing that it will work. I know that sounds crazy, but a lot of people don't consider it. They send people straight to a page where is like the price of something. And really, when it comes to any product, an e-commerce product, a skincare product, a weightlifting product, a course, a software, anything, the most important thing is people believing it will work. That's the number one thing I want to knock out right away. If they believe it will work, truly truly work, like it's impossible it won't work, then most of the battle's done, then I can actually start selling them and selling on the product. So the big question after is, will it work for me? That's where they're going to get deeper in the website. So that being said, what I'm trying to do right here as well is get them to go and book a demo. Now, one thing I use to get people to book a demo as well, a little bonus thing, is that we guarantee it works. I don't know where your business or product is, but one of the most powerful things I find to get people to buy something is making something so good that you can basically guarantee it's going to work. And you're I'm going to tell you straight up, if you have a business where you can't guarantee results with any level of guaranteedness or consistency, you're going to have a hard time growing. Like if you have a skincare product and it doesn't actually clear up people's blackheads or actually work like most skincare products, they just don't work or they're just overpriced nonsense. What happens is the second someone becomes financially pinched or just doesn't want to like log onto your site because they're lazy, they stop using it. You have to have something that gets people addictive and makes them get results. I know this sounds crazy, but most people don't think about this or focus on this product to the point that they have to come back and keep paying for it. I know if someone comes on and joins high and they put on their ads, they're going to make more money and it's just going to be a no-brainer to keep it going. And so what what I like to do is I show people these result results and then I guarantee the results because I can't keep the money if people that don't get results. Like yes, even if I did and had some crazy refund loopy guarantee like a lot of internet marketers do, what would happen if I did that is eventually people would trash my business online. And then two, people would cancel their subscription. I wouldn't have a long-term business. The key of my business is that the businesses keep paying forever and churn or cancel at a very low rate. And then that subscription billing stacks and stacks on stacks on top of itself. So we didn't get to just 100K a day through ads instantly. What we did is we slowly built up those subscriptions on top of themselves. And so you add $1,000 a day or let's say uh yeah 30,000 a month in subscriptions and people don't cancel. Every single year your income stacks up. That's my favorite business model to use. So then what I'm going to do on these pages, I'm going to push them to a phone call. Okay. Now a lot of times what I also like to do on my websites is I like to think if I can bring this down right here so we can view it is I like to also think about every angle that people are going to be coming through. So you can see when people dig around my website they start looking for and I mean like our website right here. I really consider hires a team effort. It's not just me. Okay. I just know you're watching this channel. So you're thinking it's Alex Becker's business. It's it's all our business. We're all working on this together. That said when I come through here I know that people are going to have specific questions like will it work for me if I'm in e-commerce? will work for me if I'm in SAS. So, for example, I have an entire page breaking down all the specific things and showing companies, large SAS companies, large celebrities and stuff and whatnot and small SAS companies and all the specific features and testimonials that apply just to them. It's very, very important to make sure that if you have different types of customers coming in, you give them different paths because they're going to think once you prove it works, will it work for me? So, finally, what's going to happen right here is they're going to click apply. Now, I don't suggest always doing a callunnel for your businesses. The reason why I do a callunnel for Hyros particularly, and this is so you don't go and copy me and think, well, Alex Becker does it, so everyone should. There's two reasons. The first reason we still do a callunnel at Hyros is because the technical setup of Hyros is pretty complicated and it's one actually one of the biggest problems in the tracking business. You need a little bit of technical knowhow to set up tracking on your business. So, we need to make sure the people get on the phone and are committed to doing that and uh also so they can fit into the business. And then we also charge an upfront payment so that we can get people more invested in it and we can provide the customer support team to back them while they're doing this. It's very intensive at first. So, all in all, when we do this, we actually charge less than most tracking companies do out there, but this is something that we use to make it so that we can almost guarantee that people get results because if they don't set up, they're not going to get results and then they're going to churn. The reason why we do the calls is to make sure they don't churn. That's the reason why we still do them. I'd love to just do a free trial where people just sign up. That's not something you can do in tracking right now. So, the other reason I use this and initially use it early on at Hyros is because when you're running a business, the easiest way to make your ads profitable is to do a callunnel. Why is this? So, when you're doing a callunnel, what's going to be happening with that is you can get the maximum amount out of the customer on the phone up front. Now, what does that mean? Does that mean we didn't extort them and get a ton of money out of them and get them to pay the most upfront? Yes, it it actually does. It depends how you use it. But so, for example, the reason why a lot of course sellers do this is because one that reason. But why does it work so well? If we can look past the the good or bad of of getting as much money out of people as possible. The reason it works for well so well is you can actually listen to someone and design and pitch your proc in the perfect way to them. If they come to your website or they're skimming through or they watch a sales video, what's going to happen is it's not going to be customtailored to them and you're not going to be able to counter their specific objections. When you get them on the phone and you're selling them your product and they're talking to you directly, you can ask them about their business. Ask them what's going on with them and then you can formulate your pitch around what they're doing. So, for example, if an e-commerce business is doing $100,000 per year and they're having trouble seeing their specific Facebook ads, specifically subscriptions, you can say, "Well, look, here's five other 100K a month e-commerce businesses. Here's exactly how this will plug into your subscriptions right here. And for example, if we go look at this ad that you have right here, this ad right here, you're obviously losing money between these two. So, if you plug Hyus in right here, you're going to make that extra 20 30,000 a month from your business just by tracking this correctly based on these ads, looking at the results in your ad manager. Plus, we'll guarantee that that pitch right there is about a thousand times, billion times more effective than someone skimming through my site and seeing the features apply to them. Same exact thing applies to courses. Same thing applies to anything. Now, when you first start a business and you run ads, profit margins really, really, really matter. So, if I'm running an ad on Hyros and I'm doing a free trial and I send people in there, it's going to take us a long time to make our money back on the ad because people don't pay all upfront. If I get people on a phone call and we pitch it effectively enough, we can get people to pay a year upfront. When we get all that money in up front, that covers the ad cost and makes the ad profitable because we're making the max amount per customer and they're paying the year upfront. And so, it allows us to scale our ads and take that money and rotate it back into it. and also have the profit margins to pay customers and invest in the software and grow it faster. A lot of SAS businesses and a lot of businesses die because they're not able to make money or profit fast enough and they can't reinvest in the business. That's why I run call funnels upfront for most businesses when I'm doing it. Also, you get to work with the customers and get to know them one-on-one, which when you first start your first business or you start growing your business, it's extremely important to getting those testimonials. For example, I did all the sales calls and worked with most people on like the first 50 accounts at Hyros. That right there is why we have so many [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] testimonials immediately and we were able to skyrocket because I got a testimonial from every single one of those people. Advertise the hell out of it. That's the strategy and that's why you want to do it. And so then what's going to happen is we're going to get someone on a phone call. They're going to go through the pitch which is also provided below this video. I literally walked through our entire sales pitch. Everything that's going through there, you can go through there below. It's all linked video breaking down everything and do. And that's how I go and build this business. I broke down every step of the business to you. the ads, the initial landing pages, my thoughts on the landing pages, the funnel that we're using, and if you want to see the pitch and all the tactics that go into the pitch and actually selling the product, that's right below the video. And so, one of the reasons why I wanted to show you this, and I really kind of peppered down the the entertainment value initially, is because I want you to see that businesses that make a lot a lot of money, they're not really that crazy. I'm not doing anything or reinventing the wheel at all. If you can see my ads, they're not that creative. I I know you've seen some really creative ads out there and you've seen some creative companies. You think maybe you have to go make something super special. My ads are literally me skimming Twitter sometimes. That's what works best. I've tried the creative ads. We have high quality ones. We have film teams coming in and we do that and I do run those ads from time to time. But the ads that work every single time. It's just me reading our [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] testimonials on Twitter. Lesson one. Next lesson. You can see how I have a very different website than other SAS companies. It's really a small website and it micro focuses on exactly what the person's looking for. primarily convincing them that it does work and then taking them down a route afterwards that shows them it will work for them. Next, we go and put them in a call funnel, which is nothing unique. Every single [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on planet Earth runs these. It's you can see they're diamond dozen. And what we do is we get people on that call. And you can see the reason why we do that is one because of the things I talked about and also the setup for high-risisk. But if you're starting a business, those profit margins and everything I talked about, that's what works best when you're starting a business. On top of that, it leads to us being able to get the customer commit and churn less, which is essential if you're building a subscription business, which is my favorite business to build. So, finally, now you understand and you see everything I've done there. There's absolutely nothing I did there that's unique or creative or marketing genius. It is it is actually almost cookie cutter basic fundamentals. It is the foundation of marketing and just getting people in. And I want you to again see one of the big focuses I have right there is guaranteeing the results and getting results for customers and making sure they don't leave. All of this is business basic fundamentals put into a software company. That's it. And I want to stress to you why I showed you this. You think 100k a day business or 200k 500k b day business has to look crazy. And if you look actually at the back end and how we actually deliver our customer support and how we work with customers and manage the company, that's a little crazy. But the marketing and the money-making part of it, it's not that hard to understand. It's not that crazy. So, that being said, go check out all the videos below this video about the part that you're most interested in. The ads, the sales videos, the copywriting, the sales calls, even are all right there. That's it. I told you I'd show you. There you go.

================================================================================

Dude, the feminist, they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] won. Looking at these stats right here, if you're a man in America who wants to be successful, which I assume you are because you're watching these videos, it's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're screwed, man. And I'm sure you're somewhat aware of this. It's why you're probably pessimistic and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all the time, which is why you see the title of this video, how to beat 99% of men, and you're super skeptical that in the next 13 minutes, I can show you how to do that. And frankly, I get why you think like that when we go through these stats and these metrics right here that's happened. It's bad. And I know what you're thinking. And this douchebag in front of Lamborghini probably just wants to sell me some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] No, I'm already [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm not going to sell you anything. And by all metrics, I've beat a 99% of men. I'm very rich. I bet the nine figure net worth in my early 30s. I've had a six-pack for a decade now. And I'm also happily married to an attractive woman who is nice to me. So, by all tangible metrics, I've beaten 99% of men. So, you better trust me. Six ways to your mom's chocolate milk cookies that Yeah, I can tell you how to do it. And it really comes down to one thing I'm going to show you in this video. And it's the one thing all these dudes that are suffering from these stats I'm about to go through are lacking. So [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] pay attention for 10 minutes, please. Because what's happening to these guys, what's going to happen to you is dark. Look at these stats. This is ridiculous. I just went to chat GBT and said, "Chat GBT, how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are men in America?" I didn't actually ask that. It gave me a completely different picture. Got some really interesting links on that. I'm not going to say I didn't explore them, but that's off topic. So, we're not going to That's a totally other video. That's a very sexy video that we're gonna have in the future when I have more followers and you can unsubscribe. But looking at this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like right now, what is going on with you guys? And again, I have to solution to this, but let me let's judge and and laugh at men in America right now. One in three men under 30 haven't had sex in a year or ever. In 2008, 8% of men 18 to 24 were virgins. By 2018, the number has doubled to 27%. I guarantee now it's in like the 35% 40%. And among men 18 to 30, over 25% say they've never been in a serious relationship. But wait, wait, it gets dark, man. You guys just aren't not getting laid. Men under 40 are two to three times more likely to be addicted to porn, gaming, and substances. So, for the many of my followers, look guys, I love you all the same. I know you're 5'2 neck beards. I know hentai catg girls and sitting in your room smoking pot while rubbing butter on your belly is really your favorite thing to do. But come on, guys. We got to get it together. Heck, just looking at this right here, one in three men aged 25 to 34 live with their parents. And over four out of 10 men in the US is morbidly obese. One in three men, one in three men 18 to 39 are obese. And of all you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on dating apps, women are swiping right, which is accepting you 5% of the time. Look, I get why it's dark, man. After reading all that, I get why you guys are a little bit pessimistic these days. I get why you're a little bit edgy and why you're upset all the time because it clearly looks like the world is against you. And when you look at everything on the news, they hate men. When you look at women right now, they've changed and they hate men. Everywhere I go on my newsfeed right now, I'm just going to put a little newsfeed of mine on here. It is the war against men. The loneliness epidemic of men. Men are making less money than ever. It's harder to make money and make your way in the world than ever. the entire Democratic party has made it their mission to either me to you, make sure you're poor or make you feel bad for using the wrong pronouns or punish you for not being by. And so when you look at this total summary of everything that's happening to dudes right now and the effects of it, man, the world is is really bad for dudes right now. There is literally a war against men and uh they they're winning. And in this video, I'm going to fix all that. I'm going to fix it all actually in the next 10 seconds. But then I'm going to fix it, give you the thing to focus on. Just one thing. It's just one thing. It's one little thing and then I'm going to show you a few paths that you can do, things you need to do now if you're in your 30s or definitely extremely like immediately if you're in your 20s that will fix all of it. It will fix it all. You'll be fine. So, here's number one. Here's the big one. All right. Get get out your notebook over here. Write out your notebook. Get a Sharpie. It's going to be very big. You're only going to need to write one thing. Here it is. Who gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Point number one. I'm going to give you a few simple things you will do that if you do, I promise you, you will beat 99% of men. Hands down. Easy. it won't be a problem. I'll even link you to videos right after this that are going to enable you to get rich. And I won't even sell you a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] course or some mastermind or some Discord group where I try to teach you how to be a man. I'm not going to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do that. I'm just going to fix it all in one video. And I'll show you to make money without selling a course either. I'll fix it all in couple videos. If your short Gen Z millennial brain can avoid the Tik Tok syndrome of clicking away here for a couple minutes, here's the thing you need to keep in mind. Who gives a point one as a man? It is. There's never been a time in society where your job was to sit around and care and take care of other men. Maybe when you get to some point of giant wealth or something like that like I'm doing now and helping you, but who the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cares what the world is doing? There is an endless amount of men making [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tons of money right now. I made [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tons of money already this year and there's absolutely nothing stopping you from doing that. Yeah, the whole entire world is throwing men down a bus and a lot of men are succumbing to the negativity that's being thrown at them. Does that mean you have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it? And does it mean the negativity is even that hard to deal with? Let me let me break one thing down for you right here. If you compare this time of being a man compared to any other time in society's history, it's technically easier than ever. Look, I know the 70s to the 2005s or whatever, it was [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome to be a man. Cuz not only were women out of the workforce, so you made all the money. There was no internet so you couldn't get metoed. There was no social media so you weren't having to compete against good-looking guys with six-pack women. They really only know the the immediate 150 200 dudes within their vicinity. Okay? So, if you were like the one dude that was like a seven or something, you were doing pretty well. Now, a seven is basically a two. If you go on Instagram, every girl is like, "Why don't why don't Zack Efron looks like this? Why don't you? Zack Efron has a million dollars. Why don't you?" So, yeah, it's it's the comparison and everything. It's it is pretty hard right now compared to like the ' 80s or 70s, but you go back maybe like 40 in the 40s or something like that. They were literally grabbing you and putting you on ships and sending you off to war. Like in the 50s or 70s, literally the average experience for a 20-year-old was you get kidnapped by the government and have to go to the jungle to fight in a mortal combat fight to the death against a bunch of angry Vietnamese people climbing in tunnels whose life goal was to light you on fire. Like, it's not that bad, first off, but secondly, just cuz 99% of other dudes are having a bad time, it doesn't mean you have to have a bad time. Look, I'm going to tell you something straight up. I made a ton of money this year. Since the age of 30, I've had a six-pack. When I was 20 years old, I was very, very bad at talking to women. I was an incredibly awkward [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] As you can see, I've totally become well adjusted in this day and age. If you look at Yeah, this is this is peak emotional maturity and stability right here. But ignore the fact I was bad at talking to women. I managed to fix that. I was in fact just a basket case. I was depressed all the time, drinking, watching the tits on the inner tube, smoking pot, doing all the things. And now I I don't. And I'm going to tell you what, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Joe Biden, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the woke the the woke cult, a bunch of purple-haired women, the the women from the view, they they didn't show up on my doorstep and stop me. Nothing. No one showed up to stop me. And so, the bigger point I have to I have to get into right now before all this as I scroll through my YouTube newsfeed constantly. constantly reading Charlie Kirk or whatever his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] name is telling me how hard it is to be a man and seeing Andrew Tate and all the other people and everybody in their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dog out there and all the ma fitness influencers and male uh alpha male influence telling me, "Oh, it's so hard being in war on men so dark right now. Women suck right now." Blah blah blah. Women have always sucked. When was when was there a time when there wasn't a bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] dudes who were not doing well in life that were mad that they weren't getting laid? Like women have never been nice to dudes first off. There was never like a time where you were in a bar like I I went up and I I lived back in the day where you'd have to approach women at bars. Trust me, they weren't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] nice. If you were a short little 5'2 neck beard and you went approaching women at the bars with your little funky haircut, want to show them your Pokemon cards and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that, they weren't nice then either. Okay, there's a point where frumpy little dudes had a good time. So, get get that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of your mind. I'm sorry that women are going on Only Fans now and showing their butts for millions of dollars. The thing that you need to come back to as I as I before I get on any of these rants right here is it doesn't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matter if it's hard. There is nothing stopping you from being that 1% of man that gets all the things that everybody's talking about that they can't get anymore. There's nothing stopping you. Yes, 99 other dudes are having a bad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] time. Why do you? There is nothing stopping you from making good amounts of money. There's nothing stopping you from getting a six-pack and being good-looking and taking care of yourself. I know the average view on this channel has a height of about 411, but other than that, I mean, you you there are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] girls out there for you. You'll be fine. You go into your little Hobbit gym, my little 4 foot1 followers, you can lift some weights, get jacked, you'll be fine. You still won't be able to reach the top shelf at the grocery store, but that's fine. You just don't just don't go to the grocery store with women. You got Whole Foods people to go shopping for you right now. They'll grab the top shelf for you. Just go hire some tall 6'7 Amazonian woman to go do your shopping. Heck, you could just go marry a tall Amazonian woman. She'll get all the top stuff. You won't even need to use those stools or ladders. Okay, I'm done with this rant. There's nothing stopping you from taking care of yourself when you're looking. There's nothing stopping you from being incredibly remarkably strong and not playing video games or smoking pot or drinking or watching pornography 24. There's nothing stopping you. And so what I see all these men doing out there is they watch all these videos and they're just like, "Well, I guess I'll just be an insult now. Like the world's so mean to me. It's so tough out there. All the women on the view keep saying I'm bad. I guess they'll justing ruin my life." Like that's what I'm seeing guys doing. And you just have to simply not submit. I don't care if it's hard. I don't care if most people are failing. Just don't be the one that fails. All it takes is it's not easy. It's not easy. But you just have to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] consistent. Pick where you want to go in life. Pick the things that you don't want to have problems with or you don't want to suffer from and then fix them. I'm going to give you some really good [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] starting points right here. So look, as a man right here, there are things that are going to control your results in life more than anything else. It's your ability to make money. It's ability to control your health. It's your ability to be mentally strong and it's going to be your ability to probably interact with women. So, here's lesson number one on all these four things is you need to take the mind if you're a man right now. Every single one of these four things is adjustable. For some reason, I almost everyone I knew growing up, everyone I know now still believes this. Everybody, most men seem to believe that all these things are just set in stone. Like you either are born with the ability to make money, talk to women, be in shape, be decent looking, and handle your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Okay? They feel like your personality, everything's just ingrained into it. So, when I was growing up and I was in my 20s or whatever, no one I knew was trying to figure out how to make more money. No one I knew was trying to improve at talking to women. No one I knew that was trying to really improve their body shape or whatever. They're just like, "Oh, 22, this is basically what I look like." If you look at me in my 20s versus how I look now, no, you're not. It's not just basically what you look like. Every aspect of yourself outside your atrociously, atrocious shortness is completely augmentable. You can change all of it. And so the first thing you need to realize is you can just change all this just like a character in a video game. There's almost nothing you can't change, especially if you're still young. And so you have no excuse for just being like, hm, all right, so all I have to do is move these meters over here and then I'll be above the 99% of men and all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that they're dealing with that looks like a bad time. I mean, sitting in my house smoking pot, jerking off to dudes, pretending to be girls on only fans, that seems dark. I don't want to be there. So I'm going to adjust these meters right here. And then all you have to do is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it. So, here's where you start with any of these things. Let's talk about money. Are you going to be as rich as me? Well, look, I'm 37. It took me like 15 years, a long ass time to get to the large net worth I have now. That's really slow. I see so many 20-year-olds doing it so much faster. I I'm I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot. I'm really not that good compared to most 20-year-olds I seeing today. I'm seeing so many 20-year-olds building better, smarter, faster businesses than I did when I was 20. I mean, my first businesses, Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Batman. That was some dark [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] But I'm seeing kids putting together SAS businesses and getting to an $80 million valuation in their second week now. All right. So, are you going to get as rich as me? Maybe. I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You should give it a shot. I did it. But the thing you need to realize is even if you're not trying to get worth multiple nine figures or hundreds of millions of dollars. You can still learn valuable skills. You learn those valuable skills and then you sell them to businesses or you do them for businesses as a job. You can make tons of money as an employee. By the way, by the way, I have employees at my company who joined Hyros who started off as like the COO, for example. They worked their way up originally to CEO, then they got equity in my company. Uh there's people at my company right now that have almost an eight figureure net worth just from working for me. So, you can do it as an employee. You just have to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good at what you do. So, the first thing you need to think about when it comes to money is a I can get rich or make a lot of money at least compared to most people. And then realize the way to do that is you take your trade [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] seriously. I know this sounds like such basic advice, but there's so many people out there that don't look at their trade and say, "hm, what are the skill sets that go into being able to charge a lot for my job?" For example, Facebook just went and offered someone $100 million to come program their AI. What did that person do? He's an employee. He's getting paid hundreds of million dollars because he went and learned a valuable skill set that a business needs. So, what you want to learn if you're an employee or a person selling to businesses is what do businesses need? What do people who are making money need? And how can I create something that gives them value that makes them more money or saves them money? and then learn how to do that really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well. That's it. Like even if you're employee or you make a business, they're both the same thing. What do I do at high-risisk my software company? I looked at what businesses were doing running ads and I thought, how can we make them more money? How can we give them value? And then how can I build teams, build software, and do all those things? So, I figured out a bunch of things to do that, but it's all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] augmentable. And it started literally when I first got in the business, I said, what do businesses need? They need more customers. What's one way I could do that? SEO. There's a plethora of different ways. I followed that path. I use that to also land jobs doing SEOs for companies that I worked at. Just realize that you can poke the matrix back. That's the most important thing I got to say because when I was 20 years old, I thought, hm, I don't where the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] does money come from? Why do people make money? Why do people get paid a lot of their jobs? I didn't know. And I didn't think it was augment. I wasn't going to college or anything like that. So, I was like, ah, cuz I just can't make money. Nothing's further than the truth. You are completely in control of how much money you make. You just have to learn skills that make people money or give value to people and then master those. and work very very hard them just like playing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] World of Warcraft for 40 hours a day. If you approach it like that, you're going to win. Next, your health. How you look, everything that goes in that. And yes, your health applies to how you look. I'm not going to be talking so much about like personal health in terms of like your organs and how long you live. That's extremely important, but that's probably not bogging you down right now. I'm talking about your actual physical health. Look, if you're a dude outside of how short you are, there is nothing stopping you from understanding how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] food works, getting a basic skincare routine, making some money to fix your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] teeth. If you got jacked up, jaggled tooth, get some [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] braces. Trust me, I know it sucks. My parents literally waited till the last year of high school to put me in braces. That was a fun last year. Fix your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] teeth. Learn some basic grooming. And then learn how to get a six-pack and put on muscles on your body. Learn how to eat protein and do these things. I wasn't necessarily good at any of these things when I first got started. I looked like a foot when I was in my 20s because I chronically drank and smoked pot and ate pizza for every single meal. There's nothing stopping you from learning these things. So, sit down and make a goal to absolutely learn how food works, what goes in your body and learn how to work out with aggression. I'm not saying you have to be some bodybuilder taking steroids or anything like that, but there is no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] reason you shouldn't have a six-pack. I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] What are you doing with your time? Why do you have to eat cupcakes or whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're doing that's stopping you from getting it? Why don't you Why don't you have some semblance of muscles? Why are you not lean? It's all controllable factors. These are all by your choice. Are the hot pockets and Chipotle burritos more important than what's going to control your results in life, which is your appearance. People are going to treat you differently. Women are going to treat you differently and you're going to feel better and feel more confident and you're not going to suck like 99% of men if you just go and handle this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right here. Finally, your mental well-being and fortitude. Stop trying to avoid hard things in life. That's the only thing you have to do. What you need to do at 20, you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who are living with your parents, like, what are you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] doing? The reason why so many men are suffering right now is because they're allowed to be little baby ass [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] When I was 18 and I was barely past high school, my dad was like, "Well, I'll see you later." And I joined the military and I learned how to be a man after that. I learned how to handle my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and get together, which is what most men don't get the chance to do. They either go to college and their parents pay for it. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Or they stay in their parents house and like work from there and like don't go out and move out and like go see the world and stuff. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Or they sit around and they find some other reason tooodle around and not take on life's challenges. When you are 18 years old, you better have your suitcase [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] packed. Move out of your parents house, but it's expensive. Go bunk up with four other dudes who feel the same exact way. But I need to go to like college and have experience. No, you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] don't. Just go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] find go move to college town. I guarantee there's three, four dudes. They're all broke, too. And you could just go split a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] apartment or a few bedroom apartment. When I was in my 20s and I got out of the military, I just went and lived with buddies who were in college. And I had just a tiny little one-bedroom in this house, like this tiny little closet bedroom. And it was very, very cheap. Any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] can afford that. I was working as a bartender/barback and then eventually doing little side gigs online for SEO. I wasn't making a lot of money. So, what you need to do immediately if you're young, get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of your parents house and just go out there and just throw yourself in the world and live broke. It's fine. It's fine. And what's going to teach you is how to handle your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and grow. That's going to make you mentally strong. I'd also encourage you to go and start learning how to fight. One of my biggest regrets is not going and doing more Muay Thai or jiu-jitsu when I was younger. In fact, I did none of it cuz I was a giant baby back [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I only started doing tons of it when I got older. But that's just going to help you another layer of confidence and mental fortitude. and then go actively pursue learning and not putting up with your stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] emotions. Those emotions in your head and the things that's telling you to cry or think or feel an ego or some emotional response to all these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] videos telling you your life's over as a dude on internet. Just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ignore them and learn how to ignore them. Just get really good at ignoring those things. It doesn't matter. It's irrelevant. Those thoughts are not you. They have nothing to do with you. Like you can literally just sit here and watch your thoughts and all these stupiding things your brain produces. You can watch it like a television show. So that's obviously not you cuz you're watching it. So, not getting into that deep part right there, but master your damn mind and throw yourself into challenges. The reason why so many men are suffering is because they need to be challenged. You need to go and challenge yourself. When it comes to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] porn, video games, smoking, doing all stuff, just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stop doing it. I don't know what to tell you. Like, you know this is going to make your life so much worse, yet you keep doing it. I know it's tough. I've had to get off marijuana at 1.2. Marijuana. I think that's how the the grown-ups say it now. I sound old, but I had to stop doing that stuff at one point, too. Yeah, you can't sleep for a little bit. It's annoying. And yeah, not drinking every weekend while your boys are at the bar getting drunk and you're at home working. Yeah, it's kind of hard. And not playing video games. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's kind of depressing not being able to play Fortnite with your boys. But guess what? You get to be rich and have everything else you ever wanted in life. So, it kind of pays off. Just don't do these things. I'm not going to make a whole video on stopping these things right now. I have a video on not drinking that I'll give you later in this video that applies all those things in video games and whatnot. Then finally, women. So many guys are down and out cuz women suck now. I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] care if every girl is becoming a porn star right now and is mean and wants to date a tall millionaire. Why don't you just go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] be a tall Well, most of you guys can't do it. Why don't you just go be a jacked millionaire? I see all these videos like, "Oh, all the men think they want to all the women want to date just Chads now and they they see all these movie stars on Instagram and social media is a thing. bunch of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chess who are mad that they have to compete in the genetic arena of dating and sex. I'm sorry that women's expectations are too high these days. And I'm sorry women are crazy. They've always been [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] crazy. Like, thank you, internet, for discovering that women say all sorts of crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and do crazy things. And now dudes are like, "Well, girls are just either [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] these days or they want they want too high status of men, so I'm just going to sit in my house and be an incel." Okay, great. your competition if you're a dude is even lower than it was before when I had to go do it. Like back in the day, I had to go to bars and actually walk up to women and talk to them. But guess what? Guess what? Out of when I would go to bars or I go out to meet women, there'd be 100 other dudes at the bar. I was the only one walking up and approaching girls and like trying to get good at talking to them. So, the first thing I'm going to tell you is that one, your ability to interact with women is just like everything else I talked about. You could just improve that. Now, I don't think I'm the world's best game player out there, the best spitter of game. I'm no [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Ryan Gosling, but you can get to the point where your interactions with most women are going to go pretty well. And then I see everybody complaining, oh, they want they want some millionaire with a six-pack. Why don't you just go be a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] millionaire with a six-pack? Then all you have to do is just not eat potato chips, do crunches every single day, and then pick a craft and work on it and avoid video games, porn, and drinking, whatever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] other weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're doing. Like, you can do it. If if if that's your concern that women's bars are too high, yes, that sucks for the other 99% of dudes out there. It really does. You can't be some fat chad and expect to trick girls into dating you anymore. It sucks. I know. But for you, you don't have to be in that. You could just be the one the one that people pursue. Now, I'm not saying I'm the master of game or women or anything like that. I am telling you that if you focus on yourself and improving yourself, if you become mentally strong, you get yourself in shape, you make some money, you're going to be a top-of-the-line guy. And while I'm not saying every girl and their pack of sority sisters is going to want to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you, you're going to probably have a pretty decent ratio. an experience with women and you're probably not going to hate all of them because the experience will usually be positive because you're actually providing value which is what everyone's looking for in a relationship. The women's seeking value, you're seeking value, too. Instead of saying, "Well, I suck ass. Why does no one want to date me? Cuz you suck ass." And the solution all this too and all this this Gooner stuff and incel stuff, just go work on yourself. And then when you've reached the point where you're a top tier dude, if you're still awkward around women, everything cuz God forbid I was just terrible at it, just go practice. Just go practice. Go out, walk up to a girl, talk to her. Going to go terrible. She's going to think you're there to collect her hair and sniff her or something, which you probably are. I know you guys watching this channel, but it's fine. She'll reject you. Then just go do it again. And just just go do it again. Just go do it again. And then go on dates. Just when you trick them to go on the dates with you, just just go on more dates. And eventually, you'll just get comfortable and you'll realize the flow of the conversation, how it goes. And then she'll be like, "Wow, he does kind of well in life. Wow, he's not an emotional child. Wow, he like actually goes to the gym and doesn't have snaggle teeth and like washes his [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] face. And wow, he's like doing interesting things in his life. He's interesting. And guess what? Most of your interactions with women at that point when you have a decent socially passable personality and you have things going for you are going to be positive because you are going from being a commodity to rare. It's none of this is that hard. None of this is that hard. And I think the main thing that is really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up dudes right now is they go through these endless doomer posts and these videos from dudes telling you all women are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now. It's impossible to make money. The government hates you. The animals are leaving. All the men out there are suffering and and you you are going to suffer too and the world's just rigged against you. And they think in and every dude is thinking it's so hard right now. It's not. No one's even coming and trying to ship you off to fight a bunch of angry Asians in the woods. Your life is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fine. You just need to go and address the things I talked about head on. these these are just problems with long-term consequences that that all you need to do is overcome some short-term pain to get through and that's it. It's all going to be fine. So, in conclusion, yes, 99% of men are going down the drain. It's a war on dudes. Yes, there is clearly something really nasty going on the world that wants men to suffer and everything. And I don't think Andrew Tate is wrong. I don't think all these guys on the internet are technically wrong. What I think they're they're not helping is just this endless cultural shift of men deciding it's better to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about it instead of just put it in an itemized checklist and deal with it one at a time. Other than the fact that you're a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everything else is just completely up to you. It's completely up to you. And for the two people watching this video who got hit by a meteorite as a kid and you're like you're deformed and you look like you look like Dobby from Harry Potter, like I don't know. I can't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] help you. But for the 99% of dudes that are watching this video that everything in life is like mostly normal, you're fine. Just go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] handle it. Write the list. Take it out. Checklist one at a time. You got it. You're going to be fine. Now, if you want to learn how to make money and whatnot, here's a video on how to get started to make your first 100,000 million bucks a year. Probably a good place to start. And um if you want to stop drinking and doing stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I've linked them in the description. Okay, bye.

TITLE: How to Get Richer Than 99.8% of People

================================================================================

So, I know what you're thinking as you read that title. There's no way this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] as good-looking as he is, could explain one concept in 13 minutes that is going to make me millions of dollars and rich for the rest of my life. You're wrong. I'm about to exactly do all that. And I'm not even going to sell you a course like 99.9% of everyone else on YouTube. I'm already [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich. I don't need your money. It's okay. I'm actually just pissed now that you're doubting me. Which is why I'm going to explain this one concept to you that if you get you will realize making money is not about hard work or any of the high coup [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you see in the sidebar right now about figuring out your mind or whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the people on the internet are telling you these days. You just have to do this one thing and optimize your life around it and it will be virtually almost impossible for you not to get rich. It will be like going to Vegas and playing 100 rounds of roulette and betting red and losing every single time. It's just not going to happen. You're going to hit. And the only thing separating you from a life of a lot of money, which you want since I assume you're here, and a life of no money or less money than you want, maybe you're a business owner, you're already making some good money. The only thing separating you from that is listening to me for the next 10 minutes. Okay, you good? Let's begin. So, the thing that people misunderstand about money is they think it comes down to hard work or skills or I don't know, whatever. You go to a business event, you'll see people on stage talking about all sorts of wahoo stuff about how to go out there and be successful, get good at hiring, get good at building software, get good aware. No, it's it doesn't come down to any of that. What making money comes down to is truly just understanding how to take risk, manage risk. I'm just going to put an M here because I'm not going to rattle this out. You won't be able to read it anyways. My handwriting style is is that of a fresh pressed [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So, this is really just for me to help me think. So, bear with it. And then making decisions about said risk. This is this is it. If you were actually extremely good at this and know how to efficiently do these things, you don't even have to work. Let me explain. Let's say you bought Bitcoin at $1, you can make billions of dollars. You wouldn't have to work a day in your life. If you bought Apple when it originally launched and you were able to take a risk with that with a h 100,000 whatever dollars, you put a million dollars in there, then by now you'd be a billionaire. You'd never have to work a day in your life. Making money has nothing to do at all with hard work or the skills you have as an entrepreneur. This is the first course understanding of making money that you have to have. And the reason why so many people are so bad at making money is because they one refuse to take risk and then they get very bad at managing risk and in making decisions around risk. If you are super [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good at this, you don't have to do any work whatsoever. You just have to sit around make decisions about risk all day. Which is why Warren Buffett is so damn rich. The guy doesn't work, doesn't run any companies. He just invests and takes very smart risk every single day. It's the epidome of the core of making money. Now, let me explain this to you in a way that will actually make you rich now that you understand this. See, what most people try to do is they try to make money their entire life while not taking risk. They go to college, no risk. They just get in debt, which is risk of its own, a very stupid risk, but it's not it's not a risk from their perspective. They try to go and save money. They try to work a job and not get fired. They try to build businesses. Even if you're a business owner right now, do you want to know the reason you're not making as much money as you want? don't take any [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] risk. You try to outwork. You try to outthink. You try to outrun. Do everything you possibly can to avoid this one thing, risk. And so, the reason why most people stay poor and most entrepreneurs never get the levels they want to get to is they avoid risk at all cost. And what risk truly is is actually the misvaluing of an asset. And what risk truly is is the chance of misvaluing an asset. But the better way to look at risk is entering a situation where the outcome of an asset's value is unknown. It could be $1,000. It could be 50. And if you buy at a higher price or a lower price, it's going to affect your outcome. So, for example, if you buy something for $60 and it ends up being worth $1,000, you make a lot of money. If it ends up being worth 50 cents, you lose a lot of money. Uncertainty. And so, what people are actually trying to avoid is uncertainty, not so much risk, but they're interchangeable words, so we'll use the word risk. So, h how does this make sense? So, let me put this in perspective for you so you really, really see this. So, for example, I work about the same amount of hours as a plumber would. Okay? I worked sometimes 8 to 10 hours a day, sometimes recently, sometimes I only work four hours a day. Regardless, we'll put in when I was starting my business, we put in the I put in the same amount of hours that a plumber did. Why do I have a net worth that's worth hundreds of millions? And why does the plumber not? It's because my net worth involves massive amounts of risk and putting my time and energy into things that might not pay off. and then more so putting money, lots of money behind things than eventually once I had access to money that might not pay off and were valued extremely low at one point. Really think about that real quick. How did I achieve a 9 figureure net worth from my software companies? Let's not even involve my crypto and all the other weird bonkers [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I do just software. It's because I obtained control of my companies at when they were worthless and then I invested my time and energy into something that might have turned out worthless and then I invested lots of money into something that again might have turned out worthless. And so if you really look at the difference between me and a plumber, it's not because I decided to build a software company per se. It's not because I outworked him or did some different type of work that was her. I mean, if you ever seen a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] plumber do work, have you ever seen people do lawn care? That's hard [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] work. I sit at this computer all day and send little private messages to my staff like a 15-year-old girl and and make millions and millions of dollars a month. I I I do not work hard compared to them. So really the secret to my success right here is not the fact that I outworked them. It's the fact that I took risk and applied work or invested work in risky assets that were low value and then later on became worth massive value. Well, they took no risk. They showed up on a job and they worked very hard, but there was no risk behind them showing up and fixing a toilet. This is the same thing you look at with employees. This is the same thing you look at with most entrepreneurs. They do stuff they know is going to work. They don't take risk with their time, money, and thoughts. So again, if we go back to it, let's say when I was forming hyros originally, let's say I just hired one of me, a person who's smart as me, and I just sat in the background and told them the type of company I need to build. And let's assume they did all the work. There's lots of people who do that exact situation. I could have built high-risisk without ever working a single hour. Why? Because then I would take even more risk by hiring someone, paying them, and then just telling them what to do. Or maybe not even telling them what to do. I just find someone with a good idea and I invest in them and then I'd make the many millions of dollars I have now. That's exactly what other people do as well. So, you can see the core to all this never comes down to hard work or effort. It comes down to accurately being able to judge and manipulate risk to obtain assets for far far far less than they're worth. Whether the way to obtain the asset is by obtaining it early when it's first made like a company or by being misjudged in its value. And then the other flip side of that is manipulating the asset via work or your own influence to adjust the risk. And so again, we go back to this again. You have to really understand this. The reason why some people get extremely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich and most people don't is they know how to deal with risk. If you want to find people and you want to see why they're not getting the money they want in their life, it's because they don't take any risk. And the thing is, the more risk you take, the better you get at judging risk. For example, when I was first starting software companies, I was very bad at judging risk. I couldn't judge people. I couldn't judge what I was doing. I didn't know how to invest the money. I didn't know how to move the money around. It just didn't work out very well. But as I've taken more risk over the years, as I've done a lot of risky things in crypto, as I've invested in more companies, as I've built more companies, as I've hired more people, as I've started more teams, I've gotten much much better at analyzing the risk. It's sometimes now I'm able to start companies where I don't work at them at all. I tell the CEO what to do. I tell him how to direct the teams. I find him the people and they do all the work. But again, I'm the one moving the money behind it and obtaining the asset at a very low value to manage the risk. And so really what we want to do if we want to get rich, if you want to get rich, the only thing you really need to optimize your entire life for is the ability to take and learn and get good at taking risk. So what does this look like? So people misunderstand risk when they think about it. They think it means starting a company. They think it means investing in Bitcoin or something like that. Risk comes in many forms. You have two assets. You have your time, of course, work, energy. Energy you put into work, which is kind of like time, but kind of different. So, we'll just keep it right there. You have your money. Okay. Most people don't risk any of these. They go into a job that's low risk. They put their work energy and all their work thoughts, all their high-powered thoughts and thinking behind that job or or a company or whatever where there's no risk and they don't really take risk with their money at all. Same thing applies to entrepreneurs. They go and start a business that is very low risk. For example, I had many info businesses out there. You see a lot of people starting info businesses and selling you courses on YouTube. You want to know why they do that? Because there's no barrier to entry. There's no risk. they can you you can start up a course and start selling it tomorrow. It's a fantastic business model if you don't want to take risks, which is why many people don't get rich selling courses, at least not what they want to be. If you see a lot of course sellers, they always cap out at about five million bucks a year or somewhere around there. If you want to w know why Alexi makes so much damn money right now is he took the influencer model and then applied more risk to it by actually acquiring businesses that then approach him and in growing those businesses obtain the asset for lower value and then blowing up the value of the business. And so we applied massive risk to the course seller model by not selling courses and instead selling something else which was the ability for him to buy businesses blew it up. So, like I said though, most people never get good at taking risk cuz they never take any risk. And so, most people spend their entire life avoiding the thing that generates all the money, which is why they're so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] poor. And our goal here is not to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] poor. It's it's to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich. So, we can't be doing that. Don't don't be a silly goose. So, what we want to do from a young age is we want to be able to allow ourselves to take as much risk as possible with our time, our work thoughts, and eventually our money. Now, here's how you do this. Here's how you do this. This is where it all comes together. If you just do this over and over again for your entire life, you're going to be very rich. When you're 20, when you're broke, when you're whatever, when you're working a job, what you must first do is you must allow yourself maximum time to invest in risk. Now, what I mean by time to invest in risk, this means investing your time and energy into doing things that are risky, which is learning skills and trying things to make money that might not pay off. For example, if you're 17 years old and you spend two years learning code and learning to code video games, that's a massive risk. you just spent two years on that, but you walk away with the skill that allows you to produce income. That being said, that's not that high of a risk because plenty of people know code these days. If you had done that back in like, let's say, I don't know, 1995, you'd be a very rich person if you kept on going down that path and then applied more risk to it, which is starting a software company, launching your own software, selling your own software. So, how do we do this? Well, when you're 20 years old, I don't know how you're gonna go and generate money. I don't really care. But let's say 20, 30, 50, whatever. Let's say you just got a job. You have some ability to make money. You need to get your lifestyle cost as low as humanly possible. I don't care. Move to Wyoming. Get a studio apartment that's 300 bucks a month. There's stuff like this that exists. Get a share a a a two-bedroom unit. I don't know with some other dude. There's plenty of ways to live completely broke as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] And so what you want to do is you want to find and reduce your life cost to absolutely nothing. Find or move somewhere where you are living right next to a grocery store or a gym because all you need to do is eat and work out as a dude. have a computer, have an internet connection, and you just go in there and you have to go work your job, have to do whatever you're going to do to pay for that, but that's going to allow you to work like 20 hours a week, maybe. The rest of your time, you go into trying to make money and taking risk. What are you doing right here? You're taking tons of risk. You are obtaining tons of assets for nothing that could be worth a ton in the future. One of the most important ones is yourself and your future skills in your body. For example, your body is an asset. what you're able to do, how you're able to perform as an asset. Just like LeBron James going on the court and playing basketball. That thing that he is inside of his body is worth billions of dollars. Look at everything it's generated. And the reason he's a billionaire is because he obtained that asset for free. And he took massive risk by investing everything in basketball. His time, his energy, and the rest you already know. So once you've done this, what's going to happen is when you take risk, eventually one of them pays off. When you go first start a business, you're not very good at managing risk. And so what's going to happen as you take risk, your judgment is not going to be as good. Which is why when you first originally take risk, you don't have much leverage and you don't have much judgment. The leverage is usually comes in the form of money. You just have work. And what work allows you to do with risk is manage and alter risk. So for example, when I started Hyros, yes, I put in lots of money. Yes, I hired the staff. Yes, I took risk financially, but I also augmented the risk with my own work and skills. And so what you're able to do when you take risk is you're able to twist it. you're able to play with the dice when you throw it out in the Nether Sphere. And the more effort you put into it through hard work and effort, the more you're able to augment the risk in your favor. If your judgment and ability to manage that risk is not as good as it should be. So, for example, if I was a very, very skilled investor or manager, I could have hired someone to build Hyros and just only paid for it outright and kept a huge chunk of Hyros and had someone else build it. So, you see how that works? It's because I was not as good at judging risk that I had to actually go and manage the risk. And so what you're doing in this initial point of it is your amount your actual leverage is very low. You don't have money. So you can't bring multiple people in and blow something up or just throw money at something when it's really cheap. But you can go out there and invest time and then you can manage the risk itself. Now what's going to happen when you start to do this is one of these risks is going to pay off. I don't care if it's your first job on landing on a freelance site. I don't care if it's your first business actually working. I don't care if it's you digging into like learning how to manage AI and then discovering something new that will work. One of these risks is going to pay off and it's going to start giving you leverage and it's going to start giving you money. And what you do at this point is you immediately start taking more risk. Let's say you learn how to make little AI agent bots. That's really popular online right now. Well, the second you know how to do that, you need to go and say, "All right, I'm going to start selling these to businesses." Maybe you're doing it for a business at first as like a support agent or something like that. Then you go and start selling it to businesses yourself. Okay? Now, you need to take more risk. You hire more people. You take that money to hire people. You take more risk with that and you hire those people. And then you start selling their time to businesses. Then you go out on your own and you find new ways to throw that money and other people's time and energy other than your own at things. Ak you are taking risk on risk on risk on risk. So what most people do when they win their first risk or two and they start making money. That's a that's a dollar sign by the way. They start making money. What they didn't do is they stop taking risks. They stop and they slow down. They go, "No, no, no, no. I've had enough. This is this is too scary." And then what happens? They try to outwork. They try to outpace everybody, but they don't go and make more money again because they stop taking risk. If you stop taking risk with your business, aka something that might be uncertain and can send you backwards or again what we're truly doing in purely analytical terms is we are putting money in a place where the outcome of that money is going to be uncertain. And we're using that money to obtain assets that value in the future is going to be uncertain. Now, of course, we can alter the outcome of those assets. Sometimes you can go into a business, you buy the business, you alter it, the business becomes much more valuable. You're manipulating the risk behind it. You're playing with the die. But at the end of the day, the main thing most humans try to avoid and the reason why they end up poor is because they don't take risk. If you constantly take risk, always, always, always, always. The risk eventually pay off. And then what you finally need to learn how to do is how to take risk without blowing up your entire life. So, what I talked about earlier on in this video about getting your life costs very low, that's an example of hedging for risk. So, if you have all this rent and all this stuff that you have to pay for in your life that's taking up all your money, you're not able to take risk. How do we make [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tons of money? We take risk. So, if you have money going towards other things that is stopping you from taking risk and giving you time to put your time in the risk, what are you doing? You are making yourself poor. But then, let's imagine your first risk pays off. So, let's imagine you're making 100k a year. What people then do is they then go and make the bank mistake I just talked about just at a higher level. They go and get some type of lifestyle or they move into a nice place instead of moving that money back and putting it back into risk. If you ever watch Mr. Beast, how did Mr. Beast actually get rich? One, his videos very clickable. Great use of the YouTube algorithm, but really he reinvested every single damn dollar, every ounce of leverage he had back into his business. He never took any money for like the entire time. You can see how powerful that is. But more so what you want to do more like a normal person is when you have this you go and then structure your life in a way where the risks are not going to ruin you so you can keep taking more risk. So for example when I was starting Hyros yeah I was investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in a month into Hyros but I had a business that was also generating hundreds of thousand dollars a month and I kept my lifestyle cost very very low. You can see how I balanced one risk with anti-risk and intelligently backing it up. What a lot of people do when they think about risk is they think you have to go allin. You never go all in unless you're a crazy person like Mr. Beast. You can do that all you want. By all means, go. But if you want to be smart, that's why we keep our lifestyles low or we set up hedges against our bets. So, if I'm going to bet a million dollars building this software company, you better bet I have a million dollars and everything saved up if it goes wrong. You plan for things to go wrong and then you take more risk. And so what you really want to do, my little buddy, as I start this video, is you need to structure your entire life around rapidly being able to take as much risk as possible and as much big risk as possible. You want to find ways to hedge your life and build it around it so that when you take these big risks, you have a backs stop that allows you to then take these risks without going nuts. And what a lot of people do is they don't build that back stop or they don't think about that. And then when they think about taking the risk, they think they have to take too much risk and then if they lose on that risk, they're going to lose it all. that's like I can't invest in these things cuz then it's going to hurt my lifestyle and everything. You need to just remove the thing that will be damaged behind it so you can keep taking more risk. And as soon as you have success with that risk, you set up another situation again where you've backed up the risk, you've made it so you're safe and you're able to take another big risk. And you just do this over and over and over and over again. And if you do this, all right, what's going to happen if you mess up one of those big risk? For example, when I started Hyros, I had a business before that we launched it. It didn't do so well. It didn't do too great, but it didn't ruin me because I set up and I hedged against it. So what did I do again? I took another risk because I had that hedge. I said, "Okay, cool. We're going to take another one." Hyro was built based on some valuation. That's a multi-figure company right now. Do you see how that works? Same thing worked with my businesses. When I had my first info businesses or my core selling businesses that don't really make enough money to go to distance, I used those to hedge to build my business. And then when I was building those info businesses or those original SEO businesses, I had a job. I hedged that took risk. And so, you have to set up your entire life to take risk. That is the point of this video. That is all you need to do. And if you just do that one concept over and over again, you will eventually hit gold. And then you repeat the process over and over and over again. And that's the only thing you truly need to understand about getting rich. Like, subscribe. That's a video.

TITLE: How The .01% Get Rich Faster Than Everyone Else (Tax Free)
VIDEO ID: eieJOF4kYaE

================================================================================

So, I don't know if you heard. I'm just being humble of of course you've heard, but as you may know or not know really, I'm obnoxiously rich. And one of the reasons I'm obnoxiously rich is I move money in a very specific way that allows me to rapidly grow my net worth every single year without even needing to get paid. So, for example, just in the last year alone, I've increased my net worth by 20 $30 million at least. And that's not even factoring the money that I make for my businesses or crypto or my portfolios. And it's because I use a very tricky system for managing money that basically every single person that cleanly keeps past a 9 figureure net worth uses. Every single turbo rich person you know is doing this. They do not focus on actually making money. They focus on this. And if you understand what I'm going to show you in this video, you will be able to do the same exact thing too. Even if you are an employee, this is by far the most effective way to obtain wealth and spend wealth that there is bar none. If you do anything other than this, you're a goof troop. So pay attention. So the first thing you need to do is stop trying to make money in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ways. If you do this, eventually you run out of time because you die and then you can't make any more money. The goal is to make a lot of money and then spend it obscenely aggressively while you're still alive. Yachts, tigers, exotic woods, paying dudes pretending to be girls on Only Fans. That's how real men spend their money. And that's our goal, gentlemen. Your family, your children, this is not the channel for you. But jokes aside, we want to make money as fast as possible and then have the ability to spend it comfortably and enjoy our lives and enjoy that wealth. The way people try to make money, it doesn't work like that. Cuz what most people try and do is they try to make money from a job or make money from a business, it really doesn't matter. Then they get sent this money and if they live in America, they pay 40% tax in it, which makes things much harder. And then they also try to live off of that money at the same time. And then even if you're making, let's say, $2 million per year and then that money inflates and then it goes into the stock market, it goes up and it it's just a total disaster the way people try and make money because you don't want to make money off of income because it's very very slow. I don't care if you're LeBron James. I don't care if you're working a job at a marketing agency. I don't care if you're a business owner. It's really bad to try and get rich this way. Now, look, I make a lot of money per year in income, but that's absolutely not my focus. What I'm trying to do here is make 30, $50, $100 million per year in net worth. And I'll explain why here in a minute and how I do this because it applies down to anything. If you're trying to get to a million dollar net worth, you're trying to get to 5 million, 10 million, 100 million, same exact thing. So, look, I want you to actually stop looking at money as generating income. I mean, what you want to do with money is you want to view the best way to get rich is to obtain assets for less than they'll be worth in the future. I know that sounds simple, but there's really only one way that people get obscenely rich. It's by obtaining an asset for much less than it's worth in the future. Let me break down three examples that you see every single day. For example, an athlete, their body is an asset. It's worth nothing when they're born. They obtain 100% ownership of it. They go play in the NBA. They make $40 million per year. How do they go and get so rich here? They obtain the asset. A business, you start it from scratch. You they go and build the business from scratch. You obtain it day one. You get 100% ownership of it. You grow the business being worth $100 million. How did you make all that money? You obtained the asset when it was worth nothing. Now, the other way that people view it and the way I'm talking is they think about investing or whatever or you find inefficiencies in the market. For example, a really good example is after the 2008 crisis, people were really, really, really hating on high-risisk loans. And so while high-risisk loans were of course risky, they were being massively undervalued for the amount of risk that they had. So for example, if the loan was actually really worth $100, $200, people were selling them for $50 just because they were high-risisk loans. Yes, they were a shitty bad asset, but they were being valued way way below the ratio that their shitty badness warranted. Thus, a person that I know made an absolute killing just going and buying all these for $10 and then selling them for $100 at appropriate value like five years later. That's another example. For this example right here though, we want to focus on business and controlling the equity of businesses. And then we want to focus on growing the value of these businesses to high amounts at all cost. Why? So, the thing you need to understand about businesses, once they get to a certain size, you can borrow against them. You can also use the businesses to obtain assets which you can then borrow against. You need to understand that most people that are really really rich, they never actually make any money. What happens is they control a bunch of assets. So let's say someone obtains assets for $100 million and those appreciate over time if it's invested well or if it's a fast growing company, whatever by 5 to 8% per year. And so with this money right here, especially if it's a fast growing company, you really don't want to take money out of the company because then it's going to be taxed. And the point of this video is not taxed, by the I'm not here to tell you like how to get around taxes and whatnot. That's not the point of this video. The way you get around taxes is you move to Dubai and you stop being an American citizen. The end. There you go. There's your there's your tax le. But even so, it's very bad if you're an American citizen moving money in and out of business is because then you do pay the 40% tax or the 20% tax. Regardless, that doesn't really matter. What we want to try and do is we want to blow up this asset so that we can then borrow against it. So, let's say for example, you build a $200 million company. the dividends from this company is generating you let's say5 to10 million a year. This is great right here. Fine, whatever. But the more important thing is you can easily buy or borrow $30 million against the company and then pay the interest when it's not at 5% interest rates. Let's say we're at 2 to 3% interest rates out of the dividends it provides. And so what a lot of people are trying to do when they're building their company is they're just focused on getting this money out of the company, but then the company never grows. when in reality what you want to do is you want to grow the company valuation that then allows you to easily borrow against the company and the assets underneath it. So look what do most entrepreneurs and most people trying to make money do? So let's say you got a million dollar per year business in profit. Okay, it makes $2 million a year making $1 million a year in profit right here. So what most people are going to do is they're going to pay themselves this profit right here or they're going to try and they're they're going to try to keep the money. Maybe they'll keep it in their business and spend it some other wahoo way. I don't know. This is really stupid because what we want to eventually do is we want to be able to borrow against the value of the company. So what we can do is if we're making a $2 million per year business and 1 million in profit, the first thing you want to do is think where can I invest this money in the business that will grow the valuation the largest. So for example, let's say you have a software company and you have 10% churn. At a $2 million valuation or $2 million per year, you probably have like a company that's worth 10 million $15 million give or take. this company would be worth 30 $40 million if you got the churn down the 3%. So instead of going taking that money, you reinvested everything to get it down to 3% and instead of growing your net worth $5 million, you just grew your net worth $30 million. Do you see how that works right there? That's what someone will literally pay for the company. If you have a $2 million per year company at like 2% 3% churn, the valuation of the company is then going to skyrocket on top of you making much more money and whatnot. But then the other way you want to think about this is of course you're going to have profit coming in and sometimes you're not going to be able to have ways to invest it in the company. So let's say you got a million dollars in profit right here. What you can do is just buy a $1 million building or real estate with the company for an office based on how things climb. One, you didn't have to take money out of the company. Two, it's 100% tax deductible because you're spending it on the company. Three, this office is probably going to grow in value at 5 to 8% year if you bought it correctly. And this ultimately then goes down to the company value which you can then borrow against. And the way you want to start structuring your finances that works very very very well is you never actually want to be making any income. What you want to be doing is finding every way to stack up the valuations of your assets. Whether it's by reinvesting the money in the company or obtaining assets to appreciate in value and then holding them underneath the company. Now, there's a lot of times in business where you can buy assets that serve the business that also appreciate over time, which allows you, if you're in the United States, to basically not pay any tax on it while getting an asset that appreciates in value. So, for example, an office, land, and there's a lot of other creative things you can do to basically keep investing back in your business and buying assets for your business, but then those assets also appreciate. Now, of course, when you sell the assets and you have to pay capital gains tax and whatnot, but I'm not here to talk about the c the tax code. What you need to start focusing on is the way I try to structure my income and I don't borrow anywhere near amount of this money. But let's say I got a $50 million stock portfolio or when I take money out or anything, I want to have my assets. Now, if you take the money out and use it to buy a house, you use it to buy something, use it to pay for something, the money is not deployed functionally well. So, for example, you can keep this money in the stock market and make about 5 to 8% per year. Or you can go and take out, let's say, $3 million from the 50 million to buy a home that makes you nothing. Or what you can do when rates are much lower is you can borrow the $3 million while leaving it inside your portfolio. That increases at 5 to 8% or more per year. And then you pay from that 5 to 8% the 2% interest rates or whatever the interest rates will be on that money. The rates are very high right now, so you can't do this as easily as you used to be able to do it in the past, but rates will be low again. And so what I'm trying to encourage you to do in this video is the way you need to view everything, everything you do is you need to look at the total value of your net worth and the appreciation of that network for your stocks via your company. The two best ways to grow your wealth is one, if you make money from your businesses, try to keep it in the businesses and acquire assets that increase in value. So for example, your business makes $3 million. You could buy a $3 million office building that appreciates in value. Then borrow against the value of that building to pay for things with set prices like your home, your car. I wouldn't suggest building your lifestyle or day-to-day expenses off of borrowing. You want to buy things that are also assets that are not going to lose value, which most people's big purchases are going to be their car, home, stuff like that. You see a lot of people, for example, go and use their business and they purchase a private jet and then they rent the private jet out. So they have an asset that they didn't pay tax on while they own the private jet while the private jet flies around and makes them money off the asset. So this is how you have to start really viewing your money. And then if you do pay yourself out, what you never ever ever want to do is spend your money on lifestyle or anything like that until that money is working like this. So let's say you want to have a 50,000 per month lifestyle, right? Requires you 50k a month. This is going to require you about 600k a year. So, what you're going to need probably at this point is a $10 million portfolio generating you $500,000 to $800,000 per year in the stock market via lending, whatever you want to do from that, then you can spend out of this. Your lifestyle money should never ever surpass 5% of the money, the liquid money you actually have on hand. Never, ever, ever. And so, your goal forever and ever should be two things. If you take money out of your business or you keep any money, it's to invest it in assets that generate returns. But more importantly, your goal as a business owner or an employee is to try and build equity in the value of that equity. Now, you're not as able to do this if you're an employee unless you get large stakes in a company, which you can as an employee. I have employees at my companies that are at this point close to being eight figure millionaires because the equity they originally got in Hyros day one. But most importantly, if you're the owner of a business, which most of you guys are, you don't want to be taking money out of the business and doing that. You want to think, all right, cool. We have a business that's worth $5 million, $1 million. How do we get this business to 10 million, $50 million? Then when it's worth $50 million, you can easily borrow $10 million for whatever you're doing. Keep that money. Keep the ownership of the company. You don't want to sell 10% of the company. You keep that money right there. And then you pay off the interest on this, which would be 2 to 5%. Much lower if the rates are low with the income that you make from the company. This is really koi when you go to buying a house or something like that because then you can go, let's say you buy a $10 million house. The house also starts appreciating because you own it now. You didn't have to pay any taxes. You didn't take anything out of the company. You didn't have to sell any of your ownership of the company. And the house is appreciating more than the money that you're using to pay for the house. And so your ultimate goal when you're first starting your business is again grow the value of the asset. I am not saying you grow a $50 million business and you take out a $25 million loan. You got a you should really keep the amount you borrow off your business, which I borrow nothing off my businesses right now. I borrow against like my portfolios and whatnot. But I easily could if I wanted to borrow against my businesses. I just don't do that. But this is a much better way in the future when I grow my business to 400 million, $500 million valuation. If I want to buy a jet or I want to invest the money, these are the paths that I'm going to be using to buy things like that. If I'm making $20 million a year from the business, I'm not going to go and give myself $20 million. I'm going to buy a $20 million office building or asset that then appreciates in value more. I just gave you a whole bunch of different ways to start viewing money. But the thing you need to take from this video that I just broke out is that we're constantly building this giant blob of money and we never want to take money out of that blob. We can borrow against a blob. We can find ways where the blob drips money out through dividends and whatnot to cover interest rates of money that we borrow. while never actually selling anything in the blob because the blob is going to grow at about 5 to 8% a year on average. If you have a business, the thing we want to do is just grow the blob so big we can easily move irrelevant amounts of money out of it by borrowing and then move the money back. So, for example, if you have a $100 million business, you borrow $10 million against it for a house. You then hold the house for a couple years. The house turns into being worth $12 million. You sell the house for a profit. You put that money back into the loan from the company or the amount you borrowed based on the company. You can then pocket the profit rolled into other real estate or and the most basic way is you kept the money actively in your company without selling any ownership of your company while still being able to get the house at the same exact time. This is just such smarter ways to move money around and build income. Because if you're going out there and you're just spending all the money you make, that bubble, that thing you're going to be able to borrow against is going to be finite. It's never going to grow. It's never going to make you more money. It's never going to grow to a higher valuation. You're just going to get stuck. This is what most entrepreneurs do when they pay themselves. This is why so many athletes get in trouble is because the money that they have coming from their asset is finite and they run out of money from that asset. You never want to touch the asset. All in all, I know this wasn't the funniest video because I kind of got into all the nitty-gritty of how money works and how the ways you should look at money. And I think a lot of things I just said there was wrong and they're not as specific as they need to be, but I just wanted to teach you a little little tiny lesson about how rich people view money differently than normal people. So, you should use it. Okay. Bye.

TITLE: Why being happy will ruin your life. STOP and Do This
VIDEO ID: wj1V-0nogik
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj1V-0nogik
================================================================================

I hate self-help, which is why I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate getting all Tony Robbins with you guys, but I have to make this one video. It's going to fix your entire life. It did mine. Let's get into it. You believe you are unhappy because you're not as successful as you'd like to be. There might be other reasons, but the point of this channel is success, hence why you're watching this video. But the reason you are actually unhappy and suffering, and the reason why you're not as successful as you want to be is because you're trying to be happy. And no, I'm not about to go on some Andrew Tate, get on the sufferer bus or some gogggins, self-help, be unhappy and hate your life the entire time to be successful kind of mantra. That's stupid, not helpful. I promise you by the end of this video, all the unhappiness that you're feeling about your current level of success or where you are in life right now will just be gone and you'll be much more successful. So, you'll be good and making more progress towards whatever [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you want to do if you just listen to me for the next 10 minutes. Doing this has allowed me to make hundreds of millions of dollars while not being upset and suffering the entire time like everyone on YouTube loves to brag about. I'm generally pretty good all the time. You can be too. This will also fix everything else you're looking to do. Whether it's getting a six-pack, talk to girls, get your head under control, be successful, whatever you want to do. I'm not I'm going to stop telling you about it. Let me just explain it. See, the entire crux of this problem is society's definition of what happiness is. Because of this definition, not only are people constantly ruining themselves and making themselves extremely unhappy all the time by trying to always be happy, but they are also thinking that they have to suffer and live some terrible bad life and sacrifice everything for their goals. No, you don't have to do any of that. You just have to understand the definition for happiness is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Societyy's really messed it up and it's just made us all brain damaged retards about the way we go about pursuing life. See, what people describe happiness as and what society describes happiness as is actually euphoria. Think about it. When was the last time you were happy? When when was your peak happiness? If you're like most people, it's some crazy euphoric moment in your life or when you were high or really really drunk or playing video games. You were it was 1:00 a.m. A lot of people look back when they were kids playing video games at 1:00 a.m. with all their friends trolling around in World of Warcraft. It's some really really high point, aka euphoria. And see, you're describing happiness incorrectly because what most people try to do with their life is they focus on being happy. But the problem is they're not trying to be happy. They're trying to be chronically euphoric. And this is where the entire problem comes from. Because when you use euphoria as your definition for happiness, which essentially everybody does, you have set the goal to an impossibly high standard that can only be achieved through unimaginable highs inflicted by some crazy, very rare life experience or induced chemically or through manipulation. See, compared to these euphoric moments in your life, life is very boring. If you look at a well-lived life, let's say you live it perfectly and you're not doing heroin 24/7, you're mostly going to be fine most of the time. You're going to be bored a lot of the time. Life compared to those high moments in your life is boring. Life compared to playing a video game is boring. Life compared to drinking is very boring. Life compared to having sex is very boring. It's boring. It's just what it [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is. And the problem, the entire issue with everyone in society right now is they think that the point of life is being happy. But instead, what they're actually confusing it with is again euphoria. So they think because they're not euphoric all the time, because they're not deliriously happy, they are then sad. And thus something must be done to fix it. You must get out of this state of unhappiness, which is actually lack of euphoria. And the entire problem unravels from there. And then it creates another layer of bad because what people are describing fine as is sadness or not being happy. So if you're just sitting around bored, you're unhappy. You're not having a good life. But then what people start to do is they start doing things that separate them from having a good life, which is success, health, productivity, mental well-being. They do a bunch of things that separate them from this so that they can become happy. which for the rest of this video I want you to understand when I say happy I mean euphoric which is a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] level of delirious happiness that we think we have to be experiencing 24/7 and that we're chronically pursuing. You're at work, you're working. Oh, it's so boring. I'm It's not fun here. I'm sad. This isn't good. I hate my job. I can't wait to go home and play World of Warcraft or video games or eat ice cream or whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] weird [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you guys do alone in your studio apartments or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. I know my viewers. You guys are watching from your mom's basement. I can see the dungeon now. Crusty socks in the corner, walls painted with henti posters. It's my life mission on this channel to get you guys the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of there. You got to stop living under the staircase like Harry Potter and talking to dudes pretending to be girls on Only Fans. I'm here to save you. Trust me. Don't worry. But you think when you're doing a normal day-to-day thing like working, you're having a bad time. You hate this part of your life because you have to go home to play or do whatever thing you're going to do that gives you euphoria. So, thus you're in pain unless you're in this euphoric state. Unless I'm playing Monster Hunter, unless I have a subtle buzz, I'm unhappy. And this is most people. I've even been there. Every weekend you're working, working, working. It's boring. You think, well, I just can't wait till the weekend when I can be happy again and go get drunk with the boys or go party. And then suddenly all the stuff you're doing during the week isn't fun. And how you define your life and why you go and destroy yourself every weekend is to be happy, aka euphoric. Do you see where the problem starts to come from? Because everything that makes your life better and makes your life good becomes painful in comparison to this bar that we've set, which is actually euphoria. If you're starting to grasp this, now this is where it gets a little bit deeper. This is where you can actually start to apply what we're looking at right here and see how [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up the way everyone lives is. So, if you're in America or whatever, everybody defines happiness again as new. And so, two really nasty things start to pop up. One, day-to-day basic life becomes painful. It becomes suffering. Being bored is now painful and suffering. So, you must get out of this state no matter what. And because in our society because we define our lives and how well we are living them based on happiness which is again misdefined. We feel that we are not living life correctly if we're in this normal state. This is not good. People go to therapy. People go in support groups. They do everything they can to get out of the state because this right here just living a day-to-day life is unbearable. If a person's sitting around bored in their studio apartment this is suddenly very bad. And because in our society, everything we feel is extremely important. Everything that happens right here or right here is extremely important. These these high feelings right here, incredibly important. These low feelings right here, incredibly important. None of them are [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] important. The default state of life, the default state of how you're going to be and exist for the rest of your life is going to be like this. You're going to have states where you're low. You're going to have states where you're high. And I'm going to give you a cliff note on what the true definition of happiness actually is. It's not suffering or being chronically stressed or having to deal with bad things throughout these states. It's being able to wake up and your body feels good. You're financially good. You're mentally good. Your family and everybody's good. You're good. You're okay. You're fine. You're in a normal state of mind without the world being on fire. That's what happiness is. And that's the happiest you can ever expect out of life. Because I don't care if you're a billionaire. I don't care if you're living in the Playboy mansion banging every chick in there. I don't care whatever whatever hentai World of Warcraft fantasy you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are looking for. I don't care. You're going to experience this. Whether you are crippled or a billionaire, your life is going to be these waves right here. But because people value their emotions so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] much. Every single one of these waves up here and right here is incredibly important. And they're constantly trying to get themselves up here and get away from right here when this is just the normal state of life. And because they try to get up here constantly and they can't they can't accept just being in this normal range right here, they end up going 10 times lower because what they then inflict on themselves is pain and suffering on top of this normal life experience that they find unbearable in the first place. And then you stack failure, you stack being fat, you stack being ugly, you stack being tired and unhealthy all the time, you stack all the other things that come from short-term bad behavior to make yourself happy. And then suddenly you actually live a very bad life. Let's take happiness out of the equation. You never get to even just be normal. You are constantly in a state of pain and suffering trying deeply out of to get out of this hole back up to here. And the only way you can do that is with unimaginable manipulation of your brain and the chemicals inside of it. And here's where everything starts to get really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. Because in our society, again, we define happiness as the most important thing and our emotions as the most important thing. Your emotions are literally an organ in your head [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chemicals on your brain telling you whether something is good or bad. Like you you can know whether something's really good or bad based on all the conclusions you can draw from in your life experiences and logic. But sometimes good things don't seem good. Like going to the gym and working out, it doesn't seem that good all the time. Sometimes doing something like your taxes so you don't end up in jail doesn't feel good, but it is the good thing to do. So frankly, that organ in your head really has no concept of what good or bad is. It looks at little codes and things that are happening around you and uses this lizard brain to inject chemicals in your brain to tell you whether something is good or bad in its opinion, which is completely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and based on something 5,000 years ago. So, we're valing this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ass opinion on what's good or bad and then using that to justify how we are living our life. And so, what most people do is because they judge happiness as the most important thing and their emotions are the most important thing. All the all these people going to therapy, all these people walking around doing all these bad habits. Why are they doing all these things? because they want to live a little. They want to live life a little. When you tell someone to stop drinking, like, "Hey, dude, you want to be successful? Maybe go and stop getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] wasted every weekend." Yeah, but you got to live life as well. What they're really saying is, "I'm doing this thing so I can be happy." Like, cuz the point of living is to be happy. So, I got to balance like work with happiness. Ooh, if you replace the word happiness with euphoria, what did we just do? Hey, I have to be euphoric. I I'm trying to do all these things so I can be euphoric time. And this entire chase of euphoria is then what makes us go deeper in the hole and makes the default life which people find unbearable aka being bored or not being euphoric all the time that adds another layer of fun to it which is pain and suffering. And then when people repeat these actions to be happy they end up going down a slide of pain and suffering on top of everything else they're looking to avoid. Let me explain. So if you look around our society people we just got fat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] whales of people running around everywhere. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Teletubbies running around shoving stuff in their mouth just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out fire. Their buttholes, their stomach, their face, their everything's just on fire all the time. Just terrible life experience. And they do all these things they know are bad for them. But why would people keep doing something that's bad for them? Because happiness [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] matters, which is not really happiness. It's euphoria. Let's look at a few things that people do that is really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid. They go and eat cake. This is cake, by the way. They go and play video games. This is video games, by the way. They go and drink. They avoid work. They sit around social media all day. They do all these things and we all know these are bad. So why do people do them if they make your life actively worse? Like all these things come with massive consequences and we all know them. Now there's no like playing dumb anymore. You can sit around, you see people smoking cigarettes all the time. Why are they smoking cigarettes even though they know all the terrible things that come with it? You do all these things, your brain declines. You are distracted. You feel like crap. You do less well with opposite sex. You're not motivated. You feel terrible all the time. You get fat. You get deformed. Like your body literally changes in deformity. Yes, being fat is deformed. It's not something that naturally occurs. It's when you shove so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] food in your face that your body actively becomes deformed. You didn't see cavemen. You didn't see [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thick ass cavemen running through the woods back in the day with their bonkadonss running around all thick as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] It doesn't happen to a normal human body. It only comes through aggressive mistreatment of your body. Like if you punch yourself 15 times in the face and your face is all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up afterwards. Same exact thing. Regardless, I I think you guys know my opinion on fats. Why do people do these things then? It's because happiness is incredibly incredibly [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] important, which is actually euphoria. So, why do why do why do we go and eat a cake? Why do we go eat cake? Well, the cake, what it actually does is it makes your brain, that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing in your head that can't tell its ass from its dick. It makes it go, "Wow, awesome." And it it showers it with tons of chemicals because all the stuff in it is unnaturally sweet. It's something you'd never be able to find in nature. Why do you love playing video games more than work? It's because the video game is literally rigged to touch every button in your little monkey brain to make it go haywire and dump chemicals in your brain. Why is getting drunk with people you don't know that you don't talk to when you're sober and you're never going to talk to in a couple years if you stop drinking and you don't even like to talk to normally. Why Why is it so much fun hanging out with them? Oh yeah, it's because your brain is dumping every single chemical it can possibly get all at once because alcohol's hitting your brain. It's the way with every single bad habit that destroys people and slows them down. And the problem is people think this is what happiness is. They they confuse happiness with chemicals being poured on their brain. I'm playing World of Warcraft right now and I've played it. It's a ton of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fun. I'm happy, which is really my brain and every sensor in my brain firing off and dumping chemicals on my mind telling me that I'm being productive with my life. Now, is that what happiness is? I don't want to dig down that path because at that point, we could just say doing heroin 24/7 is happiness. So, let's back up and make a more less confusing definition. Let's define happiness with having a good life that is not stressful and you achieve the things you want to do regardless of what they are. It doesn't have to be money, anything. You're just not stressed. You're good most of the time. Nothing bad is happening and you can manage your life very functionally and well. Let's define happiness as getting everything you want. Good health, money, losing your virginity. I know that's a lot of you guys in this channel. All those things right there. Let's define it as that. By the definition of that, doing these things right here separates you from happiness. But again, most people's definition of happiness is chemicals being poured on their brain or some height of euphoria that you can't achieve. And the reason why our lives go to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because of this is because we define our lives by our happiness. And our happiness is actually euphoria. And this euphoria is at such an unimaginably high level of stimulation to our brains and manipulation that there's no way we can ever recreate it ever. You can't be chronically happy all the time. You can't be chronically euphoric all the time. You can't have your first kiss or see Star Wars for the first time every single damn day. You just can't. and it's okay. And most of the pain and suffering we have comes from the fact that we think it's not okay. And we think that we have to constantly fix it. And the only way you can really get these levels of euphoria consistently is through short-term things that really mess up your life. If you go practice jiu-jitsu, the most euphoric moment you're going to have is when you win a competition or you do something really special, you get like your necks built up. Most of the time it's going to be really boring if you're getting good at and you're achieving what you want to do. Same thing with guitar. Same thing with everything else. And it's the fact that you think that everything has to be that euphoric moment that you stop getting all those things that you actually want to do. And the reason why again people then up end up ruining everything in their life and separating themselves from the things they actually want to do is because they think happiness aka being euphoric all the time is the most important thing. And they can't just sit in their [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] bedroom and do nothing. They can't go on a walk. They can't be without their phone. They have to eat cake. And when you tell them not to do it, they say, "Well, I want to live a little and it's more important to me that I want to live life." No, you just can't stop [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] masturbating. in every sense of the word. Even if your hands off your dick, you can't stop putting cake in your mouth, masturbating. You can't stop drinking, masturbating. You can't stop manipulating your body for your own pleasure, regardless of the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] consequences. And this is why if you're chronically unhappy all the time or suffering just like everybody else's, this is why. Because you think it is a massive problem to not be happy all the time. Here's the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] truth. Most of your life, like I said, you're just going to be fine. You're going to be okay. You're going to have ups and downs. If you look at a person who's crippled, for example, their baseline of happiness or how good they feel all the time goes exactly back to the same point it was when they had legs. It takes a few months, but most of the time they go back to the same exact levels. So, you can become a billionaire. You can do anything you want. You're not going to escape that pattern of happiness. It doesn't matter. There's nowhere for you to go. You have no point of happy. There's no point in your life where you're going to do everything you want to do and then suddenly you could just sit in a room and be okay with yourself and everything's gonna be great. It's not going to happen the end. you're just you're stuck. There's nowhere for you to go. The only place for you to go is to not go somewhere bad, which is pain suffering through a mismanaged life. And the reason why people mismanage their life is because they're trying to always be up here and they think it's a problem when they're just right here in this normal place, which is inevitably where you're always going to be at. So, let's wrap this up. I told you at the beginning of this video that I would tell you how to not be unhappy all the time. Here's how. Just be okay being fine. You're fine. You're not near your phone. You're not out having fun. You're not doing fun stuff. It's fine. Stop fighting it. Just It's okay. It's all right. You're good now. Congratulations. You don't have to fix [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anything. Next. I told you this would make you more successful. Guess what you can do if you just accept being fine and you don't have to be euphoric all the time. If you don't have to be having the best weekend of your life every weekend, if life doesn't have to be as good. You stop saying, "hm, the peak of my life was playing World of Warcraft or some huge dopamine addicting thing. Going to Vegas or whatever." For example, I used to think, "Oh man, I'm going to work a few months and then I'm going to really go be happy in Vegas and party or I'm going to work for eight hours and then I'm going to do what actually makes me happy and play some World of Warcraft." I'm sure we've all been there in some shape or form. And we think we're going to suffer and then do what really makes us happy when really the bar of happiness is just this euphoria and what we're doing already is fine. And if we stop fighting it, we could just do more of it. And if you do more of those things without a chronically punishing yourself and making yourself suffer for just being fine, which is what everybody does, and then b resorting to short-term things that separate you and drag you away from that and make your life worse. They take you out of that normal state you're at and then drag you down to hell with it. Tell you what, I'm going to tell you one way you're going to be actually unhappy by the euphoric definition of the word. If you're a fat, unsuccessful [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] who has the mental stability and skill set of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] baby koala, that's that's going to make you unhappy. I don't care what definition the word is. You might as well just go punch yourself in the dick. That's what it's going to feel like your entire life. And the only way to get there is if you're constantly trying to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] happy. Guess what? If you're not trying to be happy all the time and euphoric, you won't do all this short-term [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] cuz it doesn't matter cuz you know, like it's just you poking a button and masturbating. It's the same exact thing as grabbing your dick and going and watching the closest thing that resembles a woman. I know you Gen Z guys are getting pretty creative what you jack off to on the internet these days, but it's all the same exact thing. It's just manipulating your brain to make yourself happy. If you stop punishing yourself for those things, guess what? You're going to be good all the time. So, you don't even have to become even more successful if you don't want, it's not going to change anything. But say you want to decide to make your life more about goals and achieving the things you say you're going to do and like getting the things that you want. It's going to make it 10 times easier to go get those things you want because you can just sit there and be like, "Hey, I'm kind of bored." And that's fine. Like, it's okay. Like, you're okay as long as someone's not trying to stab you or put you in jail or your house isn't on like everything's fine. Like, it's fine. There's no scorecard being kept. like you don't do certain things or whatever. Someone's going to punch you in the dick when you die. You're just going to forget literally everything when you die and it's all fine. Like just just chill. It's not that important. Then you can just sit there and do the thing. And then when like you're like, "Oh, but I'm not happy." You can do something that nobody else does where just say, "That's fine." Instead of like every other fat stupid [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in our society who gets on Instagram like, "Oh, I got to look at butts and boobs and then shove a cake in my mouth and then go wake up the next day and wonder why you work a dead-end job. You don't make much money. You look like a foot so you never get laid. And you got this this sack of fat that's gradually growing over your belt like every other dude past the age of 35. So that's the video. Stop trying to be happy. Just be okay being fine. It's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fine.

TITLE: You'll HATE It, But It Will Make You Rich In A Year [Full Blueprint]
VIDEO ID: VVPECdnzXSA
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVPECdnzXSA
================================================================================

No, you skeptical, negative, silly, silly sack of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] To tell this video is not clickbait. In this video, I'm going to show you what I believe is a guaranteed guaranteed way to get rich reasonably within a year. And by rich, I mean being able to generate 100K, maybe even a few hundredk per year. We're not talking about making millions and millions of dollars, just enough to say, "Fuck you. I do what I want to whoever and anything you want. Your dog, your boss, your old neighbor, maybe a baby you walk by on the street cuz you're an asshole." You'll have the money coming in. you'll have the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you ability and you should listen to me because I built more sevenf figureure businesses than I can count even from when I was broke getting out of the military. And guess what? I'm not going to sell you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So, let's get into it. So, look, if you want to make [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you money, which is enough money to do what you want, 100k, 200k, 300k a year, those are the numbers I'm going to focus on in this video cuz I've made a video on how to get to a million dollars per year and I've made a video on how to get to $10 million per year. This one's for all you low achievers who only want to make enough money to pay your rent and sit in your house and get high. Don't worry, I got you, too. But the thing is, if you want to make enough money to live comfortably and fund yourself, which is that range, you really don't have to do anything special. This is the big general confusion. You can literally do what everybody else is doing and just do it, okay? And get your small slice of the pie because this amount of money isn't anything particularly huge. My business usually generates this money in a single day. So, you can really be a low achiever here and you can do absolutely nothing original. What you need to understand is that your main goal here is to just get good enough at what you're trying to do to get your small piece of the pie. What I compare this to is look, people that are making $10 million per year in the NFL, they're the best players in the world. But if you want to make just enough income to fund yourself or get started and continue your journey in business, you we really only have to get to AFL dumpster fire levels of skill at the sport we're trying to play, which in this case would be football. And so we really need to prioritize is getting good enough. So how do we do that? Well, it comes down to what I'm going to tell you is the trifecta of getting good enough. This is three things you need to do in your life. And if you do these three things, you will get good enough at whatever the business model is and you will make this money. And I will fully tell you how to do this in this video. Again, I'm not going to sell you some mastermind or mindset course. I've built a business valued around $150 to $200 million high-risisk. And I've built more sevenfigure and eight figure businesses than I can count. In my 15 years of business, I've done this from when I was broke to where I am now. And the most inefficient way I can make more money is by selling you a course or some coaching like most YouTube channels. That's not going to make me real rich. So just sit back, enjoy the content. You're going to get it all in this video and then anything else you need to learn for this video, it's on this channel as well. But this is the most important first step because these three things right here, if you get them done, I cannot fathom you not making money. you can be an absolute [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you will still make money because it's all just about getting good enough. And the reason why people fail to get good enough is they do not go and do these three things and then the rest of their life blocks them from getting good enough until they're old and then they never get good enough to actually make money on their own. And the reason it doesn't seem this obvious and the reason it seems like it can't be this simple is because people think money is some spiritual journey or some god-given talent that some people have and some people don't. No, it's simply having enough skill in a certain area to perform. It's the same as learning guitar. It's the same as learning jiu-jitsu. Those video games you've gotten good at because you spent eight hours a day playing them. Those thousands of hours you logged in World of Warcraft and all the expertise you have there, same exact [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing, except this time it won't come with crippling virginity, and your father will be proud of you. So, this is an added plus for most of you cuz let's look in the mirror. Most of you guys are not tall or good-looking enough to get women normally. Getting rich is about the last shot you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] got here. So listen, or you're going to be dating fats for the rest of your life, okay? And you should really get this content in cuz some fat, grumpy HR lady who works at YouTube is eventually going to watch one of these videos and be deeply offended and just shadowban me off of all YouTube instantly. Look, I'm all for equity inclusion. Just no fat [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Okay. Okay. All right. All right. So, what is what do we need to do to get good enough? So, before I get into these initial things right here, you're probably a little bit confused and you think I'm full of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] because you think it comes down to some business model or some some secret idea or niche that you find on the internet. And that's what everyone on YouTube is going to tell you primarily because they want to set you up to buy a course for them on that secret niche or skill. I'm going to tell you differently because I don't want your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money. I don't want to be responsible for you. You can pick any business method. Go browse YouTube. There's going to be a thousand different business methods out there. There's going to be agency. Start an agency. Do consulting. do coaching, uh, do an e-commerce drop shipping store, make an actual e-commerce product, build software, sell info products, teaching people how to do a certain thing, make AI agents for businesses. They all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] work. Like, trust me, if there's a bunch of videos on them out there on YouTube, you can pretty much make any of these business models work if you're good enough. And you don't even have to be good or excellent at them. Look, we're not trying to make a million dollars per year. If you're trying to make a million dollar per year, $5 million, $10 million per year, which there are videos below this video on how I do that and how I structure businesses to do that. You're going to have to be really good. But all we need to do here is be competent enough to get a small piece of the body. We don't need to beat anybody. We don't have to have a unique business. We don't have to go out there and take other people's customers. You can actually be pretty incompetent and still do this. So, I want you to forget the business model. I want you to forget specifics here because they're not important. So, what we primarily want to focus on is giving ourselves the space to get good enough at whatever business model we're trying to do to make money. So, let's imagine you're playing a sport and you're trying to make money playing that sport. First thing you want to do is pick a sport that has a track record of making money. So, for example, football, soccer, hockey, golf, I don't know. If you see lots of other people making money doing it, you can probably make money doing it as well. Now, we're not trying to become the Tiger Woods. are trying to become the bush league golfer who still managed to have a chronic drinking habit over the the golf season and just drives around the course drunk as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hidden on, you know, the the waiter girls that are out there. That's you. You're not really special, but you put in the time enough to become competent enough at golf that you can drive around shitfaced and still perform. Okay, let's drop the drinking part right there. You can still perform at a competent level and make money doing it. And so, what we're chasing by giving ourselves this space is not a specific business model. We're giving oursel the ability to gain enough experience to get good and master our craft enough that we can make money with it. I want you to really take a second and step back because what most people try and do is they think they need to find a business model or niche and then learn about that and learn some secret techniques and then do it. No, what we're trying to do is reach a level of good. So, for example, if you wanted to make money playing basketball, what you would do is you would go and spend a ton of time practicing basketball. Now, you wouldn't get good enough to make money in basketball if you never had time or the ability to practice basketball at its full extent. So, for example, if you only had 30 minutes and you didn't even have a basketball to play with and you had no one else to play with and so you get done with work and then you go and simulate dribbling with without a basketball at home for 30 minutes and then you don't do it consistently, you're never going to get good enough to play at basketball. However, let's say you kept your online job and you moved to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Thailand next to a basketball court and you could reduce your work hours to 3 4 hours a day and then spend the other four 6 hours of your day practicing basketball with other people that play basketball all day over the span of a year. You would probably get good enough at basketball to have some form of competency. Now, would that be good enough to get into the wash out basketball leagues that actually pay money? No. Because those people are real [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] losers and they've been playing basketball their entire life. intently and they still can't make it. But the competition for those leagues is so high and the spots so few it's actually kind of hard to get into those. But in entrepreneurship there is just millions and millions and millions of spots paying the amount of money that you're looking for. So yes, you would be good enough to get into this level of skill with entrepreneurship if you apply that same mindset that we talked about just with basketball to entrepreneurship. So really what we want to do is we want to set it up in our life so that we can go and set up that scenario I just talked about it in basketball but with entrepreneurship. Now let's look at this and think how do we practice entrepreneurship at its maximum to its fullest extent and give ourselves the room to actually do that and that comes down to that trifecta I talked about before. Also, if you're enjoying this video, subscribe. Here's why. In the future, I'm going to scrape on my subscribers. I'm going to deliver all my past courses and maybe some new courses for free to you that break down everything I've done. Business, my ads. This is stuff that people actually paid a lot of money for in the past. I'm going to give it to you for free, but only if you subscribe. And it's very easy for me to see who subscribed and liking these videos and engaging. That's who I'm going to give this to. If you don't want to do that, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. You get nothing. So just just click a button for hours and hours of free training. That sound fair? Okay, do it. What you're going to need to get good is truly just three things. You're going to need time. You're going to need focus. And you're going to need the ability to do it without fear. And in entrepreneurship, that is risk. All right? So, you need to be able to take risk. Now, let's look at these three things right here and think about how we can build a life that allows us to do these three things in their maximum amount. Now, I actually applied this to one of my businesses when I was at the multiple million dollar per year level. So, this works at every level, by the way. I wanted to get to the next level, but I had a mansion and a Lamborghini at the time, which I no longer had. This is all AI, by the way. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I want to keep those rumors circulating. But at the time, I had a really expensive lifestyle. And before I built my multi-nigure company, I wanted to get to the point where I could build on those companies. And I needed to be able to take more risk and focus more. So, I actually sold all my furniture, all my possessions, and just moved into an empty apartment with a bed and worked for a couple years. And that's kind of how I built my company. Gave me all the focus and the ability to take risk because I had no longer any overhead lifestyle to pay for. So you want to think about the same way if you're starting a business or you want to just make extra money as well is you need these three things to do it. So why do people fail at getting good at making money? Well, they don't have the time. They don't have the ability to put in the time. They're spending all their time at work. They can't focus because when they get done with work, there's a thousand other things stealing their focused attention. And then they can't take any risk whatsoever. And to make money, you're going to have to spend money and invest in your skills or your business. You're going to have to take small risk with money. You're not going to have to go and bet your entire life savings to start a business. But you're going to need to consistently be able to throw down money here and there to try out new things and experiment. It's just how it is. And so when you have people that have no focus, time, or the ability to take risk, of course they're not going to get good at making money because this is what you need to practice. And you need to practice to get good. So how the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do we do this? What you want to do if you want to make a lot of money is adopt minimalization of your life. This is especially effective in your 20s when you have room to do this. As you add more things to your life, kids, a wife, people that count on you, this gets harder and harder to do, which is why I tell people to just kick their 20s down the road and get good at making money in your 20s so you can just do whatever the hell you want for the rest of your life. It's very hard to start doing this when you're 35, 40 plus. But you still can. You just have to focus on these cores right here because again, our goal is to get good. And if we practice enough, we will get good. And so what we need to do is be able to practice with maximum intent. And these are the things that go into it. So, first we need time to practice. And the way we achieve all these things is through minimization. Because the reason why most people can't do any of these things is their lifestyle and their job and then their environment that they live in. So, for example, they're going to spend 10 hours a day at their job, whether it's at the job and commuting back and forth. Their focus is going to be dragged away by all sorts of stuff going on in their life. And their ability to take risk is going to be hamstrung because their lifestyle requires tons of time. So, if you're young, let's look at how we can get all of these all at once. So, how do we free up our time and also give ourselves the ability to take risk? We have to keep our lifestyle incredibly, incredibly cheap. Sell all your stuff. You should be living in a room with just a bed and a computer. Do you not like that? Of course, nobody likes that. You have to live like an extreme poor person. That's fine because that's going to allow you to work less hours and free up as many hours as you possibly can and then take risk because you need as little money as possible for your lifestyle. So, let's look how this would look if we're a young 20some year old dude or anybody. So, what we wouldn't want to do, you just move to freaking Wyoming or move to a college town and split rent with three other guys. I'm sure things are not as cheap as when I was in my 20s, but comparatively, you could move into a place with three other guys and you could be paying $500, $1,000 per month rent. You can move to Wyoming and literally just be paying nothing in rent. And then what you want to do is go and live next to a grocery store, preferably a gym as well, so you can work out, so you can just walk everywhere. You don't need a car. So, you have no use for any amount of money because your life is so damn cheap. What is this going to allow you to do? It's going to give you tons of time, extra time when you're not working for somebody else to work on your business or your ability to generate cash or improve your skills so you can get paid more at work. You can make a lot of money as an employee. I have multiple millionaire and even 8 figure millionaire people that have worked for me at my companies due the equity and what they were able to earn at the company. So, don't get me wrong, like you can make a lot of money as an employee, but what this will allow you to do is give you the time to then start working on your skill set and getting good in practicing. It also allows you to take risk when you think about, hey, do I need to start this agency? Do I need to buy this website? Do I need to start building or adding inventory for my drop shipping store? This is going to allow you to go and throw money at it. And guess what? When you first start your businesses or try to make money, you're not going to make money right away. It's like when you start shooting the basketball and basketball, you're not going to be shooting three-pointers right off the bat. That's fine because now you can take risk because your rent is so extremely cheap. If I had my way, I would actually just move to Thailand and I moved next to a Muay Thai studio with a grocery store nearby and then you can get all your manly yucks in all you want. You can go work out the Muay Thai studio. You can walk to the grocery store and your rent is like $50 and all the women there are completely fine if you're a broke loser. Heck, if you even want more excitement in your life, some of the girls are even guys. So, you never really know what type of bag of tricks you're reaching into which adds a whole another layer of complexity. Not only can you come home to your family in America saying, "Hey, look, I'm rich, but maybe I banged a dude, maybe I didn't." That's the type of spice you want in your life. Trust me, that's why you watch this channel. Alex Becker's business channel, how to get rich and maybe bang a dude. Soon to be banned off YouTube. But jokes aside, you can move to another country where it's extremely cheap and do this even more effectively. The lower you get your lifestyle, the less you have to work for that lifestyle, the more you can practice your business, the more risk you can take. Now, with that in mind, what you then want to do is achieve focus. So, how you achieve focus? So, if you're 20 years old and your friends are hitting you up and everybody has access to your phone and your parents are hitting you up 24/7 and you also have a video game addiction and you drink consistently and you have your phone and Tik Tok and you have an active Instagram, whatever, and you're in the Mario Kart Reddit forums complaining about the $20 price increase all the time and you're on Twitter 24/7. You're a distracted [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So, if you're trying to get really good at basketball, I want you to think about this. Say we have like two pies right here. We have all your focus. And if we just remove all these other things, like let's let's imagine this pie is split 500 different ways, okay, between all the things I just mentioned. What would happen if we just got rid of all those things and we just made it basketball? Even your short little hobbit ass would get good at basketball, at least copy enough to be dunking on those those amateurs on the amateur court next to your house. So, what you want to do is not only do you want to move away to some place that's really cheap, you want to move away from someplace where you have no access to your family or your friends. And then what you want to do is you want to block all these nasty little addictions you have. For example, on my phone, I load it up and there's a picture of something I want to buy as a goal to motivate me. And then I have no access to Instagram. I have no access to YouTube. I have no access to Slack. I cannot get on Twitter. I literally locked all the URLs of every social media behind a passcode on my phone. And then I hid the phone passcode somewhere in my house. So, of course, I can use an emergency, but I cannot scroll or do any of this on my phone. On my computer, I have all social media blocked by this app that I cannot delete on my computer. So, I cannot access social media. I don't have trouble playing video games anymore, but I used to. The way to get around that is you have a computer that can't run video games. You have trouble watching TV, don't have a TV in your house. Do you see where I'm going with this? What you want to do is you want to forcefully separate everything that's distracting you from basketball out of your life. just get it out of there. You can have it in the future, though. I don't think you're going to be happier playing video games and using social media 24/7 and having a drinking habit. I think getting really good at what you want to do, having a lot of money, and having complete control of your mind is going to make you happier. But don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] listen to me. Look, if you want to go back to binge drinking, playing World of Warcraft on the weekends, and talking to dudes, pretending to be girls on Only Fans, by all means, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it. Remember, this video is not for the exceptionals of you. You only want to make a couple hundredk a year. Trust me, you can still be a raging piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I was a raging degenerate while I was making a couple million dollars per year. Binge drinking and throwing trash cans off roof kind of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] back in the day and I still did it. So you have you probably can too. But the point is right here that we want to get to a point where we have money handled. And the way you do that is by again coming back to this trifecta that I talked about before. We need to give oursel time to get good. We need to be able to take risks consistently to get good because that's how you practice business. And we need absolute focus so we can get rid of all the nonsense in our life at the same time. You do these three things right here and then you pick any business model. And I mean any business model off the top of my head. E-commerce, drop shipping, consulting for businesses, building an agency where you do marketing services for agencies, selling info products, teaching something. Hell, go make some make money online products. And don't even make any money. Just start making make money online products. It works for a lot of people on YouTube. Why not do it, too? I don't care if you're a piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] In fact, I encourage you to go maybe bang Thailand lady boys a few minutes ago. So obviously my opinion of your moral compass really isn't the point of this video. But jokes aside, any business model you see on YouTube right now, selling AI to businesses, whatever, go just do it. And through those things that removal I talked about, that energy you're going to get towards practice, even if you pick the wrong business model at first, it's like in World of Warcraft. You pick the wrong class, but you're playing for 15 hours a day, you're going to reach a level of compensated you'll just pick another class and dedicate that time and energy you you put into it into that class and learning or whatever. It doesn't really matter what class you pick at the beginning of the entrepreneur game. You just get going. It's all basketball. It's all learning to think about business and take risk. And so what you do, like I said before, any business model works. It's about how you practice the sport you're deciding to play. And that's through giving yourself time to practice, the ability to practice it to its full extent by taking risk, and the ability to focus on it by removing everything from your life right there. You will get good very, very quickly. I guarantee it. There is no way you don't get good at business in a year if you're operating this way. Are you going to be as good as me? No. I've been doing this for 15 years. Are you going to be as good as some of those kids who come in and have been building websites since they were 15 years old and made their first million when they were 16 and are billionaires by 22? No, you're not. But to make a couple hundred,000 per year and even get up to the seven figures mark. You don't particularly have to be special talented or doing anything unique. You can be doing what everybody else is doing. You just have to be good enough to play on the court. You don't have to be a star player in college. You don't have to be an NFL player. You just have to be that guy who can come and dominate the local pickup basketball game, which you can do. And this is the big confusion people have because your parents didn't know how to make money. Probably no one around you knows how to make money. And so it's just this big mysterious thing that people think because it's so deeply tied to their ego. There must be some big crazy hard spiritual journey that has you have to go through to learn how to make money when it's really it's just like playing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] basketball. Once you want to get to the seven figure levels, the higher levels and that, you're going to have to learn how to play a lot better and you're going to have to really start thinking about what you're doing. But not right now. If you want to see how to get to seven figures, heck, even $10 million per year. I have videos on that below. And again, I don't sell you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] If you want to see the techniques I use in my businesses, the ads, the copywriting, the sales methods, it's all on this channel. Again, I'm not selling you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] If you do like these videos though, like I said earlier in the video, be sure to subscribe. I'm able to scrape all my subscribers. I'm going be releasing a free course in the future. for all my past courses and everything I've ever released to all my subscribers. If you don't want to subscribe and if you don't want to subscribe, I don't like you and I'm not giving you anything. So, do that. Like this video. I'll see you next video. Goodbye.

TITLE: I Made $200 Million Abusing This 1 Rule (Kinda Regret It)
VIDEO ID: 7VzKIJbLOfk

================================================================================

So, at the time of shooting this video, at least according to this article, my net worth is $170 million plus. Now, I think if you toll up my software companies and my portfolios, it's quite a bit higher than that. But that's not the point. This will serve the purpose of this video. And I'm not here to brag. As you can tell, I'm extremely humble. I've won most humble business advice guy on YouTube for 6 years straight. Not about to break that streak. So, we'll just use that number because, frankly, this video is about you and you getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich, which let's be straight. That's the goal here. You don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about me. So, let's focus on you. And what I want to give you is the number one lesson, the number one piece of advice I can give you in 10 minutes that will help you do just that consistently. And in fact, I wish id learned this a lot sooner and viewed it this way cuz I would have stopped [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up so much. See, the good news for you is I'm an absolute goddamn [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm 37 years old. In the 15 years I've been in business, I have made this one little mistake. And if I just fix this one little thing, just focus on this one golden rule, I would have grown so much faster. In fact, I'd probably be a billionaire by now. Like I said, I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] idiot. I'm really dumb and it took me forever to learn this rule. So, if you can just take this one rule right now, no matter where you are, you are going to grow much faster than I did. And you're going to see everything you want coming a lot faster because this is the golden rule for everything. I wish I'd learned it sooner. I'm just going to give it to you now. And you should listen cuz this is probably going to cut like 5 years off your time to actually learn how to make a lot of money. And number one, I've actually done this. I'm not some business advice guy who's just on here teaching business advice because his business is business advice. And I also have no course to sell you or some law of attraction workbook that change your life now. I'm just a dude in his garage trying to help other dudes in their garages not be as stupid as me. So please listen up. Here is exactly how you get rich. Here's exactly how you make a lot of money. It's the same exact way as every other skill set out there. Let me explain. So here's the thing about money. It's deeply attached to people's egos and emotions. And because of this, they disconnect it from every other skill set out there. For example, if I taught you or wanted you to learn how to play guitar, how you get better at guitar is pretty damn simple. You pick up a guitar, you play it, as you improve, you increase the difficulty. But there's a lot of weird things that come with making money that make people not work in this way. What are these? The first is it's deeply connected to your view of yourself and your ego and how others view you, or at least how you think others view yourself, which is much more important to you than what they actually think. Nobody actually gives a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what other people think of them. They give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what they think other people think of them because that's how they view themselves. So if you think other people view you as a failure, then you view yourself as a failure. Most people don't think about you at all or care about anything going on in your life. So you really shouldn't care about what they think. That's a whole other video for a whole other time. On top of that, money and the making of money comes with one thing that most other skills don't. For example, if you're learning jiu-jitsu, you're learning guitar, you're playing a video game, there's one little nasty thing that comes with making money, and that's risk. And people don't like risk. It makes them very uncomfortable. So when you take these two things, the emotional connection that people have with their view of themsel and money and two risk, which is basically gambling with that view of yourself, people get very very uncomfortable with money and leveling up in money takes being more exposed to those levels of risk. Thus, people don't do it and they view it as a completely different thing. They view it as like something you have or you do not have. And this is why people get very resentful about it because they view it as some form of luck or some like thing that some people get and some people don't get. And the truth is, people just don't apply this damn rule I'm about to give you that you can apply to virtually every other skill set to get good at it, but they don't apply it to money. And so, here's what you need to understand and get past. Making money and getting good at making money is exactly like any other skill. You just have to identify the parts of it that result in higher net worth and growing net worth. Let me explain. So, look, making money intrinsically is no different than any other skill. For example, like playing guitar or jiu-jitsu. So, in the last 3 years, I've learned jiu-jitsu. I put in probably like 600 700 Matt hours, gone in my blue belt and in less than a year, which was pretty fast for most people. But again, I was doing it every single day for hours every single day. And I've also taught myself to play guitar. Now, I'm not going to say I'm world class at any of these. I have the athletic ability of a malnourished chimpanzee. And frankly, I think I've actually gotten pretty good at guitar, but that's not the point. The point is that I've witnessed myself getting better at things and been able to encapsulate it by comparing it to these things. So bear with me. I'm going to make those references like a thousand times in this video and talk about my adult bathrobe karate wrestling experience and so forth. But look, making money is just like these things. If I'm going into jiu-jitsu, for example, when you first do it, the most important thing with jiu-jitsu or any skill set whatsoever is you just go and get on the damn mat. That that's it. You just go and practice it. And then what you do as soon as you learn the basic moves, you get good at it, you start going and wrestling or fighting other people, whatever you want to call it, sparring with other people. and you then look at what you're doing badly and then you focus on doing it better and then you keep increasing the difficulty. So, for example, when you first start your wrestling or you're you're sparring against other white belts, as soon as you get to the point where you're doing pretty well against them, what you want to do is you want to go and up the difficulty and start sparring with other blue belts and then so on and so forth all the way up to black belt. Same exact thing plays to guitar. So, if you're going to play guitar, first thing you're gonna do is you're going to pick up the damn thing and you're gonna get going. And then what you're going to do with guitar, and trust me, again, this all ties back in the money. This is going to be the most impactful thing you ever learn. You just have to put up with my little speech here for a few more minutes and it will all make sense. So, if you're playing guitar, once again, the most important thing, you pick up the damn thing and you get going. Now, once you learn how to play your first song, maybe like Nirvana, uh, Teen Spirit, which everybody learns how to play first. You don't just keep playing that same song over and over again. You play something harder. You maybe learn a solo and you keep pushing and you keep pushing it. So, you go play a harder song and then you just, if you're like me, you just skip to try and play Van Halen and Polifia uh two weeks into it. That's really the best way to do it. But you skip to harder songs and then what you do once you're not good at those harder songs, you just do it over and over again until you're good at them. And then what you do when you get good at that is you go to play a harder song and you do harder techniques and you learn new things and you keep increasing the difficulty. This is common [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sense. If you look at a skill encapsulating getting better at it, it's that simple. I know what you're thinking. Well, duh, of course, but this isn't like making money. No, you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] baboon. It's exactly the same thing. The reason why people are bad at making money and they view it differently is there's a bunch of really weird discomforts that come with starting it. So, I want to talk about making money all the way from getting started to maybe making your first $100,000 a year, $200, $300,000 a year. By the way, this applies to being an employee as well. You can get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] loaded as an employee. I have employees at my company's net worth are approaching eight figures. So, don't think that you have to start a business. This isn't some channel where I'm like, "You got to start a business or your life sucks." That's just what people tell you so that you buy their courses. You can make so much money being a CTO or a COO or very talented salesperson. So, please, this applies to everything when it comes to making money. Now, the thing that comes with making money that separates it from these other skill sets that makes getting hard at it uh mysterious when it's not is because people have a bunch of doubts right here. And so what I'm going to talk about is not just getting started, but going from maybe being having a net worth of a million dollars to two, five, 10, 20, $100 million. Here's the journey and where people get caught up. Because a lot of people plateau. They get to a million dollar $2 million net worth and then they can't make any more money than that and they don't know why. This is why. So the main reason why people don't get started with making money is again those two things I talked about. There is risk and their personal view of themsel. If they go and get started and it doesn't work, other people will think that they're a failure. Thus, they will think they're a failure. Again, other people don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] what you're doing. Nobody cares about you. Look at your daily thoughts. How many times have you thought about how well your friends or someone you know is doing in business other than comparing yourself to them? Probably very little because you're a self-centered little creature, which is fine. We all are. It's it's cool. But that's why people don't begin because they they have to risk that fragile little ego view of themsel. And then you have to constantly experience risk and leaving your comfort zone. So when you play guitar, you're playing a video game or even uh when you're doing jiu-jitsu or any other type of skill set out there, leaving your comfort zone isn't that hard. For example, if I'm playing Doom Eternal on my computer and I increase the the difficulty, the nightmare mode, and I die a whole bunch of times, I don't really hate myself for it. It's not that scary. So you can just go and keep trying over and over again without any problem. Guitar, you play a song wrong, that that's fine. You just pick it up and do it again the next day. It's not like Dobby from Harry Potter just poofs in, kicks you in the nuts, and pepper sprays you every time you mess up. No, there's no risk. But when you increase the difficulty in business, it's very uncomfortable because you have to go from a place where you're kind of comfortable or you're happy at a place where you're not and then have to put on this risk and this chance of hurting your poor little ego over and over and over again. So, it keeps capping people out. So, what happens when people start business? one, they never get started in the first place because of that initial little they don't start a business. They don't start improving their skill set. They don't start learning new things because again, they can't tolerate the risk and the threat to their ego. Then what happens even if they do get started, they start making money. Let's say they get to like $1 million a year in income or let's just say even like $500,000 a year. They go up here, they get to $500,000 a year and then they plateau. Why? Why does this happen? It's because it's like if you're going in a weight room. If you go in and you start doing bench press, your bench press is going to increase very quickly. But pretty soon, you're going to get to the point again where you have to start putting on weight that you struggle with and then you're weak all over again. But unlike in going to the gym, you already have seen a noticeable result that makes you attractive to the babes. In business, a lot of times for the first year or two, you don't start seeing muscle coming on. You don't start seeing results. And then to hop to another next muscle level or wealth level, you have to throw away that all over again and put yourself in the same beginner situation you were before, which everybody hates. Which is why when people get to a level like say 500k a year, a million dollars net worth or something like that, what happens is they plateau and then slowly decline. Because what happens is they get super comfortable right here. They get somewhat happy and then they they stop learning. they stop doing the thing I'm about to show you that helps you keep growing because again they have to take on risk and threaten their ego. So understand these two things. You have to understand them to realize why you're stopping yourself and you're not growing. Then once you understand these, you just have to simply ignore them. They're not important. It's irrelevant. They don't factor into any other skill. Why do they factor into this skill? And if you want to debate me on those things, again, back to point A and point B. You're just worried about what other people think about of you and you're worried about leaving your comfort zone because you're kind of comfortable where you are. If you're making 200k a year at a job, 100k a year at a job, you don't want to risk that. But you have to because that's how you grow. So looking at this situation right here, what business is is a is a range of skills just like any other skill. What I think it mostly is is understanding how to take constructive risk and then how to identify things you need to get good at and work on them. Okay. So, there's a whole other range of things like managing and and or buying ads or uh building software. There's all sorts of little skill sets in business that you get better at. That's not the point right here. What you need to do first off if you're beginning is you just get started. What's the most important thing if you're learning jiu-jitsu? Get on the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] mat. What's the most important thing if you're playing guitar? Pick up the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guitar and play it every day for a few hours. What's the most important thing if you want to get good at a video game? I know a bunch of you neck beard 5 foot2 midgets who watch this channel. little incelss that live in your mom's basement. I know you're good at video games, so there's you apparently can get good at something. You probably beaten some video games or gone to a very high level at that. So, you like every other being on Earth is capable of getting good at something. It's just you're not doing it here. What's the most important thing in the game going at a video game? You play the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] game. So, if you want to get rich, first thing you need to do is just get on the damn mats. You need to get on the court and you need to start playing as much as you can because what then happens? You start developing skills and interest naturally. As you start playing guitar, you're going to start learning music you like to play. You're going to start trying to play that music, and you're going to start learning the skills that come with that music. For example, if you're playing a Nirvana song like Teen Spirit, you're going to get very good at muting, playing chunky bar chords, and playing extremely simple baboon level solos. You're going to learn how to move your fingers around, use all your fingers. All these skills will just naturally pop up. You don't have to sit down like, "Today I will learn how to m move my fingers and mute the" No, you just play the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] song and it will all come right there. Same thing with jiu-jitsu. You get on the mat, you start rolling around, you're not going to know anything. You're going to be super uncomfortable. If someone's going to be like putting in arm bars and choking you all the time, but you're gradually going to learn like, hey, I don't like being choked, so here's how I get out of this choke. Or when a person's on this position, this is how I should move my legs and position myself. It's just going to come. And so, this part is actually the easiest part. If you keep your finances extremely low, you can basically mitigate the number one thing that you're looking to avoid right here, which is risk, which is losing all your money. There's ways to start businesses and there's ways to get in the business and start learning things without taking much risk. You can start at a little Shopify e-commerce store. You can start selling contracting services. For example, when I first got started, I would sell little SEO services to businesses. Very simple skill to learn. And it just took me calling them on the phone, reaching out to them. Now, what happened when I was doing that? I learned the basics of learning SEO first off, but how to sell to people, how to manage customers, how to do billing systems, all the basic stuff. All those skills just naturally happen. And so if you're starting this, I want you to focus on this. It's not any different than any any other skill. You just start trying. Now, you don't need to go and take massive risk to start a Shopify store, to start selling the local businesses. Heck, even just become a sales rep at some company or whatever. It doesn't take much risk. You're not going to go bankrupt doing these things. So, just don't don't do that. Okay? So, you might you learn how to balance the risk first off. That's the most important skill set when you're getting started. Now, here comes the part that everybody messes up. You must always increase the difficulty. If you go to if you start learning jiu-jitsu and then you go and get on the mats and you learn the basics and then you only roll with beginners and you just start stomping these people over and over again, you're not going to get better. You're going to be very comfortable. No one's ever going to be choking you. You're always going to be winning and everyone's going to go, "Wow, he's the best weight belt in the gym. Oh my god." But you're never going to be able to beat up anybody that actually knows what they're doing. You're definitely never going to improve. If your goal is to sit at that level forever, congratulations. You're a low-level bathrobe adult karate expert. Congratulations. But we want to get to the point where we're actually really kicking some ass. And this is where people mess up. And this is where you're going to get stopped at. And it happens at various levels. People start making an extra 10,000 a year, 50,000 a year. At some point, you get comfortable. And what you need to do is the same exact thing you'll do in any other skill set. If you're playing guitar and you learn that Nirvana song, okay, you can you can play Teen Spirit. It's time to go and look at some harder music. Go find Van Halen or Metallica or something like that and start learning to play that as well. Go learn some jazz. I don't I don't know. Go learn how to play what what in the butt on guitar. The world's your oyster. Go nuts. You just need to keep improving the difficulty so that you're no longer comfortable. And that's the hard part because in every other skill set, leaving your comfort zone isn't that uncomfortable. In business, let's imagine you just got to 100k a year in business or whatever skill set you're learning and improving at, you now have to risk that money that you just made, which is giving you comfortability. And you have to risk your new fragile ego, which is that of a semisuccessful person to get to the next level. This is where people mess up and this is where I messed up. For example, when I first got to my first $2 million a year, this allowed me to essentially buy everything I wanted. I moved into a mansion. I got a a Lamborghini. That one was orange back then. And I plateaued for like 5 years. Why? Because I was super duper comfortable. And I kept doing the same exact business types and business strategies and and risk levels that I'd been doing for those 5 years. And I just didn't grow. I didn't grow at all. And I got stuck there. And I didn't understand why. And this is why. Because what you must then do again is you must stack more risk and you must up the level of challenge of the work you're doing. For example, at that point in time, I knew how to sell SEO to businesses. I knew how to launch SEO softwares and and little info procs for them, but I didn't know how to run advertising. I didn't know how to build really highlevel software. I didn't know how to build high investment software. I didn't know how to raise money. I didn't know how to build an executive site. But I didn't do any of those things because I liked making $2 million a year. I liked being semi- rich. I enjoyed it. And I thought to myself, compared to all my friends and people that I know in my general vicinity, I'm very, very successful. But compared to people that actually bust their butt and people that are actually on the court trying to win here, that's not any level of success in business. At least for me. I currently make more in a month than I used to in a year. Actually double that some months if we're looking at everything I'm doing altogether. But I didn't get to that point where I was doing that for a very long time because I got cozy and I stopped putting more weight on the bench press. And so if you're plateauing right now, what you need to do is you need to look at what you're doing. Are you doing the same thing over and over again? Are you taking more risk? If you're not growing, that is why because what business is in a nutshell is again taking risk and doing bigger, harder levels of work. So the second you feel yourself getting to a point where you're competent in business, competent any type of making money, you must go and expand it. So a really good example of this is like say you start off on Fiverr, all right? and you're just selling like graphic design services. Okay, so you start off on Fiverr, then you start selling graph design or maybe AI agents. You're building AI agent. That's really popular right now. Let's use that. So you're building AI agents for people on your own. Maybe you're selling agents from the new airrock on Hyros. Wink wink. But look, you're starting off, you're selling AI agents to people one-on-one like that. So as soon as you get to the point where you're making 100K a year on Fiverr, what a lot of people do is they'll just like stop and they'll like try and like do this more. They'll try and charge more. They'll try and squeeze more water out of this rock right here. No, no, no, no, no. What you want to then do is you want to hire a staff of people and have them building the AI agents when all you do is you focus on selling. Okay, that's a little bit more of a risk because then you're having to actually hire staff and pay them money. Oh, that's starting to get hard. Okay, so now you're making like 300k a year. Very cool. A lot of people get stuck right here. Then what you need to do is you say, "All right, how can I expand this business even more? I need to get more customers." Then you start running ads while paying other people to make the AI agent. So you expand it. Okay, now you're at 500K a year. All right, a lot of people get stuck right here. Then what do we do? We make our own AI agent software or we start bit targeting enterprise businesses. And at every one of these steps right here, I'm not going to map out the entire I can't even see. Look, this is who you're getting advice from. I can't even spell enterprise interpisible. All right, but look at each of these stages right here. You're going to feel [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid again and you're probably going to lose money and it's not going to work. you're going to get to like 300K and you're like, "I don't really want to run ads. I don't want to lose money." You're going to run ads. None of them are going to work. And you're suddenly at the point again where you're a failure and you suck again. You're not doing well. You're like, "Ah, great. I just made 300K, but I just lost 150K trying to run ads." Good. That is the price for growth in business. If you want to excel in business, the suffering, the pain that you feel in the weight room, the the suffering and pain that you feel in the jiu-jitsu mat, the frustration you feel when you can't play that song over and over again, that is risk. That is loss. that is dealing with gain and loss, which is what business and growth is when it comes to making money. It is balancing and manipulating growth and loss cuz that's all you're doing to get edges on other people and find inefficiencies in the market and basically make something for less than it makes you to make it and then sell to them. And so you start adding a lot of things into that. You you started with just working with your own time. That was what you're selling. Now you're selling other people's time. Now you're managing advertising and the attraction of time. Now you're even taking a lot of money and investing it in the product itself or improving that. And so you're constantly taking bigger swings and every single time you go forward. It's the same thing like playing guitar. If we learn guitar, you're going to skyrocket at first because you can play Nirvana. And then you try to play Van Halen and you're bad again. And you go back down. Then you can learn to play Van Halen. Then you maybe start playing some polifia or some of that Gen Z music and you're like, "Oh my god, this is terrible." And then you get good at that. And then you're like, "Fuck, maybe I'll go learn, I don't know, jazz." And you're like, "Ah, this is lame boomer music. This is terrible." And you get really bad again. And you go back up again. And this is how you grow in business. You have to keep increasing the difficulty. Every single time you're wondering, how do I get richer? You need to look at what you're doing. If you're starting from zero, you need to get on the damn court so there's at least some difficulty or something going on. As soon as you get on the court and you start being able to make three-pointers, you start be able to choke someone in jiu-jitsu. You start being able to play your your first songs, you have to say, "Okay, this is great, but I'm going to have to go back down the mountain and climb it again and increase the weight." And if you do this consciously and aggressively every single time for years, you will get rich. I guarantee it. Because what you're doing is the essence of how people get rich but don't talk about it. And that is treating it like any other skill set. What business is is being able to make really good decisions, manage risk, and all the little subsklls below it. It's not some lottery where you just go and push buttons and some get lucky and some don't. The reason why, for example, if you look like Alex or Mosie, you could find videos of Alex all the way back to like forever ago, where he's just like a little newborn elf making gym videos in like a dimly lit room. The reason why Alex is so damn good at business and the videos and he's grown his businesses so far, if you've seen his recent stuff he's doing, very cool, is because Alex kept increasing the damn difficulty over and over again. What he's doing at acquisition right now is leagues more challenging than what he was doing at gym launch. And he had to go and take huge steps back to actually go and build acquisition. What I'm doing at Hyros right now of my companies right now is billions of times more complex than what I was doing when I was selling SEO services. And in order to go and take that leap to Hyros, for example, when I was really frustrated at $2 million a year, I actually sold all my so I didn't have to worry about money or risk at all. Moved into a completely empty apartment and built my software company then. And while I wasn't broke by any means, I removed all the fear of risk and all the discomforts right there. Stopped caring what people thought about me, which again was me thinking about what they thought about me. No one was actually thinking about me whatsoever. And I focused on being able to take more risk and grow my skill set. As soon as I started doing that, I started going back up the mountain again. My net worth grew past 9 figures very quickly. Honestly, in the span of years, and my income shot from a million, $2 million a year to making over $2 million a month. And that's what I'm trying to convey to you right here. And that people don't get what I just conveyed to you is a very, very simple statement. Find a skill. Keep increasing the difficulty. Every time you hit the point where you're satisfied with where you are, throw it all away and increase the difficulty more. This is the most common sense thing ever. But people have this weird view of money, this weird view of wealth that won't let them do that. And so when they get plateaued, they keep trying to find ways to grow without taking more risk or without being uncomfortable. Again, when they're getting started, they're thinking, "How do I build a business without taking risk or being uncomfortable?" You don't. As soon as they start making more money from that, they get past that little irky thing. and they're like, "Okay, that was that was hard, but now that I've made it, I don't want to go back to taking risk and being uncomfortable ever again." Guess what? You got to. As soon as you're making 100K, 200k a year, you throw it all out the window. You you take the dice, you head back to the casino, and you do it again. And you're going to lose and you're going to lose and you're going to lose until you get good enough that you can win. And as soon as you start winning again, back to the casino. Lose, lose, lose, win, win, win, lose, lose, lose, win, win, win. And that, my little internet buddy, is the most effective rule, the most effective talk I can give you in 20 minutes about how to get rich. If you just do that one thing and apply that rule over and over and over again, it will all work out. Because no matter what happens, no matter what skill you're trying to learn, you're constantly going to get much better at it. And those risks you take and those things you mess up, you're going to learn from them. And you're not going to make that same mistake again. And then you stop making so many mistakes. And then you start winning. And then you just repeat the process over and over again as fast as you possibly can. What most people do is they take it very slowly. They they try they get to a certain point, then they try to do it without being comfortable, not taking risks again, and they say, "Oh shit." And then two years later, they do it. A really smart person hits that wall and immediately throws it all away, does it again. If you look at Mr. Beast, for example, when he was growing his videos, as soon as he made any money from his videos, he took all that money, threw it back in the videos, and started making even crazier videos. As soon as he made money from that, all the money into it, constant discomfort. That's why he's a billionaire. That's why I'm not a billionaire. because as soon as I got to a level of wealth, I kept the money and tried to be comfortable. Don't do that. That's it. If you like videos like this in the channel, I'm going to be making a lot more general videos on this channel because uh I'm tired of making ad videos because you can only learn so much about ads. If you like that, you should like and subscribe. And if you want to see ad videos, there's still a few laying around right here in the suggestions. though. Okay. Bye.

TITLE: I Explain Weird FB AD Niches That Made Me $32k A Day

================================================================================

So making this adjustment in your ads and your landing pages and also your product, it will double or triple your conversions, it can in fact redefine your entire business. And if your business is struggling to scale with ads right now or you're having trouble growing on ads, this will make the ads extremely easy. You will see your ads that are not converting before, not getting customers suddenly getting five times the conversion rates, but six times 10 times the conversion rates in some instances. That's only instances where your ads absolutely suck ass. But still, let's take the win. This will do that because every single day at Hyris, I talk to a lot of our customers who are running ads and a lot of them have trouble scaling past certain importance because all of their competitors are selling the same exact thing and so they're running ads with like 50 other businesses selling the same exact thing. They can only do so much with their ad scripts. They can only do so much with their copy and it's just not scaling anymore because the ads get too expensive. You've probably had this problem with your ads. What I'm going to give you right now is a way to isolate and pivot your business to make your ads convert much much higher at much lower ad spends. If I have to start any business from scratch, this is how I'm going to start running ads because it's just so damn effective and you can actually go and run very tiny ad spends and get massive ROIs doing it. Let me explain how this works. So, look, I'm the CEO and founder of one of the largest ad tracking companies in the world right now, Hyros. I see it's working across billions of dollars ad spend. And I've spent the last 10 years of my life running ads, tens of millions of dollars spent that generate multiple 8 figureure businesses and one nine figure business. So what I'm telling you here isn't coming straight out of my nether region being thrown out of the wall. This is coming from a very well-educated Nether region. So you should try to catch it when I chuck it. Okay? Don't visualize that. But you get the point. And whenever I see businesses running ads or I'm going to start a new business, this technique and how they structure it, they always just perform 10 times better. This is why when you're running advertising, you want to run advertising in a vacuum. This means you want to have the most unique ad possible. Now, most people think that applies just to your creative or your ad copy, but I'm going to be straight with you. There's only so much you can do with your targeting and your ad copy and your creative. Eventually, you know the best techniques and you're getting the you're getting close enough. All right? Improving your ads another 20% is not going to grow your business. What will grow your business is if you're running ads to an audience that is underserved, doesn't see these ads very often. You're selling them a product that they've that's completely unique and specific to them that nobody else is. And you have the absolute best best best best possible offer that is optimized just for them. What does that mean? Let me give you a perfect example of this in in theory. So, back in the day, I'm going to use Alex Emozi as example right here cuz I love what he originally did with this and it's a perfect example for this. It's it's brilliant. So, you may not know that um before Alex did all the acquisition.com stuff, he had this business called Gym Launch. So, back in the day when he was launching Gym Launch, they basically sell consulting and services and advice and info products and whatever for gym businesses, masterminds, basically very typical uh business growth consulting offer. So at that time back in the day, everybody else was running very very similar offers, but they were all running offers for teaching people how to learn consulting, doing consulting or agency services for businesses or e-commerce, make money online. And so everybody in the entire space was all focused around either making big broad make money products, mindset products or or products for e-commerce or agencies or consulting. And so it was very hard to actually run ads for this. I had a business that was generating like 20 $30 million per year give or take depending on the year it did that based on whatever years but it was only at like a 30% profit margin and I was the best of the best of the best of the best at it and I was even struggling to grow the ads and scaled them. So Alex what he did is he created very similar offers but then he took it to a completely different industry that would never seen ads for this ever. So he was running ads for gym businesses. Gym businesses were not getting any advertising for offers like this. Zero. No one was spending any money targeting them on Facebook or anything like that. Alex also built the entire business around this offer. So he was the only one offering this offer and he was really really really effing good at it. So everyone in the gym business knew that he was the one to get results. So he had this entire market which can generate 4050 $100 million a year all to himself. Now the gym consulting business is not like a multi-billion dollar market cap market. It's not that large. But because nobody was marketing to it, nobody was making products for it, Alex was able to take a product that a lot of other people were selling, just the basic uh high ticket course, high ticket program, consulting, and in mastermind model, and he applied it to gyms. And I think the business did like, I don't know, $40, $50 million a year, like 17 $18 million in profit, uh, one of their first years doing this. Boom, breakthrough. So, what's the lesson we can take away from this? When we're running ads in our business, we don't have to necessarily change our business model. But we do do do have to go and actually find businesses and a method and a way of approaching businesses that matches that model, which is finding potential customers that are completely underserved, not targeted on on ads at all. Making a product that no one else is offering is completely unique and then making it the absolute best amazing thing in the space. Then you can carve out your own little niche to start your business and grow. So let me give you a story about a business I launched that failed and how I could have done it better applying this technique. So before I launched Hyros, I launched an email uh business. It was an email kind of similar to Mailchimp or whatever autoresponder because I was very into email marketing. Now I tried to target all small business types with this and it failed. And the reason why is because I was again targeting a big broad niche. Around this time Clavio popped up. It would it started like about a year before us and they did one thing that was different. They only made email marketing for Shopify stores and e-commerce businesses. I believe it was just Shopify back then. By doing this, their results compared to ours absolutely exploded. Why? Because no one was marketing specific email services to e-commerce stores. And then the problem with all of it is we were trying to market to everybody. So, we weren't optimized or perfect for anybody. Clavio was marketing just to e-commerce people who weren't receiving ads for email software. So, their ads hit because they were the only one uniquely selling us. There weren't five different softwares for e-commerce launching at the time and they were the absolute best and the best and the best at it. So as they grew just a little bit, they became known as the e-commerce software for email or the email software for e-commerce. This allowed them to dominate and I believe the company is worth like 7 billion now. My company that I launched then is worth zero because I'm an idiot and didn't realize this technique that they were doing then. So those are two stories about positioning right here. So how can you do this in your business? Look at your business model. If you're launching a software, you're launching a skincare product, you're launching a gym product, you're launching a info product, where can you find audiences that are not being marketed to that this business model will work for? Then, how can you make an absolute unique product where if you're running an ad, there is no one else running a a product just like yours? Finally, how can you be the absolute best in the space so that when you get a foothold, even if people make competing products, it doesn't matter anymore. So, let's go to my computer right now and do some brainstorming. And this is exactly how I would launch a new business or product with ads and absolutely clean house. Now, first before we get going, I have to give you one ad tip that is paramount. It beats all of this right here. If you just apply this one thing, you're instantly going to see more money from your ads. You should um track your ads. I know I say this every single video like five times. But if you track your ads with Hyros, you are going to see much more money. I literally guaranteed or you do not have to pay for hires. Here's how. If you look at our Facebook ad tracking right here, we tracked 195 calls from this ad set in this time period from our Facebook ads, Facebook caught 88. If I was running my ads based on the data from Facebook, I would be turning off ads that are printing money for me. I would be turning up ads that are not making me money. I would be losing money hand over foot for making the wrong decisions. If you are not tracking your ads with something like this, Hyros is the best and it's the only one that sits in your ad manager like this, you are making terrible decisions with your ads and losing money for no reason. So, you should come check out Hyros when this video is done. Put it on your site. If it doesn't get you results, you don't see an increase in revenue like all the businesses are on page. You can see Tony Robbins, Alexi uses this. Playboy, Bodybuilding.com, 5,000 plus other businesses. If you don't see results like they do, you don't have to pay for it, literally. So, come check it out. The video is done. So, let me show you this method applied to one of my businesses. So, back in the day, if you don't know, I used to be one of those make money online guys. I'd sell courses on how to make money online. Now, I was also running software businesses and all sorts of other stuff, but people really wanted to figure out what I was doing in my businesses. At this point in time, I make so much money, just being transparent with you, it's not worth my time to teach anymore. But back then, making a couple extra $100,000 per month or even millions of dollars per month from teaching was very beneficial for signing my software company. So, I taught a lot of what I knew for money. Now, I just give it away for free, which is what you're getting in these videos. But back then, I would sell courses based around advertising, consulting, uh building agencies, and uh selling info and courses because that's what I was really good at. But everybody else in the niche was selling products like this. It was it was extremely jam-packed. And so what I saw is look, everybody knows about e-commerce and Shopify and drop shipping right now, but back in the day, back in the old wild west of internet marketing, that was a really new thing. And so when I saw that happening, no one was running ads or building courses or making webinars particularly for that. So what I did is, you're probably thinking in this video right now, how do I change to a completely different niche or how do I pivot my business model to another niche? Here's what I did. I found two people who were experts in e-commerce and were getting really, really good results and then basically told them to make a course and I told them exactly what to put in the course, how to train people, etc. And so I took all my knowledge from this business model up here and I imported it to them. I made them partners at the business for a smaller percent. I believe I had 70% of the business than they got 30%. And I said, "Okay, this is going to work way better because there's no one running an offer like this. It's extremely unique right now. It wouldn't be in today's age, e-commerce, Shopify, teaching products are nothing new. And then we're going to run ads to this. And so I stopped running ads in the competitive market space with a product that was like everybody else's. And I made this. Instantly, the product went to well over 1 mil a month in sales. We had many days we're breaking $100,000 a day. Easy peasy. And so this turned it into a near $20 million per year business overnight. And all I did, I didn't change my advertising tactics. I didn't change my business model. I really didn't change any of my funnels or my copyrights or scripts. I just pivoted and marketed to a audience that was being underserved with a unique product that was best in its class because we had the best e-commerce or result guys teaching it inside the product. That's how simple that was. That one change right there made me more money on an info product than I've ever made in info products before. So, how do we do this in your business? Okay, so you got to look at your business model. I'm not saying if you're selling info products or whatever, it only applies to that. This applies to everything. Whether you are selling e-commerce products, whether you are selling info, whether you're selling software, you need to look at your niche and you need to really ask yourself, am I selling anything unique in my niche? Do I have a unique sales proposition? You got to be super honest with yourself. Are there 50 other competitors selling something that's pretty much the same thing as yours? If people take their products versus your products, they get pretty much the same results, then you don't have a wide openen category to go and dominate. So you need to look at inside your niche. Are there subniches or part particular types of people that you could market to? Could you, for example, I'm just going to give you general ideas. Could you take your SAS software and make it specialized for doctor's offices or construction companies or hotels? Could you take your info product and could you make it and warp it into a business model that is completely underserved right now? Could you go and find other people to teach your info product or train in your info product to teach and hit an entirely underserved category with an info product that's never been done before? If you're doing an e-commerce product, are there people inside that industry that are being underserved for a particular uh reason? For example, one thing I saw was really good with skincare recently is I saw this isn't anything new now, but originally people started going and marketing the men who were 40 plus years old because there's a whole bunch of men going through a midlife crisis now on YouTube. All us millennials are turning 40 and so we're suddenly having to deal with this aging thing. So they made skincare products like a complete line of products for men who were 40 plus years old. I'm pretty sure that absolutely killed it because they were the only people making something like this. But you can make specific type of products for people with certain skin con skin tones, hair colors, whatever. Find specific types of people that are being underserved and make a product just for that. When you're also starting a business, say this is the entire niche of let's say uh B2B software and let's say we niche it down to like email marketing. What can you do to find one little small subsection of this niche and be the absolute best product in a niche for those people? Because one of the best ways to blow up your business early on is you don't try and go and compete with everybody else. What you want to do is you want to find this subset where it's very easy to dominate. So for example, if you made an email marketing software only for doctor's offices and every single feature in there was targeted to doctor's offices, you would easily beat out pretty much every single other mail software on the market within like 6 months. Is this niche big enough to make you hundreds of millions of dollars a year? No, probably not. But it's definitely enough to make you like five, six, $10 million a year. Easy peasy. And so that's how you go and do this because then you could literally go and buy ad space to doctors that other people are not using. You could find ad space and target them in different ways that's completely unique. And then from all the advertising, they're saying you're probably offering them with something that's very unique and it's the best product in the space and has unique selling proposition. So, this technique right here is literally, I think, one of the most powerful techniques you can use in all of marketing because it allows you to basically hack the system of competition and having to beat everybody and having to have the best ads and allows you to just go in and run ads very, very cheaply that convert super highly and have the entire intention of a small pond, but still have the entire intention of the small pond. And you have to understand whether it's a big pond or not, if it's a big pond, a lot of times the amount of money it costs to reach that pond is very expensive. But you can have a small pond all yourself, but the cost to reach it is onetenth the price um per customer than it is if you're in that big pond. So for example, if you were going after every single person in B2B email marketing, you'd be paying $100 per customer to reach them and you'd have very low conversion rates. If you were paying for specifically an email marketing software for just doctors, you could probably get those leads in cheaper and the conversion rates will be much much much higher because you have a unique product that is the best in the space for them and you're able to reach them with something they've never seen before. This absolutely shits money is one of the most powerful methods there is. When I launched Hyros, what we did in particular is we made tracking for info marketers and digital course businesses. And that's what we really focus on first and we focus on calls and and running particular types of advertising that showed influencers in that space going and making a lot of money using our tracking. And so that's what we optimize for it first. Now we kind of work for everybody because once you go and get into those spaces where you take over the small little niche, then you can use as a foothold to get into the big niches. So this is just a big overall lesson I think is one of the most powerful lessons that people do not understand in marketing. If you want to see the ad scripts, the ad templates, the targeting, my how I test Facebook ads, it's all going to be posted around this video. And there's also links below this video that have all the other trainings in them. It's all free. It's all here on YouTube. I don't have any courses or anything to sell you. Go watch those. It's everything I do. And uh I'll see you next video. Take it easy.

================================================================================

[Music] Well, hey there. So, you are an internet scuzzbach who's trying to sell more of your Scuzbag products through Facebook and Google ads. And in this video, I'm going to give you a structure for your Facebook and Google ads. If you use this, it is going to I guarantee and this is not like a hyperbole like when I actually make headlines in internet marketing, they actually mean something. I know nobody does that, but seriously, listen to this. When I guarantee something, I guarantee it. I guarantee if you use this structure here, you are going to double, triple, quadruple, 10x your ads. And I can tell you that because I've used this to build a multi-figure business that generates me many, many millions of dollars per month and many other businesses that are in the 8 figureure range. It just absolutely works. It just just applied in this video. I know that sounds hyperbolic, but I got the results to back it up. I am the CEO of Hyruis. This is one of the largest ad tracking companies in the world right now. And across all my experience spending tens and tens of millions of dollars on ads, I actually see what is working in the industry. And this little tactic, this structure for Facebook and Google ads, everybody that's doing it is absolutely printing money. Everybody else is getting so so results. Their ads are not scaling. This is going to fix it for you. I virtually literally guarantee it. Now, let me explain how this works because you're probably still skeptical. And yes, I know you're impressed by my new studio. I wanted to create the most depressing office environment possible. I figured the last studio looked way too cool. So, I figured I want to get into a filming environment that looks like a cross between living in my mother's basement and the Chamber of Secrets in Harry Potter. It's a real great place to be. Curb your enthusiasm. Curb your impress. I know this this shooting setup reeks some of success. I just moved. This is the best it's going to get if you came for the special effects in the studio. Not going to happen. We're just going to lower and lower the quality of these videos until it's not even me in the videos. Is it just going to be an AI generated cardboard figure pumping out generic blog marketing information? That's the direction we're heading. Okay. All right. All right. Enough. Look, what the heck are we doing here? Let me explain. See, I do a call a day with an entrepreneur at Hyros. These are businesses. They're running a lot of money on ads. And every single call it is, hey, what's working? Are UGC ads working? Are image ads working? What type of headlines are working? What type of targeting is working? And I got to tell you something. When it comes to paid advertising, yes, having an optimized ad, having optimized headlines, having all the hoopla and the stuff just right, yes, that does get results. That is important. But if you're watching this channel and you run any amount of ads, you probably already know most of the secrets when it comes to ads. You probably can go and make a pretty well optimized ad. And so, you're not going to get the edge by doing that. You're going to get the edge by understanding what the customer is briing not listening to this channel. I can't talk. You're going to you're going to get the results by understanding what the customer's buying and decision makingaking process looks like. Most people mess this up in their ads. In fact, everybody does except for me. I'm the only person in the world to ever nail it. Most people mess this up because they think of ads as some binary thing where we copy some phrases and some lingo and a speaking pattern and that convinces people to buy. No, you have to think about what the person's thinking from the first time they see your ad all the way through. Let me break this down. So, first things first before we get started, I'm going to give you one ultimate ad tip. Track track your ads with an attribution system. Look, I suggest Hires because I own Hires and it's the best tracking possible and it has endless testimonials from like Tony Robbins, Alexi uses it. We have giant brands like Playboy using it. We have a near-perfect score on Trust Pilot. We literally have a guarantee that if you don't make more money using it, you don't have to pay for it. It's a great place to be. But please just track it with something. If you look at our Facebook ads right here, here's me tracking with Hyros. We run a call funnel. the most basic funnel to track of all time. It's just a person clicking on a page and booking a call. And you can see right here, Facebook only caught 42 calls. We're tracking 116 calls right here. If I had been using Facebook's metrics right here, I probably would have turned off these ads or at least think they aren't that successful. I'm paying $500 per call. I'm actually paying $200 per call, which is printing money at my business. I am begging you, if you run ads and watch this video, apply what I'm about to tell you. It's going to double your ad results, but you're not really going to get much traction with your ads if you're not tracking where the sales are coming from and which ads are profitable and how profitable they are. Please, after this video is done, just come stop by Hyros. Check it out. Takes 2 seconds to apply and you're going to be able to actually run your ads so much more efficiently, which will make you more money from what I'm about to teach you right here. FYI, also before we get started, I'm going to mention a lot of ads, Facebook targeting, whatever in this video. On this channel, I give away literally everything for free. All I want to do is just teach you how to make more money from your ads so that you eventually come and track your ads with Hyro. So, I'm just going to tell you everything I know. At the end of this video, you'll have links to the scripts, the ad targeting, everything I'm doing, how I how I target everything on Facebook, exactly what I run ads, the scripts. You'll watch them all. It's all there verbatim. You can also just browse around on this channel. It's literally all here. What we need to focus on this right here is an understanding that when you combine it with those things is going to turbocharge your ads, the scripts, and everything you're using. So, let's dive into it. So look, let me explain this core problem that you're probably making and almost everyone I talk to that runs ads that isn't extremely rich like myself is making. So look, I was talking to a SAS company, but this is across e-commerce across info marketing the other day and I was looking at their ads. I'm like, why aren't our ads converting? We can't make this work. And it's fundamentally un misunderstanding what the customer cares about and how they make their decision-making process. So, let me give you the tip of the iceberg real quick and then we're going to get into a step-by-step six-step proven method that you can use uh that is going to just make your ads crush because you're actually going to dive deep into your customer's brain and extract the thing that makes them do the thing you want, which is buy stuff, optin, book phone calls, or basically believe you're going to be able to solve their problem if they give you money, which is the core thing we're trying to do here. That's that's it at the end of the day. If we can get someone to think if they give us money, their problem will be solved. We've won. But how the heck do we get there? So, I was looking at their ads and from the get-go, their SAS company and their software ads, they said, "Why aren't they converting?" There's two things they were misunderstanding from the get-go. So, they're just running ads saying, "Hey, our our software can do this. It will optimize, let's just say in this instance right here, your emails for you." Okay? And they're they were running all these ads and they're like, "Well, we can't scale the ads because they're not profitable uh right away. Um we we spend $100 and we only get 50 bucks back and we don't know why they're not converting." So, let's look at what's going on right here from the get-go. So, this is part of the process I'm going to teach you. I just want to show you how off people are. What a lot of people are doing with their ads is the first thing you can see that they are doing with the ad is they start talking about what the product does. And that's not what the customer cares about. The only thing a customer cares about when they're buying a B2B software, and I'm going to show you this process for ecom and everything else, but we have to nail down what the customer cares about. The only thing a person cares about in a B2B software is money. So the only thing we should be advertising is the saving or creation of money. If you ever look at high roast ads for example, the only thing I directly connect it to immediately in every single ad, I never talk about tracking in the ads. I talk about the percent increase in the ads you're going to see. I show Tony Robbins going and doubling one of his ad funnels with it. I get all the results from all the cut big companies that come through. I always make sure it focuses or I ask them how much do were you able to scale your ads further? That's why if you go to Hyro site, you just see endless results. not talking about what Hyros does tracking accuracy wise. No one cares about that. What it talks about is how much more money people are making from their ads by using accurate data. And so what they're doing right here is if I was running Hyros ads based around tracking accuracy, which is what a lot of our competitors did back in the day, uh and that's why we absolutely body slam them because they don't understand what their customers care about. So by doing this, one, they don't understand what the customer is looking for. And then two, they don't understand the customer buying process. When a person is buying B2B software, what they do is you alert them to the problem and nobody clicks an ad and just starts buying B2B software like they're buying underwear on the internet. No one's like, "Oh man, this is a cool enter soft underwear. I got to buy it now." That's not how they buy it. What they do is soft underwear. It's the new thing in e-com going to be a giant hit. You heard it here first. But what they do is they get alerted to the fact that they have the problem and then what they do is they think about it for a little bit. They talk to their team and then when they finally decide, hey, this is a problem. We need to solve it, they go and look at the top three different companies. And so the way you want to run e-commerce ads is you want or I mean SAS ads is you want to attach it back to money. And then what you want to do is you want to remember that they're not going to buy right away. And then you want to remarket the hell out of them so that when they do make the decision to finally come and fix this problem, you're sitting there like a Geico commercial when their person thinks about looking for insurance. Okay. So, why did I just explain this whole situation to you? I just wanted to show you a very simple thought process or example of how people are dramatically misunderstanding how their customer is thinking about, looking for and buying their product. This simple little process that I just showed you or this example showed you just this shift in mindset is something that makes our ads at Hyros, which we sell tracking, which is the most boring thing on planet Earth, makes it sexy and something that people buy like crazy. And so the secret to our ads and the reason why my company's ads do very well is not because I follow some script or some pattern or some UGC format with a specific landing page. We literally just send people to our website. It's because what I do is I understand the customer buying process. And so what we need to do when we're looking at our ads is we need to go through some questions and some flows to actually understand what our customer is trying to do and what the buying process looks like. Okay? Okay, so I want to walk you through this. And if you do this general thought process before you start running your ads, you're going to make 10 times better ads. And you're going to think about how your ads are going to work with your customer much better. So look, the first thing we need to think about with our ads is what does the buying process look like? So if you're running an e-commerce business, the buying process looks like a person coming straight to the site and buying right away. If you have a low ticket item, that's what it looks like. All right. So what we're trying to do is we really need to frontload getting this low ticket item sold. So that means using a lot of scarcity tactics, aggressive things, and then following up around this one low ticket product right here. But if we're selling a SAS product, for example, what the buying process looks like is sometimes the customer takes a week or two to buy. They go and talk to their team. They think about it. If we have a really high ticket product, our e-commerce product, the person's probably going to talk to support. They're going to do some research. They're going to go ask, chat, GPT. And so there's all sorts of things you could think about when the person lands on the site that cut them off from those things or help them with those things. putting in little maybe an AI bot that helps them with the chats or whatnot to answer their questions. So, for example, I was looking at like a hyperbaric chamber the other day. That's not something I'm just going to click an ad and be like and then buy it. No, I want to ask questions, but there was nothing on the site to ask questions about. Their chat wasn't responsive. You know how crazy it would have been if I just land on the page and they had just a chat GBT that was trained to answer questions right below the product. I could just ask questions about it. It would have been groundbreaking. But instead, I have to like email them and then wait two like two days to get a response. All sorts of stuff like this is what you need to think about when you're looking at your ads and then think about what the process is going to look like. If you're running a SAS company right here, you probably want to market to the people first and then really focus more on your remarketing. If you're running a low ticket company right here, you really want to focus on your scarcity and all the things that cause a person to buy on their first try because you have to hook them right there. Okay? If you're thinking about something where you're selling something high ticket or a high ticket maybe e-commerce or something like that, think about all the questions and other places they're going to go when they click on these ads. other things they're going to think about. Okay, so I just want you to think about this when before you start running your ads. What does the buying process look like overall? And then you might start thinking, hm, maybe I need to adjust how I look at my ads. For example, I see SAS people running ads the same way that e-commerce people are trying to run their ads or something like that. It it just doesn't work. Okay, so the next thing and really the most important place to start at is what the f do these people want? What the hell do they actually want? What people don't want out of your skin care product is a new cream that feels luxurious on their skin that has a revolutionary acne treatment system attached to it. They don't want that. They want to get rid of their blackheads in 3 days. They want to get rid of their blackheads fast. Okay? And so when a person buys a SAS software, what do they want? They want to make a lot of money. They want to make more money than they pay. They want their business to make more money. When a person buys a hyperbaric chamber, for example, what do they want? They want a h a hyperaric chamber that gets to a certain pressure and has these dials and features. No, they probably want to improve their skin, reduce some certain ailment, something like that. Reverse aging, something like that. That's the thing they want to see. And so, it's very important when you're running ads, you identify this what the f immediately and you focus all your ads on that. You don't focus it on anything else. This is the most important shift you can make in your ads. Everybody out there is advertising their features or the things it does, not the result that people want. So think about this immediately and then zero in on this. Now the next thing you need to consider and that most people don't consider when they have their ads is that people often don't consider themselves that they have this problem especially in B2B. Okay. So, if you're dealing with like skin care or something like that or like health supplements, all the time I see ads and the best ones, for example, um I'm going to give you example of a really good place to just skim around to get ideas for this. If you go skim through Twitter, I am constantly in health Twitter discovering I have new massive problems with my body and I'm taking the wrong supplements. Like every five scrolls, it's like this new breakthrough thing right here is why your liver is on fire or this this new foot bath thing. All this all this kind of stuff, right? I'm constantly discovering there's something new and terrible wrong with my body and there's news this new magic plant in Nicaragua that solves everything like every 10 minutes. And the way every single one of these ads always starts off and it's not so much an ads just people posting on Twitter is by convincing me first off I have the problem in the first place. And so for example I've seen one that was like you know Mark Wahberg had high blood pressure and then he like reversed it using this thing right here. But the craziest thing is like most men over 35 have this crazy chronic thing just like Mark and they didn't know. They don't know that they have it. That gets me paying attention right away. And so what you need to think about with your ads is do people actually know they have the problem? One of the ways to easy easily expand your ads is by being able to target people that don't know they have the problem. So, for example, if people have a wrinkly face, they know they have a wrinkly face, but if they if you can pin other reasons to like why why it's happening, maybe they've accepted it, but they they think they it's there's no way they can solve it. And it could be like it's actually something in your air conditioner that's causing your wrinkly face or something like that. Or for example, when I started running ads, most people didn't think they had a tracking problem. They thought Facebook ads were good enough. And so, I had to convince people that they did have the problem. So, one of the ways that I did this was by first catching their attention with stories, okay? Stories of how celebrities on Hyros fix this problem, okay? And so what I did with this is I attach it to the thing they want. All right? So I show celebrities making more money. Okay? So people think, hm, I want more money. How are they making more money? Then I introduce them to the problem. Okay? And so this is something you just want to do in your ads. You want to think about what the heck does the person want? What's the end result? And then what's the problem that's causing it? And how can we convince them that they have this problem? Almost everybody running ads on Facebook, if I say you have a tracking problem, they don't know they have a tracking problem. Nobody knows they have a tracking problem. I have to make these stupid videos making this content for you to really persuade you and hint at the fact that maybe you should track your ads accurately because if you know where your sales are coming from, it's incredibly helpful if you're throwing money at ads to know which ads are generating sales. But nobody, okay, I'm not even going to get into my rant right now, but you you see what I'm saying right here. So the way I grew Hyros very successfully was by convincing people that they have this problem that they do have. And so when you think about your ads, think first off, what's the buying process look like? What the heck do they even want? And are they even aware they have the problem in the first place? So then the next thing you need to think about with your ads and your landing pages when you're writing copy for your ads or you doing anything is getting the person to the place where they think they need to solve the problem. So how do you do this? You want to show compounding damage after you've introduced the problem to them from these things. So for example, what I would show in hyros ads is the amount of loss stacking up. So for example, if a person had like 100k a month business, um we'd show that they were like losing an additional 20k a month in the ad. Or we'd show excessive results. So companies using it, etc. Because what people are going to do is is you have to either get a person across the line with your ads by showing them massive benefits, massive gain, or massive loss. That's how you have to end every single ad. And so, for example, you really need to like if we have like a skincare or a skin cream ad or something like that, you need to show like a lot of people, like tons and tons of people curing their skin in record time and then say something like, "Come to this page. We'll show you a case study of 500 people, 100 people, everyone getting this result you want in record time." That's how you do the massive benefit. Okay? That's how I would do it at Hyros, for example. I'd say come to this page, you're going to see endless results. Or you need to show the massive compounding damages. So when it's like health products or like a B2B product, the compounding damages of not leaving this or leaving this problem alone, that's going to get people to click on the ads and actually take the action. So what do they want? Convincing them they have the problem and then showing them the massive benefit to convince them that they need to solve the problem or the compounding damage that they're causing by not solving the problem. This is going to get people to come through and actually look at your site and start digging around and doing stuff. And then finally, the last mistake I see with people in their ads, and this is such a simple exercise. Everything I walked you through is just basic persuasion, but people don't think these things apply to their ads. They don't they don't think about it, and they think my UGC ad just wasn't like was didn't have a hot enough babe in it or something. I don't know. Finally, when a person does come to your site, if you want your ads to convert much more at all, here's here's what you need to do. Like, here's how you blow up the conversion of all your ads. You convince them that it works. Okay? I've seen every sales copy, every trick, every page, everything like that. The only thing people really care about is that it works. And so, you can try every trick in the book when it comes to what you're doing. But the number one way you're going to convince people on your pages when people actually land there is by showing results and then backing them up with crazy guarantees. And if you're in terms of health products or supplements or e-commerce or something like that, showing specific studies, stuff like that is going to push you over the edge. The next thing you also have to do is think about making them understand briefly how it works. So once you've convinced people when they land on your page that it works. You need to convince them how it works in the simplest format possible without confusing them. A beautiful example of this is on the Hyros website. If you go look at the top of the website, we have this really simple video right here that shows how the software works without a sales video or anything like that. I don't like sales videos per se because they can get really long and confusing. But what you want to focus on is people don't care how it works. They just want to grasp the concept of how it's going to get them this result. If you tell someone that you're going to get rid of all the blackheads of their on their face in 3 minutes or 3 days, whatever, they're not really going to swing. If you if you show them, for example, um one of the best pitches I saw for skincare products was this combination product where it said, "All right, so the way you're going to get rid of your blackheads record fast is you're going to use this acid cream first to open up your pores and get rid of all the blackhead juices in there. Get them out of it." And I always talk about skin cream in these videos. I apologize. I just find it like the most obvious, pitchable, copyrightable market on planet Earth to explain. So, it says you're going to use this to get all the little pores clean, and then you're going to use our next supplement right here to close it all up. So, it's going to get rid of the blackheads and then shrink the pores. Do you see how easy that was to understand? Like, I didn't explain the science or anything behind it or anything complicated. Um, or assume the person had the problem or anything like that. I just basically laid out, hey, this is the process we're going to use here. And then it just showed endless endless endless endless results of that working. Okay? And so, that works really, really, really well. So, when people come to the page, like you have to understand, I see so many pages where it's describing the features, the the product itself, um the bottling, the brand, the company, all this stuff right here. You really need to go and show that it works. For example, I bought this very nice pair of pajamas recently. And the reason is because it cools my body down. At least that's what it says on the website. I just think I'm a rich guy buying stupid, expensive, overpriced But that's a whole other that's a whole other video. Anyways, the reason why I bought it, it showed people increasing their sleep times because the pajamas cooled them down and cooled down their body temperatures. Okay, you see how that worked right there? And then it showed a bunch of results and like studies about it. That's why I bought the product. And so, as I was skimming through Facebook, it convinced me first off that I had a problem because I was I was overheated when I was sleeping. Okay, it had like, you know, Brian Johnson talks about overheating when he's sleeping and you got to get your co your your body temperature this this amount right here. But did you know the sheets and what people wear the bed is overheating their body then stopping them from getting to the appropriate body temperature? Well, now we have these awesome expensive pajamas. You should come throw tons of Yeah. See, that's you can see how the process worked. And so, this is what you need to think about when you're running your ads. I know a lot of stuff in this video was kind of like had nothing to do with going inside the Facebook ad manager and optimizing your targeting and your ad copywriting or your ad headlines and UGC videos and your templates and scripts. That's because those things don't matter. What matters is that you go through the process that the customers think in your head and think about how you're going to market them and persuade them to go through that pathway that I just talked about right there. It doesn't matter what your funnel looks like. It doesn't matter what your ads look like. It matters that they go through this persuasion funnel process. What does their buying process look like? If you're running a B2B business ad, they're probably not going to buy from the first ad. So, it's going to look more like a retargeting combo. You have to think about how people are going to interact on the page of the site. When I mentioned like that hyperaric chamber, of course, people aren't going to buy from the damn ad. Okay? And they're going to have questions and they're so you might as well cut them off right there. You got to think about how people are going to behave on your website and like what's going on in their heads. Top of that, what is most important to them? What is the result that they're looking for? That's all they care about. That's all they care about. So focus on that in your ads. And then once they see the result, convince them of the problem they have that's stopping them from getting the result. That's what you have to identify. And then you show them massive benefits, massive gain, or massive loss to get them on to the next site. And then you back it up with results, testimonials, whatever. Once they get to the page, your main goal is convince them that it works. And if you are doing B2B, the thing you need to convince them as is that they will make more money by plugging this in without any risk whatsoever. That's the thing you need to do to get people to buy in B2B. When it comes to ecom and other stuff like that, what I talked about, remember the pajamas, remember the skin care. All right? You have to show those studies, those results, those re those testimonials, those things convince people that it works and then give them a very brief grasp of how it works so they grasp it, they can explain it to themselves, and then they're going to buy. This is going to turbocharge your ads no matter what you're doing. You you could literally just have a a butt puppet talking, and you're going to see better results in the ads you're running right now if you're breaking these rules right here. So, this has been the video for today, guys. If you want to see the actual scripts and ads for this, well, um, they're linked right here. So, I'm going to go make a potion in the Chamber of Secrets now, uh, which is my new office. So, uh, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

TITLE: I Explain A Facebook Ad Strategy That Made Me 100 Mil
VIDEO ID: FPSXDziI5C8
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPSXDziI5C8
================================================================================

No, you internet marketing sleeves bag. The title of this video is not clickbait. I'm going to show you how I make millions of dollars per month from a single Facebook ad campaign. It's the simplest thing you've ever seen. In fact, I'm going to show you the most profitable ad strategy and ad method by far. I literally mean this be the most profitable thing you ever do. This mindset shift, this thing you're going to see that I do with my ads that almost no one does with their ads. If you apply this to your YouTube ads, your Tik Tok ads, your Facebook ads, I don't care what the industry is, you are going to see a massive return. You're going to see your ads make two, three, five, 10 times more than they usually would. You are going to see ads in scale wildly open up like they never had before because suddenly your ads are going to make so much more money that you don't even have to spot check how much you're paying for the ads. They're just so damn profitable, it doesn't make any sense. The cap of your ads is how big your audience is. And if you're wondering what qualifies me to tell you this, I built multiple eight and nine figure businesses fueled by ads. I run one of the fastest growing ad tracking companies in the entire world right now, Hyros, which has billions and billions of dollars a month in ad spend going through it that we're tracking. And I can see exactly what is working in the industries that you work in. And the reason I am telling you all this is simply because I want you to make a lot more money with your ads. So much money that you think to yourself, hey, I' I'd probably like to make even more money. I should probably track my ads because if I track my ads, then I'll accurately see where all my sales are coming from and make better ad decisions that make my ads more profitable. Thus, use Hyros. So, my goal here is just to blatantly help you out so you make more money and to decide finally to increase your ad revenue by 10, 15, 20% just by plugging in Hyros. By the way, if it doesn't get that result for you, you don't pay for it. But enough about that right now. Let me just show you. So, look, first things first, if you want your ads to actually be profitable, actually track them. I promise I'm not going to talk about tracking your ads for the entire rest of the video. You will actually see what's going to make your ads insanely stupidly profitable. But if you want the number one tip, you can see right here, here's how many calls I was getting for my ads were actually tracked properly by Hyros. Here's what Facebook report. You can see in this example right now where we had 39 calls, Facebook caught 15. We had 166 calls here. Facebook caught 100. I don't see how you expect to run your ads and e-commerce calls, SAS demos. I don't care what you're doing if you're missing 30% of your tracking data. I don't see how you expect to be optimized cuz you're going to turn off ads that are making you money. And if you turn off ads that are making you money, you make less money. So please, when the video is done, if I help you out, come use Hyros. That's why every big name in the industry like Tony Robbins or Alexi uses it. That's why giant brands like bodybuilding.com and Playboy use it. That's why all the biggest names and influencers in the ad space like Ben Heath suggest it. It really works. It's really good. And if you don't see the results I'm talking about here in your ads on scale, you don't pay for it. So, now that we've talked about the actual metrics right here, I want to introduce to you a really bizarre crazy idea when it comes to advertising. So, I want you to do a little thought exercise with me. And this thought exercise is going to be more profitable for you. This this 10 minutes is going to be more profit than you 100 200 500 more hours spend in your ad account. So, whenever I see questions come in, I do webinars with all of our customers at Hyros and I'm not pitching Hyros anymore. I promise. I'm just saying I talk to a lot of media buyers and I get tons of questions and I can answer these questions because I see billions and billions of dollars of ad spend being spent in what's working and people got their Facebook ads, they got their Tik Tok ads, they got their YouTube ads, and they got their basic front-end funnels. Every single question ties into how much should I be paying per lead? How much should I be paying per call? What's the proper targeting I should be using right here? What ads are working right here? And let me give you the conclusion I've got from all of this. The big reason why people don't think their business is scaling and their ads are not scaling their business is because they think it's something they're not doing in the ad manager. They think it's something with their front-end funnel. This is despite them spending hundreds and hundreds of hours in their ad manager and spending tons infinite amounts of time on their front-end funnel. Now, look, if you're a person that has put in 30 minutes a day in into the ad manager once every two weeks and worked on your front-end funnel, has tried like one front-end funnel and not tested very many things, yes, you probably can go and make a lot of headway by going and optimizing your ads and your front-end funnel. But if you're a person that is watching YouTube videos like this and working on your advertising, this is the stupidest thought process you can ever have. Let me explain. If you look at the and again, you just do what I'm going to tell you next and you're going to make twice the amount of money right after this video. I'm not joking, but you have to understand this part. So, look, you are looking at these things right now, your Facebook, your Tik Tok, your YouTube ads. So, backing up to this right now in paid advertising, ad targeting has never been more simpler. The AI and ad platforms what mostly do it for you. You can literally not even set targeting once you've got enough conversions in there. So, step one of any Facebook, Tik Tok, YouTube ads, get conversions. Step two, let their targeting do it for you. That's going to work in a lot of instances. Now, on top of that, the advertising, the ads themselves, the creative, the copy, you know what the best ones are. If you spend any amount of time and effort, and a lot of it consistently in advertising, which I'm going to assume hard work is a default here. I'm going assume you do that. You know all the best ads that are converting right now. You know the UCD templates. You've seen all the best ads and what's working for other people. You have YouTube videos of YouTubers literally breaking out all the best ads that are working right now. And then you can see all the ads in the stream working. And if anybody does exceptionally well, you hear about it in your industry afterwards. You know all the ads they're working. You know how to make them. You've probably made them yourself. Then next, the front-end funnel. Now, there's only so many funnels you can make. If you've been in digital marketing for any amount of time, you know the basic funnels. You know the book funnels. You know the basic e-commerce funnels. You know the advanced ones, the crazy weird ones, too. And I'm sure you've seen um a lot of times that really you've seen a lot of basic funnels take off. For example, if you look at Alex Herozy's bookfunnel and his ads, it's something that's been around for the last decade. If you look at a lot of e-commerce stores that are doing very well or have grown in the last few years, it's not anything new. It's not anything different. So, I'm by default, we know that there's really not something if you're doing a lot of work and the ad manager that's going to be the secret to all this and it's not something in your front-end funnel. If you've been doing this for any amount of time, you are probably within what I like to call the good enough range. Which means no matter what you do in the ad manager, no matter what you do in your funnels, you're only going to get a 10% 15% increase. And that's not enough to fix the problems with most ad campaigns. It's only enough to scale you a little bit further because the core problem is not the ads or the funnels. Listen to me here. Yes, your ads and funnels and ads and and all that stuff is very, very important. But let's look at it this way. Let's let's break this down to a simple e-commerce product. Now, this applies to call funnels, demos, SAS products, doesn't matter. But e-commerce is a very simple business model. Person comes from the ad, they buy. That's that's the funnel. So, we're going to stick with that situation. All right. So, person comes through the funnel right here. After all said and done, you even at your your best scale, you're at 120% margins right here, meaning you make about 20%. Okay? You're breaking even almost. And the second you start to push it, you start to lose money. And no matter what you do right here, you just can't scale it any further. You You keep going up a little bit, 10%, 15%, then you go back down a little bit. So, how do we go and double this business? How can we make this business's ads double? It's this simple. We get every single person that bought right here, we get 50% of them to buy one more time. That That's it. This will literally double the ROI, double the profits of these ads overnight. It's that simple. Now, I know what you're thinking. Oh, well, I have some creative funnel or something like that. There's a million different ways you can attack this right here. We could go and offer a creative remarketing campaign or a follow-up funnel through it. We could offer a really crazy affiliate offer. We could offer something reoccurring. We could go and actually have someone call them on the phone and start selling them other things. There's infinite ways we can start thinking here as soon as we stop thinking over here and we start thinking over here. Now, getting people to buy more is one way we could go and make this business a lot more money. How can we also make the ads convert more? How can we make the business work better? Well, if we go and look at, for example, let's think about Alex or Mosy's ads. He has he has a bookfunnel, I think. I believe I actually don't know what ads Alex is running these days, but I imagine he has a bookunnel and I imagine you see some other famous marketers running bookunnels. Why do their ads convert better than everybody else's? Why are they making more money and able to scale further? Because they have a better brand. That's it. So, if we want these ads to convert higher, we want to make them 200% on the front end, 250% on the front end. Where should we be working on? Should we be working on these ads or should we be working on our brand? What is the reputation that we have online? So, for example, I see a lot of people their products don't work very well. I'll get into that here in a second. And so, they don't have good reviews online. I can't think of a better way to kill your ad uh conversions than bad reviews and lack of testimonials. You know what is a great way to improve your converter conversions? Do the opposite of that. Get tons of testimonials and have a great brand awareness all over the internet. Even better, make sure people know who the f you are before they see your ad. How do you do that? Well, where should you be putting in a 100 hours of work right here? If this stuff right here is only increasing you 10, 15%. You should be putting it in your social media content and brand. So, for example, if I'm running, let's let's look look at Brian Johnson, one of the most successful e-commerce examples right now on the entire internet. Why do you think his ads absolutely money, which I guarantee they do? It's because everybody knows who Brian Johnson is and they like him before they ever saw an ad from him. So, the secret to making your ads convert is not what's going on right here. I guarantee you that the remarketing that's going on with Brian Johnson's uh campaigns is people that watch his videos and people interested in health products uh and people that have been to their website. I guarantee you that's all their advertising is. And so, what's going on over here is they worked on their brand. Okay, that that's just being famous beforehand. Now, you're thinking, well, you know what? What if I what if I'm not famous or what if my brand isn't famous? Maybe you should stop working here and maybe you should start working over here then because this is not working. You're not scaling it. Going and trying to scale a product that does not have a good brand online, that does not have well thoughtout funnels. That's that's not going to work out for you long term. It's very verying hard. That's the entire point of this video. I see everybody on these calls, everybody in these webinars that comes in and talks to me, what what cost per call should I be getting? What cost per lead? What should I be saying in the ads when you've already written 500 different ads and you've you've gotten the cost per call as low as it's going to go for your business. The answer is as low as you can get it while it's profitable and as long as if you get it low enough then you work on everything else. Okay, let's talk about some other things. Maybe you get the people to buy your product more times. How do you do that? Make the product better. I don't care. Talk to your customer. Find out why they're not buying it twice. I guarantee that if if if you come in here and you're selling a product right here, you're selling a software, an info product or something like that, and then the people aren't buying tons more of it afterwards, go and ask them why they're not buying more afterwards, and then fix the product and improve it so they buy it two times. Suddenly, your ads are money. Or you can go ask them, "What else would they be interested in buying?" Or, "What else would they be interested in looking at?" Sell that to them. Suddenly, your ads are making tons more money. Ask them to leave testimonials and reviews and product reviews all over the internet. Suddenly your ads are making way more money. Get on interviews, get on podcast, get your product out there. Suddenly people have seen your product beforehand. And your ads start making you way more money. It's intangible, but go look at how your brand is online. Like do you have a professional brand that really tells people, hey, you can like trust this product? It's awesome. What is the overall radar of what people think about your brand online? If it's nothing, that's bad. If it's bad, that's bad. If it's just lukewarm reviews, that's bad. Like, you're not going to be able to scale a business like that. The end. Finally, let's look at one of the last angles you can go with right here. Do something new like this. This is this is going to blow your mind again because it's so obvious, but instead of trying to go out there and make everything work right here, do something unique. One of the reasons why Hyros worked so well with ads early on, we got such a foothold in the industry because no one was doing what we're doing because we solved a unique problem. Okay? If you look at, for example, HIMS, um, they were they're the people who go and sell like, uh, ED pills and stuff like that, the dudes on the internet. What they did, and the reason why their ads absolutely blew up money is because they went and created a unique product and they solved the problems with delivering these products to men um, without having to go see a doctor. They solved that and then their ads blew up. So, if you're looking at your products and everything like, why why the heck am I not able to scale my ads further? Do something unique. Solve a new problem. If your business is making money, do something unique that other people are not doing so you're not competing with 500 other people selling the same exact thing. Sell something that nobody else ising selling. This is how you go and stand out. Another example of this, let's look at info marketing. For example, when Alexi, I'm going to use Alex all the time because he's just a really good example. He's great entrepreneur. So, back in the day when everybody was doing their ClickFunnel stuff and everyone was selling consulting courses, uh, copying Sam Ovenans, uh, Alex went and made a gym course teaching gyms how to do businesses. No one in the gym business was doing this. He made tons of money doing it. Now, there's like 500 gym consulting companies out there like Gym Launch. What's the point? Like, you're you're competing with 500 other talking heads right there. So, do something unique. My big point right here is I see people stressing out over their business and their ads. And the truth is you cannot go out there and get your calls, your sales that much cheaper. Like at Hyru, I know that like there's nothing I can say in my ads. There is nothing I can do in the ad manager itself and with the landing pages to get it g to get it much cheaper than it is right now. I' I've tried for years. I've done it over and over again. The thing that gets it cheaper and the thing that blows up high-risisk's conversions is when there's tons of really good testimonials online when people are suggesting in their YouTube videos when I'm releasing tons of content like this and you're interacting when they get a positive brand interaction with me to the CEO. It's the reason why it starts to grow is when we have a unique angle in our ads or we have a unique product that we're actually selling. When we have an offer that is actually good and different than all the other tracking companies out there. When we add features or things that are creative and unique, that's what grows the company. When we work on the brand and the testimonials and results and we show those results constantly to people and remarket them over and over and over, that's when the ads convert. Yes, this stuff matters 100%. But what people think about your brand, what you're doing, what you're selling, and people buying more and more and more is what's important. to finally tack on that last part. At H High-Ris, one of the reasons why I can be so aggressive with our ads is because of one thing. People don't leave. But it doesn't this isn't a high-risisk pitch, okay? If you have an e-commerce product, you have an info product, you have whatever, if people just keep buying from you, you can throw endless amounts of money at ads, you can just be reckless and unoptimized as hell, and your business is going to absolutely money. So, what I wanted to leave you with today is just this kind of passionate speech about looking at everything else except the ads. You're you're trying to find you're trying to find a way to make your business grow via the advertising instead of actually building the business properly and thinking about what people think about the business and making them stay at the business. That's really the core. The ads are really important. Having good targeting, having good ads, that's great. But everybody knows how to do that. Everybody knows how to do If you've been doing it for years like I have, if you're watching this, you're probably media buyer. You know your ads. Like, it's good enough. There's nothing you're going to say in a UGC video or some magic uh interesting creative ad you're going to shoot that's going to double the business. The only thing that's going to double the business is the things I've talked about. And as soon as you do those things, your ads will open up and everything you've been doing in ads the past few years is going to blow up the business as well. So, do it, please. If you want actual tactics on how to do Facebook ad targeting, here you go. We'll tell you everything I'm doing. It breaks it all down, even how to make AI ads and all sorts of other cool stuff. There's so much other information on this channel about advertising, the actual nuts and bolts of ads. I just wanted to get this video out. Thanks,

================================================================================

so AI image generation has changed everything this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen and it's cut our cost to get calls and customers and sales down literally 50% at hyos and some of the other businesses I run it's insane and in this video I want to show you my image ad flow that I'm using to just just fart noises are the sounds of saving money by the way I don't know if you know that but this is what they are look this image flow that I have right here has allowed me to pump out so much really highlevel image ad creative you can see just the screen will get flooded with all of them right now this is what I just made like this morning in like 30 minutes it's insane and being able to replace creative this fast and Test new creative and make new creative this quickly has allowed me to just I can't make enough fart noises at you today the cost per sale is just plummeted and so what I want to show you today is my flow for creating these image ads so you can go do it yourself now if you don't know which you probably don't cuz I don't talk about my other companies other than High I have an image generation company and I've been on The Cutting Edge of this stuff for a while and you're probably thinking AI is a little bit scary not anymore the past week it's finally up to the point we're in the singularity point and anybody can come and apply this right now and start making just Oodles of improvements to their ads you like literally it's insane it's night and day what you can do with your advertising so I want to show you how I'm making these images now because in the past I've been making images with the AI and whatnot but you have to install stuff locally on your computer you have to generate models you have to train faces it doesn't always come out exactly right it's just not very effective for ads not anymore you can just L throw crap at the wall and it works amazingly well so I'm just going to teach you this 100% for free I don't have some Mastermind or anything to sell you all I want to do on this channel is teach you everything I know about advertising so that your ad sh money make you a lot more money and then when you're making a lot more money you're going to think to yourself I'd like to make more money and spend less money on ads to make more money and get more customer cheaper that's when you're probably going to use my tracking company hyros which pretty much everyone on planet Earth with a big name is using thousand and thousands of customers use it because if you plug this tracking into your ads you're going to get the accurate data see where all your sales are coming from to a te it tracks 340 50% more sales than Facebook ads Google ads whatever ad platform tracking you're using and that's going to make you at least 15% more on your ads or you literally don't pay for it I'm not joking come check out hus after this if your ads do not improve like all these freaking crazy amounts of people and people you know they're on the screen right now you don't pay for it so come check it out after it'll make your ad so much more money now let's talk about these image ads let's just with the absolute Basics here in chat gbt and I want to just show you flows now the cool thing about this is it's just it's made this so simple what I'm going to be showing you later on is how I actually use this uh locally in my own stable diffusion to create all sorts of cool images of myself and stuff like that I'm going to show you some advanced stuff but that's stuff that really isn't accessible to most people especially if you're new to AI image creation it's just not going to be um something you're going to be starting off with but now with chat GB BT it's so easy to do a lot of the basics here and this is going to get you 95% of the way there I'm going to show you the other stuff that's going to put you above everybody else at the end of this video though so let's just go over the basics right here if you haven't seen this using chat GPT to create images is crazy now we're going to be using a lot of my crypto content and if you ever been to my crypto side of my my content online it's it's just about the worst thing ever I apologize this is actually just a clone of me this is my evil stepbrother the person in those videos and and saying all those Terrible Things definitely not me so do not pay attention to that but you're going to see I'm using this a lot for my YouTube and creative and promotional side um of mar crypto related stuff too but I'm going to show you this primarily for use and ads that's the focus of this video so just to go over the basis right you can see I just threw a picture of myself in here please remake this image in studio gibly style okay so it just goes and makes a picture of myself right here now when you're using these commands you can see that you're going to need to a lot of times really keep chat gbt and guidelines you can see how it goes and made this iPhone size in said this size so what you need to do is be really taking in the mind um the specifics of what it's spitting out because it's going to try and go off the rails a little bit so telling it the dimensions and reemphasizing things is important which we'll get to here in a second um but you can see as I'm going through this right here I'm able to take this image and en use it to create several other images so you can tell it to okay put put this person in front of fire okay now put this in front of uh in a Solo leveling anime design right here so you can see we can just really tell it what we want and I'm sure as you play with this you're going to get better at talking to it you can see that the prompts I'm using right here making sure you can see these they're not exactly Advanced prompts we make this image in a solo level anime style holding a futuristic shotgun not too complicated right here but you can start to see the potential with this when it comes to ads because it allows you to create several different ads in different templates Styles colors everything very rapidly for example what I can do right here is I can take myself if we're just looking at like basic image type creation right here I can take a picture of myself and then make a picture of myself uh for promotions for example YouTube thumbnails or content for Twitter so you can just see how easy it is to move characters and images and kind of pass around your idea around a lot of things so I'm going to be getting into actually how to make faces and stuff look like you here in a second but let's just focus back on the the basics right here so the next thing I want to show you right here is you can see this this original image of myself I created here and I just want to show you how specific you can get right here so remake this image in the same style of Soul leveling but gave the character glowing blue eyes like Jin Wu and some scenes reference in the second photo they'll keep the same character design in the first footo but remove the sunglasses give the character the glowing eyes and have him looking down at the viewer but bam so this right here isn't too applicable to like ads or anything like that I just wanted to show you how specific it can get and I can't stress how crazy this is cuz um if if you look at stable diff Fusion the way you you generate ads is you have to go in and like type in I'm just showing you this this screen here to kind of show you how far it's come cuz it's mind-blowing but if we come right here the way we have to generate ads is by like putting in a prompt so if I'm like doing something like this I have to put in a photo of Becker cyberpunk background holding shotgun uh purple lighting okay and I can go right here and I can generate an image like this on my computer but this is how you have to you have to communicate with these things in the past and I'm just going to do an image to image generation right here and just generate a really quick one this is going to look terrible but you can see this this came out super bad right here cuz I haven't really set the settings but you can see how non-user friendly this is I would have to actually go and like adjust this right here generate it again and you can see we just we we really can't get down to the level of specifics that we can get in chat GPT with with ease so you can I really just want to stress to you just how good you have it at at this point in time with these images even if I'm just going over here to like text image I'm having to go and like communicate with it like this and you can see it really just you can see we got a pretty good image right here from it but you can see we really have to like communicate with differently and we can't get specific whereas I can just type in exactly what I want in chat gbt so this is like revolutionary crazy cool uh the fact that we can use this for ads day one is crazy so how we use this for actual ads let's actually get down to that start um or that type of process so of course really basic stuff we can do we can of course use it to create characters different images for ads and and whatnot but I want to kind of show you how I'm using it in particular so um let's go and look at this one right here so here's one where I went and I grabbed an image and you can see this image right here okay of course it's iock right here but the image we're ending up with is not the iock photo we're just using this as inspiration so what I want to show you right here first off is that you can go and create images simply by taking the photo and then drawing on it now I'm not actually using this image right here this is all just for Education what I just wanted to show how we can use this to instruct chat GPT so you can see I put like an image of a desk right here a guy walking in and so this is going to really kind of show the system how I want to make the ad so then I can go right here and put this right here okay so then what I can do is with this you want to see I want to I want to customize this image to maybe my Facebook ads so what I want to do is I wanted to convert this to a meme okay so you can see right here I have this and I'm slowly actually making this picture more relevant so you can see I told it to put like the Facebook ad ad manager and whatnot right here and kept evolving it now you can see I got really specific with this I was able to add lighting a person the ad manager crying or whatnot and then what I did is I just went and added some meme text on top of this to kind of complete this to create an image like this right here and so you can see I was able to very easily create a meme like image in seconds using chat gbt we can then upload to Facebook now if I want it I can go and actually just change everything about this to make this creative in multiple different ways so what I can do right here is I can come in I can say uh change the flames in this photo to green and keep everything else exactly the same so I can go get this photo put it in right here and in what chat gp2 will go and change the photo and the background everything to green and so you can see it's starting up now we'll check this result here in a few seconds so you can see the image has been created here and we can now use this to create endless amounts of variation of our creative for testing or just replace the the creative that is working with different colors and schemes every single day so we never have ad blindness that's pretty crazy now uh let me show you another example right here so I wanted to do one where I wanted to create this scene that we're looking at right here but in different styles so we can basically take the same exact ad and uh use it over and over again in different styles and themes so you can see this one right here I use it to create this image and so I just drew this out I decided to I said make a comic panel this is what's going on in the top panel I described a bunch of people engineer helmets and whatever and then I described these little bubbles right here and so you can see how well chat GPT can do text which is again incredible that's something you can't do in stable diffusion or anything on your computer so what I was thinking is like let's change this to different types of creative Styles so we can just pce this up and see what styles gting the most clicks so I said okay um shrink the image right here so it fits for Facebook ads but then change it to Studio gibl style okay and then I create different variations of this ad uh and minutes and so look I have like three different variations three different styles of these ads um all within about like 5 minutes of work so this is a way that you can easily use this to I think you can I think of all the possibilities here we can just create endless ads different styles different creatives different colors everything we want to do right here easily so I could come in here if I wanted to change this to like Pixar style I could say change this to Pixar style what you can see with this ad that I created right here look at look at all the variations of this ad I was able to create okay and so I just want to show you this one right here as the last example U make a three panel comic and Studio giblo style man is sitting in front of laptop panel two his wife is doing this this and you can even see how specific I can get so in this photo um and you can see just how specific we can get right here I can say all right I don't want this guy's face right here I want his wife's face right here and with a little bit of guidance for example I was able to draw a circle and say no replace this face right here don't add another face I was able to go and remove the face and put this right here so you can just see how specifically we can get with our flows and um creative we get with our ads you can see you can make anything so I want to talk a little bit about Ecom application right here what we're trying to do here with e-commerce ad say we want to make a really nice looking e-commerce ad or we want to make someone holding a bottle or arpr or anything we can just take a picture of something and throw it in here so if I wanted to I'm not making too many e-commerce ads right now but I think you probably get the gist of everything we want to do with this I can go and create my own bottle or design just by taking a picture of another ad and saying um create a beautiful wintry feeling ad with lotion in a Black Bottle similar to this image ad okay and then I could go right here and I could say put woman holding this bottle or I could literally just take a picture of some some product or my e-commerce product and then say make a picture of someone holding this product and displaying it for customers or something like that let's just literally do an example right here so we're going to go grab this image and I'm going to put say make a picture of a fat man in a gray shirt in front of a fire background holding this product clearly make the focus the product and put text at the top that says what a bad ad okay and so this just really to show you the potential of everything we can do as far as e-commerce goes and you can see just how specific we can get um with this now I'm going to make a slightly better looking ad right here since I was just showing you that but you can see in the original ad right here how nice we can make these ads look so this just gives you endless opportunities with uh e-commerce ads I can make this look really realistic and make it look like it's taken on an iPhone it it really doesn't matter and this right here like look at the detail of the text everything this is insane this is insane so obviously I think your your your juices should be buzzing if you run any type of e-commerce ads you see the massive amount of potential right here and I'm just going to go generate one more ad with this product right here so you can kind of see the potential I don't think I have to lay out to you what you can do with this going forward and it just if we want to make a better looking ad so make a very high quality ritzy elegant one to one dimension add displaying this product slightly burd and St I mean look at this this is this is incredible so the last thing I want to talk about before I get into any advanced tactics is I want to talk about ads particular if you're like an influencer or a personal brand because what chat GB fails at is this so for example if you come into this and I'm going to go let's go look at this monster hunter thumbnail I was making okay so look at these images right here I'm creating using the same exact flows that we've seen already so I said put myself in this image holding the sword in front of this monster right here so you can see chat gbt is actually really bad at faces this looks nothing like me so I want to show you a few Solutions I use to create these so if you're beginner one of the easiest ways to do this is you can just use a face swapping AI so if we come in here there's tons of AIS that you can use to just switch it out you can use face swap or AI whatever and these are just really super duper simple face swapping tools and all you do is you you put in a picture of your face and you can swap the faces over so this is where I would start if you're a beginner now these aren't particularly great for if you're making really serious influencer ads or whatever because the faces are just not going to match what you need they're not going to be the high quality you want um and so if we want to make really really good thumbnails I'm just going to give you a few little Advanced Techniques right here what you want to have is you want to use something like foul AI to go and train actually a picture of your yourself so what we can do is we can come in here come to this website and this is going to be more for advanced users you're just going to have to dig into this yourself I don't want to get into a whole entire lower training video or anything like that I just wanted to show you this so you can potentially just hire someone to do with this for you which is what I suggest and you just so you know this exist so you want to find someone to go to a site like fou AI or just train it locally on their computer and you can create what is called a Laura and so what luras are are basically files that allow you to save a character or design or style of image and so what I'm going to show you right here is how I created this image right here of myself and you can see that I'm able to generate pictures of myself not great what I want to do is come in and in paint these a little bit later on but what I do is I go and generate the picture originally inside of chat gbt so I generate the base images okay then I'm going to use either one of those face swapping tools I talked about just Google it experiment with different face swappers they're very cheap most of them are free or you want the hire our pace going to train you a model so I know all about training models and stuff like that so I just train my own model based on my face now you can see this is a really rough image because I drained the entire thing but what we're going to do is we're going to go and take this inside of stable diffusion AI on our computer and you can see then I can go and basically highlight over my face and you can see I'm accessing my model or my lore right here so I'm just going to inpaint my face right in here and then the result that is going to come out is I'm just going to show you this cuz it takes a few few minutes too long to generate while I'm filming on here but you can see the end result when we go and remove all the things right here is a face that looks a lot more like mine being generated inside the image and if I sat here and kind of like edited and and painted in I can get really really close to my face and this isn't even a specifically well-trained model so for if you're making ads for yourself your personal brand you're trying to put yourself in funny locations and stuff like that the flow you're going to use is generating the base image in chat GPT and then coming in and inating face using a fate swapping tool or just having a generation model made for you and so this what I showed you right here is not exactly a limited skill set not a lot of people know how to do this but it's not something you could pay someone 50 bucks to go put your face into it or hire someone to just quickly do this for you or generate a model you could also go and just look at how to use stable diffusion on your computer if you're not a technical person it's going to be a little bit challenging so I just wanted to show you that this exists so you know with the higher at least the faces and getting faces inside of images is the one thing chat gbt does very very poorly and every other image generation tool online does very very poorly so I think probably give it another couple months and that's going to be finished but that's how you handle that from now now the next thing I want to show you is how to use consistent characters for your ads so what we can do is for example I went and create this character for my ads all I did is I took a picture of Dwight from the office and then I used that I said create a character in a scene like this whose fat glasses up and I basically just made made a fat Dwight Okay so what you can also do is you can then go and give chat GPT a base image so I created this character and I said create a character sheet of this character right here okay so now I can do something like put this character sitting at a bar facing the camera using the same style drawing technique okay and so what I want to do is if I want to make ads and I have like a mascot or something like that I can quickly go and just create this character uh and place it quickly in ads over and over again so I can have like mascots or whatever so you can see like for example with hyros I wanted to create a a hyos character kind of similar to raster and Rivals and I'm not using this right here I'm not stealing raster okay love Rivals someone's going to watch it be like how dare you but you can see I can create like a gray version of them instantly or I can take images that artists create for me and use it to create tons of different images of that character okay so it can get very specific you can see how closely was able to replicate raster in different images and stuff like that so want to laid it out cuz creating consistent characters for your ads is something obviously people are going to want to do so let's see how this ad came out with him in a bar okay so you can see right here we have our consistent character now sitting at a bar and so what I can do is you can do all sorts of really neat stuff with this you could actually go and have chat GPT design the background and then say inject this character and you can create all sorts of angles and whatnot using this so I'm sure this probably gets your mind spinning right here the final little tip I'm going to give you is if you're not using drawn characters which that's where it starts to get really hairy because the specifics on a drawing character very small so cat GPT can get those right if we start making realistic images the body shape and everything starts kind of twisting so for example if you see with the monster hunter example I gave you you can see the body of the character keeps changing as I consistently start making the ads so every single time I say make a new ad it kind of like changes the character design just slightly every single time so this is kind of a pain in the butt especially when we get to like real faces where people notice the subtleties in faces so little I'm going to give you just for creation right here is if you're having trouble with this find a celebrity that has the same body type as yours if you don't want to go train models and whatnot find a celebrity has the same body type as yours consistently and so for example if you have a body similar like Robie D Jun chat GPD knows what he looks like then you generate images with him in the image and then you go change the face to yours or or whatever your your character is okay so outside of chat GPT using a face swapping tool or that stable diffusion technique I should you so that's just a little hack right there now the final thing I'm going to show you is just how we use this for Mass ad creation so obviously think of all the things we can do here we can obviously go and generate countless pictures of ourselves tons of different creative change the style change the colors change everything how do we test this with ads so in the next video I have coming up here I'm going to show you how we test all these ads all at once but just to kind of give you an idea of how to get started what I do is I just go and create an ad set for each batch of ads every single day if I'm doing this so for example like the the money burning ads you can see I just uploaded them all right here and then I can easily go in and I can see which ones are getting the most Impressions so this ad right here in this style gets the best Impressions I'm going to then graduate this to my major ad sets but as you can see I then also go and see which ones are getting the lowest cost per call so you can see like this one right here had a bunch of major winners in it and I'm getting $100 calls by the way just an FYI you should be using hyros to track these results because again Facebook is just missing so much of our tracking right here Google's going to miss so much of your tracking this is giving me the accurate data I need to see which ads are actually winners right here for these specific test so I can see this one's just a major winner and I wouldn't have been able to see that if I was using standard tracking so please after this video as well if you want to use this to its Max degree you should be tracking with hyros it's going to make you so much more money from your ads everybody uses it we guarantee you're going to see increase in your ad ey by 15% just by using this basic data right here don't even get into how we can actually train your AI to Target better on Facebook which you should do with hyros as well makes it even cheaper but you're just you're not going to be running your ads even near their maximum efficiency you're going to be paying more for a customer you're going to be turning off ads that are profitable um leaving on ads that are unprofitable just a whole mess with your ads if you're not using hyros tracking so come use hyros tracking we guarantee you'll see an increase in AD or you don't pay for it like actually literally and we have thousands and thousands and thousands of customers so that obviously works you can go look at our trust PL reviews and everything all the famous people that use it hos is absolutely awesome you should come check it out I'm very proud of it so that is a really basic tutorial on all the ways you can be using chat GPT for your advertising particularly with images now don't even get me started with what we can do with generating consistent characters backgrounds and in making animations and videos for our images it's a little bit more tedious than this but that's nothing that someone on your team if you train them to do it could not handle as their day-to-day job you could have three or four different animations going up every single day that look great which we're going to talk about in future videos next video we have coming up I'm actually going to break down how I'm testing and putting these all on Facebook and using this I'm sure if you're experienced ad run it's not going to be some crazy mystery but with this much creative being Unleashed we have to actually start running ads in a different way because before you'd have to submit to a cartoonist you get your ads back a week later and you maybe have four or five different ads a week now you can have 200 different creative ads every single week so how are we going to test this how are we going to grow this how are we going to use this to uh make a lot more sales for our business so that's the video for today this is crazy stuff hopefully it kind of engages your mind and gets you thinking about the ways you can use this because honestly there's an endless amount some creative ways to use this and those are some of the best tactics that I found to get what I want in a chat GP and then kind of push it around to alter the images how I want so I'll see you in the next video

================================================================================

if you want to scale and make more money from Facebook ads not having this makes you a clown so the title of this video unlike other videos is actually 100% accurate I've been making these AI ads that you're seeing right here on Facebook and they have been killing it this has cut our cost to get a call down nearly in half the cost to get a sail down nearly in half it is Shing money I'm very excited about it because what I'm going to show you in this video is my workflow to create these things and I if you do not know have a image generation company I was running I was a CEO of one and uh that's the side business I don't really talk about my other software companies here long story short I've been on The Cutting Edge of this for a while I've been using image generation on my computer training models and whatnot for a long time but it hasn't been good enough to use for ads consistently yet it hasn't been something that most people can put their hands on and get impact and change their entire ad Revenue business whatever with immediately and now it is I if you can't tell I'm a little bit excited here because what you're able to do with this stuff right here is shocking and it's shockingly easy for the first time to the point that anyone can do it I mean heck I've even successfully turned myself into a big boobed blonde I know some of you guys are into that it's really why you've been coming to this channel but I mean the the the possibilities here are endless and so what I'm going to show you right now is my exact flows for creating these types of video ads I'm going to make some image ad videos later on this week so you should subscribe to the channel and I'm going to show you my whole AI video training workflow here a little bit later on for ads but today I just want to show you a workflow for your ads that anybody can use and more so I want to show you how I'm using this with my ads to really drop the cost for everything and get calls and sales much cheaper by applying it to my existing ads you can just copy and paste this on what you're already doing and so what I'm going to do now is just show you my exact flow for that because on this channel I tell you everything I know for free because uh a I've already made a ton of money and two I don't have some Mastermind or or course that I want to sell you right now I simply just want you to maximize your ads make a sh ton of money and then when you make a of money you're probably going to want to track your ads accurately so you see your accurate data to scale with and so you don't burn and lose all your money which is when you're going to start using hyos my tracking company which literally everyone oning planet Earth uses that's a big name and you should too because if it doesn't grow your ad Roi on your ads you literally don't pay for it come check it out after this video it's wonderful but enough of that I'm not going to pitch you any more hyros at least for another 5 minutes we're going to get into this flow okay so I want to show you a super duper simple workflow um for this and it only takes a little bit of basic eding so if you have an editor um or you can I you could just literally train someone on your team to do this it isn't that hard if anyone on your team has ever worked with editing or you've ever worked with editing or you spend a whole fiveing minutes in 2025 to learn how to edit videos and dript or something like that it's not hard you can do this right here so let me walk you through how I made this video right here that's coming across the screen right now uh all the different angles all the the everything uh from start to finish all right so look we're in uh chat GPT right now maybe you've heard about it's a very small startup company uh I think I think they've they're making at least hundreds of dollars right now um I don't think they're going to be doing well in the future but who knows all right so what what we do here so first thing I did is I went and took a picture of myself you can see me here looking all old and flabby and uh don't tell anyone I'm aging but uh you just there you go take a picture of yourself I think you know to do that motherucker all right so then what I did it's very simple and I'm sure you've seen these Studio gibl things out of here and so I'm not here to teach you how to type in the uh chat GPT I'm here to teach you how to get the base for these videos because you can't just put this in here and it that makes a video so I'm going to walk you through this if you haven't seen the gibl stuff and you're living under a rock that's fine um but remake this image in studio gibl style and uh make in a hat and filming himself selfie style talking me so you see generates this picture right here okay um and so what I then did is I want to make a series of different videos from this so the first thing I did right here is I made this picture I made this picture and I converted myself into a girl right here because you know let's get freaky and weird with this I I if I don't have to hire actors for ads that's incredible I can just literally cosplay a hot blonde chick with big boobs and get people to buy my stuff from all over the Internet it's a dream come true that the singularity is awesome okay so the next thing we're going to do is we're going to come over to hedra okay so a lot of people are like oh look make Studio gibli things and when I saw I'm like okay screw making little memes for my family let's use this to just manipulate the people on the internet and get them to buy things so of course my mind just started turning majestically here so I immediately went and and started throwing this in here and now you have to understand AI editor I want to give you a lot of money image Generation stuff in the past but the whole thing that is unlocked here is the fact that chat GPD allows you to actually describe things and it accurately gets it right most of the time like if you're using stable diffusion on your computer or something like that which I use and we'll talk about that more when we get into the image ads um you're not really able to like say do this thing do this thing do this thing do this thing and like describe how the picture should look you have to use like lots of weird prompts and talk to it in like code and even then it's not going to come out correctly you can actually talk to it and make base images in chat gbt which is where this excels it's not really good at like doing face swaps or like specific things it's really good at giving you like your base image but that's about where it stops I don't think Sora is that good for making ad videos so that's where chat cppd kind of stops what is really good for making videos is head run I'm going to show you a few different layers here cuz the first thing you do is you just make a a image talk that's not where we're going to stop okay we're going to do a lot of more freaky stuff but you can do all sorts of stuff like for example in chat gbt convert yourself to a picture and then animated it's like so here's a picture of me in anime style um for my crypto stuff if you ever seen that it's terrible please don't ever watch it but you can do this you can go and anim animated photo but then what you can actually do is you can then upload a video of you speaking and you convert it to another Voice or just use your voice so for example um here's the initial video right here if you were on Facebook Google ads I applied this to 150 businesses Facebook so what I did is I just took one of my higher converting ads and I just I just took the audio from it and the video starts off with me talking into the video and I just took the audio and import it in here and so when we go down here we'll just go to uh create new video and then you'll add in the video you add in the let me make sure you can see this right here I'm just doing this all live because I'm lazy I'm not going to go and edit this after so you're just going to have to deal with that but you come right here and you're going to go and add a image and you're going to add a script and then you can go um upload the audio okay and I'm just going to go right here I'm just going to type in the script right here just whatever and you can choose a voice and make it play okay so just pick a person's voice press play and uh let's see what this actually says GFS so gibberish right there but anyways I'm going to show you the final result after we upload audio because I think this is all pretty self-explanatory once you see this I think you're going to get it so anyways the final thing is you can go and upload audio and it will be yourself talking it will make the image match your talking you can see right here I did it with another uh studio gibl if you want Facebook Google ads I applied this to 100 so that's pretty cool but that's everybody's going to be doing that you know you don't want to just stop there okay we can also convert ourself to a girl if you want Facebook Google ads I applied this to 150 businesses Facebook and Google ads that's great that one actually did the lowest conversions I was surprised by that is this anime one that did the best Okay so that's level one of course we can just go and take our ads or take little clips of these ads and do like maybe the first five second five 10 seconds like this that's what I was doing with my ads that worked really well I don't think that's going to work very well for a long period of time because everybody in their dog can do that we want to go to a level that other people cannot and so if you want to take this to the next level what you do is when you see which ad is converting or which character is converting the highest what you do is one I wanted to see if the the girl could do it so I made a bunch of different videos with the girl on here but the she didn't convert this highly as I thought I did so this guy right here he's the be's knees he just he just brings and apparently all the dudes that run ads they see that and they just get they just get their pants get tight all right and when I say Johnny goodlooking converts I mean we're here's some of the tests right here you can see in this one just from like the past day or so that we've been running these tests right here um we're getting sometimes on on normal hris ads we're getting 200 300 $400 price per call which is fine because of how our company Works we're getting $96 calls on this one and it's just crushing for us by the way you should be using hros tracking because I wouldn't be able to track literally any of this um Facebook ads caught four calls right here we had 13 calls just come in from this test so I mean I don't see how you're running your ads with half your data and not seeing where almost half your sales are coming from it's probably it's it's 100% losing you money you should come check out hyos after this and just plug it in because we guarantee you'll get better stats that you can then plug into your ad AI it will improve your targeting more and you get cheap clicks and make tons of money like we do but seriously though like we guarantee you'll get these results you should come and stop using this data because it's not accurate and run your ads with accurate data it tends to help the ads do better anyways back to the content so we're going to use Johnny goodls here which looks exactly like me we all know you don't have to tell me I know um so we're use Johnny goodls here AKA Alex Becker and what I then did is I took that original image and I said okay start generating pictures of him different angles so I'm thinking of all the different frames and stuff I want to use for videos now this is really quick and easy to do if I wanted to sit down for like a couple hours and do this I could make like a complex movie like video doing this this is to me just throwing sh at the wall uh I'm probably going to train someone on my team uh to build these type of videos and then they're going to spend all their time doing I don't have time to do this all day but if you're just getting started or whatever the potential is endless so I'm telling it to give multiple different pictures of me in different poses um can you create this character an image of this character but zoomed up and not close to his face in a way looking down at the view with big eyes keep uh the big color base everything format identical so it generates this picture right here and then I wanted to put in the clown face and I'm just telling it these prompts right here you can see like can you create an image of this character but zoomed up an noxiously close to his face uh put him in a clown makeup with the same expression please keep the color balance format the same voila you're going to you're going to prompting this isn't like prompting in stable diffusion or some other softwares it just translates to English you can just talk to it like it's a thing or a person person and they create these images so now what we're going to do my my friendly Pokémons is we're going to go and shoot new ads we're going to do little 5-second voice clips and so if we want to make an ad where it shifts between multiple different angles and faces here's what we're going to do so like the end result of this ad if you want to scale and make more money from Facebook ads not having this makes you a clown seriously we put this on 150 sites running Facebook 15 at least saw a 15% increase in ad wi let me repeat all 15 100% and all they had to do was paste this little line of code let me show you here's how this so you saw what I did right there and I'm going to break that down now okay I just wanted to show you kind of the end product so you understand what what we're we're trying to achieve here so obviously you see those multiple angles and everything going in you see the text and everything how do we do this so if you're smart you can probably already piece this together so what I do is I shoot 5-second audio clips and then what I do is I paste each one of these images in here so you see I start with the clown face and I put the audio in not tracking ads you are a clown okay so I did the one where I actually had my voice on it if you want to scale and make more money from Facebook okay and then what I do is I then I download that clip and I throw it into Camtasia and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to edit them together seriously we put this on 150 sites running face you see how that works pretty damn simple and all they had to do was paste this little line so you're going to make a new image and you want to keep the character consistent and you can make stuff so for like example I'm doing one with like this fat guy right now do you want your Facebook ads to make more money hi I'm Greg I buy media and I so that's s be like the beginning of the ad and you can just paste them all together now what I really suggest you doing I'm going to get into this more on my ad strategy is you don't want to make like entire ads about this you want to start the ads with like different characters see which one gets the best clicks and then what you want to do is maybe do like the first 15 20 seconds of your ad like that okay I'm going to get into the strategy a little bit in in the next videos here in a week or so so be sure to subscribe and so that's how you piece them all together and then with those the the the text and everything like that either send it to an Editor to do that for you are use one of the text generation AI apps that's on the internet been around forever and you can add the text and the overlays on top of it um with the effects and voila with that all being said we have these ads done ready for us and this took me about this is my first time doing this I have a bunch of other ones that are going up right now so they're even better than this one but this took me like 45 minutes and that's with trial and error I can get this process down to about 20 minutes and pump out one of these every single morning if I want uh don't even get me started on the image Generation stuff so this is the process and again the thing I would also suggest as well if you're going to do this you're going to see which ones are actually making you money when you're testing all these ads please I beg you track them with hyros you can see right here we are tracking literally seven times the calls as Facebook is catching right here I wouldn't be able to test these ads accurately if I was not using hyros tracking because we have all these funnels and stuff and sales that happen after that and I mean if you're just running your ads again without hyos you're Flying Blind and you're guessing what the your ads and I don't know why you're doing that cuz it's making you make so much more less money and you could just try hyros and we guarantee it will make you more money from your ads like you get an Roi we literally tracking double the calls because our tracking's improved so much over the years to like superb AI crazy level so you should use use hyros with this it'll make you a lot more money and I think that's what you're here for so what else do I want to yell at you right now as I bring this up so I have nothing else to yell at you about you should subscribe to this channel because I share lots of cool like I just did in this video and I'm G to be sharing even more AI ad stuff that you can use for your Facebook ads to um not pay artists and produce cheap crap that gets people to buy stuff from your internet so

TITLE: I Explain How Facebook "Story Ads" Net Me $24k A Day
VIDEO ID: 9mkDmdjMS9o
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mkDmdjMS9o
================================================================================

This manipulative process I'm going to show you right here gets people to view your ads and do what you want, which is really the goal of an ad. If you're running ads where you don't want people to view them, and you absolutely don't want them to do what you want, this is not the video for you. Just off. Go and watch some Tik Tok reaction video, I can't help you. But if that the the thing I mentioned previously, manipulating people on the internet very effectively to give you money is what you're seeking. Woo! this video. Woo! This is going to get you going because I'm going to give you a process for ads or really any content, but specifically for ads shrinking on this that gets people to not only watch your ad, but follow all the way through and then desperately need to click and then buy or do whatever the heck you want them to do on the opposite side of that ad. It's because the way that humans understand and want to do anything is through loops. And in this instance, story loops. They have to see the premise, the trailer for what they want in a very specific way that not only hooks them at the start, but then makes them say, "I want to see more at the end of it." And this is by using stories in our ads in a very specific templated way, which is great for you because this isn't going to require you to think. You could just copy what I'm doing right here. This for me has worked and built me multiple eight figureure businesses. It's built me a nine-figure business. And across billions of dollars worth of ad spend, which I see because I'm the CEO of Hyros, one of the largest tracking companies in the world, I consistently see story type ads, or at least ads that encompass this story-like mentality that I'm going to show you in this video, do exceptionally well. They have very high clicks. They have very high engagement. And a lot of times, if the offer on the other side of them doesn't suck ass, it sells a lot of that offer, too, because all the real work to selling that offer is done in the original ad. So, what I want to do in this video is I want to show you how this works without any course or mastermind to pitch you. It's all laid out here. There's no secret tip you have to pay me $59.99 for. And the reason for that is because I want you to go make so much more money with the content on this channel from your ads that you eventually think, "Wow, I'm making a lot of money. I'd like to make more money. Maybe I should track my ads and not run them like a drunken baboon and use Hyros," which literally everybody does. Maybe you already use it or you don't. And if you don't, well, everybody's using it. What are you doing, dork? You track your ads. It's important to see where your sales are coming from so you can get more of them and optimize your ads. I know it's a foreign thing, but please, once you make more money from this video, use it. So, that being said, let me show you what I like to call this storybook method to get people to not only watch your ads, but do what you want in your ads and then be hooked the entire way through. So, let's get into it. So, as always, the best way to explain this is with our very lowquality drawing board app presentation. I know you guys come here for the dog content. We're gonna keep it chef's kiss coming to you just the low quality content you've come to expect. So look, in order to get people to do stuff, you have to get their attention and you have to really you you have to make them want to complete an action. And the best way to make people to complete an action is to realize where you can remove holes in communication that pique their interest and make them want to keep the communication going. So the perfect way to really put this an example for you is when you watch a movie or a television show that's particularly gripping. The reason why you're watching it and the reason why you stop watching it when the show is complete or the story is complete is because the human brain has very specific needs to complete stories or complete loops. And what a story really is is a bloop that is done in such a way that you have to keep filling in the next blank, the next blank and the next blank. If you ever watch Harry Potter or any movie that you love, let's say Lord of the Rings, uh Frodo gets this ring and now it's going to cause all sorts of hell on earth if it's not thrown in Mount Mortar. What happens next? You can see there's a loop that has to be completed right there. And so the way people get moved through stories or movies or any good gripping content is there's this unfulfilled loop that they must always complete and the loop doesn't let them go until the end of it. It's not even really about the story. It's about the quality of the loop. On top of that, the most powerful human emotion there is is FOMO or fear of being left out or fear of not doing the most cutting edge thing or not knowing something that everybody else knows. If we can combine these two things together, we really can get people um interested in whatever the heck we're doing, even if it's not uh remotely unique or even one of their their interests. You can hook people that aren't even interested in like, I don't know, women's makeup into this process just by using this type of story loop right here. So, I'm going to walk you through this right here. Now, an example of these ads and me walking through scripts like this is linked below this video. And no, it's not a course or some mastermind. It's just another video on this YouTube channel. I just don't want this this video to be 30 minutes. So I'm going to explain the mythology and psychology and hysterology and things that end withology in this video and then you can go watch the script and everything broken down yourself after this video is done. So let's start from the very beginning right here and what's most important. So what we want to really focus on throughout this entire process I'm going to lay out to you is we want it to remain vague and complete and we never want to answer the story especially in the ad. What people do in ads, I'm just going to move up the video right here because we don't need to draw, is what people do in ads, it's a big mistake, is they try and explain everything they're doing and and get the whole entire story laid out there and make the person understand how it works. So, for example, at Hyros, we sell AI tracking and optimization that when you plug it in, it's going to make your ads much more profitable. I don't want I don't care if people understand how it work, particularly in the ad. I don't even care if they understand how we do it. If you look at a lot of our ads and hire us, which you can click at below this video, um there's all sorts of ads I've ran throughout my career when it comes to e-commerce or info marketing or whatever. I don't care if the person even understands how we're doing. I don't even care if the person understands that tracking. My goal with an ad is to get someone to click and want to learn more. I have to get them off of Facebook. I have to get them off of Instagram. I have to get them off of YouTube where there's Taylor Swift videos and cat videos and Only Fans girls shaking their ass every other scroll down. I have to get them away from that. They're not going to do anything I want when that type of is going on. I have to get them on my site and wanting to learn more. And then when they get to the the site, again, we don't want to complete the loop there either, but that's a whole other different game that is also explained below this video. It's what you should put on pages to get people to convert after. Everything's on this channel. You should never leave. But what I'm trying to do in an ad is we have to remember that we're trying to get the person to click and come for more information. We're not trying to explain to them anything. We don't want them to understand anything. So, you're like, "Hey, do you want to see uh Lord of the Rings? Here's every single thing that happens in the movie." No, we don't want to do that. We just want to show them the opening scene where like Froto puts the ring on and disappear. I don't I don't know. I'm not explaining. We want to show them the opening scene where Harry's getting a flood of letters from the wizardry school and you're like, "What the is going to happen next here? Why is there some fat giant man kicking down his door?" You want to see what's going on here. You don't want to be like, he gets invited to a wizardry store and then kills Voldemort. Spoiler alert, Harry Potter beats Voldemort in the first book if you didn't know. If you're under the age of 10 and you've never read that book, I'm I've just ruined it for you. But you don't want to tell them what happens. You want to get them to that point. So, how do we do that with our ads? So, the first thing we're going to do right here with our ads is we're going to start with a story slashbenefit. Now, what do I mean by that? There's two ways you can do this. You can tell the story of someone else getting a result or you can simply call out the person and talk about how you're getting a result using something they've never heard of before in both instances right here. So, if you go and look at the ads below, one of them you're going to see is where I'm selling people an infoarketing course. Um, and I talk about the results that person A got using this weird Walmart hacky method. Okay? And so, the reason why I say Walmart hacky method is because I don't want people to understand what I'm saying. I want them to think it you you want it to translate to how this person got this result doing something you've never heard of before but should know about. So what I like to use is I like to use similar type of wording like Walmart which is very real which people relate to but then also make it seem like something they don't understand or they never heard about before. So using this Walmart espionage method or something like that. So, it's something they understand and something they don't understand to relate to something that they feel they could grasp, but they don't actually understand what it is, which makes them want to hear how they got the result. Two, you can just literally call it out. Are you a person that runs ads and wants to see 15% more? Okay. Um, from this, I'm going to show you how we did this with this thing that you've never heard of and are not doing because you're kind of stupid. That's that's not what we're I'm trying to convey in ads. But what I'm trying to make the person do is feel a little bit insecure. Because if you ever look at like media buyers for example, if you're a media buyer watching this, which is the audience for this channel, I'm going to tell you something about yourself, you get a little bit insecure constantly because there's always people that are upping the ante when it comes to running ads. And so you're constantly thinking, oh, what's this this thing I'm missing out on? What's this ads I'm missing out on? What's this one thing I'm not doing in the ad platform manager that I'm missing out on? If you look at all the best media ad buying content internet, it's always like this one thing you're not doing that everybody else is. That's what we want to get going. And so we we do this by entering the story like this. So if you see the ads for hires, it's going to be you know this one thing um is increasing ads by 15%. It's AI print tracking. Now what we want to do is again connect it to something that they believe that they don't already know. So if you look at the ads for Hyros for example, I I connect it to AI print tracking. Now what is AI print tracking optimization? I don't actually know. I made up the word like four years ago. It's just a fancy word for um I don't I don't actually even know what it means. At Tyrros, we do a lot of top tier tracking and a lot of things that other people don't do that allow us to track ads and optimize them with AI. But to sum up all the cool fancy stuff we do, I just made up a big broad term that nobody understands. Why? Because when we start the story of how this person got a result or how you can get results, we want to connect it to something that they don't understand. Why? Because when they don't understand it, then they think that they're missing out on something. And so this whole entire story loop just opened up that leaves them feeling insecure or missing out and that there's this piece of information that they don't understand that they need to complete. So we connect it to this vague slightly relatable thing AI print tracking. Now what's what's how does the AI work? All right. What is print tracking? How does isn't tracking connecting an attribute? How does how does how is this different than other tracking? All these questions pop up. And that's really what we want to do. We want to connect the result to a bunch of terms or terminology or story that creates tons of questions. It doesn't answer anything and we just want to keep building on these questions. Now, what people really care about this is this result and then figuring out the mystery of the result. So, the number one thing we don't want to give them when we're running ads is this because this is what's going to hook them around. We don't want to we don't want them to understand how the result is and we don't even want them to understand what we're doing. We want them to feel almost more confused and needing to click at the end of the ad. So, what we're then going to do is we're going to follow this exact pattern right here. All right. So, we already have them hooked with the storybook opener right here. What we then want to do in this instance is connect it to a big bet that works or a big bet slash sign of strength. So, when I was doing infoarketing ads, for example, um it was like the story of how this person made this much money doing the weird Amazon espionage thing. And to prove how consistently it works, we're going to do this live in front of you uh during a full call and get to $200 a day with this store. So, what is this? This is like a feat of strength. This is if I'm saying like, look, I have this this creatine powder that increases strength 150%. And what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to give it to a ton of people live in this video right here on the other side of this ad. And we're going to track their before and after results within one day of each other. And you're going to see the huge gains across 20 different people. This is some big giant feet of strength bet. This creates like this, hey, this result right here that you don't understand is incredible. And we're going to do something crazy to prove that it works. Okay. What I do at Hyros right here is I make the big AI tracking, the big announcement or whatever of how it improves people's ads, which it does across 4,000 plus businesses, pretty much every big name on the internet. When people sign up for Hyros and use it, they see 15 to 20% increases in their ads. Because if you don't track your ads and you don't use that data to optimize your ads, you're going to get worse results. I don't see how people expect to run their ad accounts accurately when you're only seeing 60% of your sales and none of your long-term revenue coming in. I mean, look at my ads just right here for Hyros. Facebook is tracking like 60% of the calls that we're doing. If I was running my ads off Facebook data, I would not have a business. I would not be able to run my ads because I don't know which ads are profitable and which ones are killing it. And the way you grow ads and the way you make more money is you find the ads that are killing it and you scale them and you can't see what ads are killing it if you don't track it. I'm not going to get into that anymore. I think you guys all know what it does. That's my slight hybrid show for the video. Let's get back to the actual content. But what I'm going to do in those ads is I'm going to say, "Look, if you or the way you know that this works is that if this does not deliver the result that it's looking for, aka you don't see this result right here, you don't pay for it." And this has worked across 4,000 plus businesses. So, you know that if this didn't work, we wouldn't have a business model right here. What I'm doing right here is I'm making a big bet or a fit of a feat of strength. Okay. So, the final way to really explain this is like there's this really famous golf ad where this guy says, "I'm going to hit this ball 400 yards, and I'll I'll prove it to you right now." And then he hits it 400 yards. You want to set up some type of story where if people click, the worst thing about that ad I just brought up is that he solves the whole entire story in the ad itself. You want to say, "Hey, if you come click this video right here, you come click this, I'm going to hit this ball 400 yards 10 times in a row right in front of you." because we want to get them isolated before we actually start hitting them hard. That's just one thing that's throwing in right there. But we want to make some big bet of strength or feet of strength or some big bet to lure them in because they want to see if this bet actually pays off. All right, so that's the next thing we want to do in our ads. Then what the person is looking for in this ad right now is for you to explain how it works. We're not going to do that at all. What we're going to do is we're actually going to qualify it. So, what I'll do at info businesses is I'll collect all of our results and testimonials and say, "Look, you're going to have to click this ad to see what I just talked about on the other side, but here's the endless amount of testimonials and results of people that have gotten results." And then you show tons and tons of results. What I'm going to do at Hyros is I'm going to show all the famous customers that we have and all the big brands and all large businesses that we have. than than all the thousands and thousands of other testimonials that we have to say, "Look, I don't have time to explain this in this video, but here's absolute undeniable proof that this works." And then what we're going to do in the ad is we're going to tell them what to do next and a reason to do it now. So, when we're doing this, we want to tell the person what to do next. Obviously, a lot of people just don't tell people to click the ad or don't tell people to move forward and don't tell them what to do on the next page. What we want to do is we want to tell them that they need to move now and set this up. So, there's m multiple different ways we can do this. If you're using an info business or an ecom business, using specials, discounts, some type of lower to get people to click the ad is absolute bangers. And I think you should use that especially when you're retargeting because then you can really if they sell the first offer and you offer them a special offer, they're much more likely to jump into that special offer. If you show people the special discounted offer right away, it's not special. So, you can use all sorts of things like that. At our info business, we use like, for example, this presentation is limited or, you know, we're only doing a few of these a week kind of thing. Now, of course, with infoarketing, that's a little bit tongue-in-cheek where you're always doing some special discount or some special weekly thing, but it just gives people a reason to click. Now, okay, at Hyros, what I like to do is I like to just basically point out every single day you're not doing this, you're losing money and not able to move forward with this. This is not as strong as a discount or a scarcity based reason or some time or or something exclusively they're going to get or miss out on. However, having some reason for them to click now is just what you want to finish up the ad with. And what we want to focus on right here is we created this story at the very start of the ad. We we started Lord of the Rings and then we literally didn't tell them anything about what happens next. And they still want to know the answer to this damn story. But now what they also know throughout this is that the story is very good. I introduced that I the idea of AI print tracking to them and they want to know what it is and all I've done is just verified that it absolutely rocks with the info marketing or e-commerce story that I talked about before how this person right here went and was able to get a house with how much money they made from this certain thing. All I did after that is I didn't ever tell them how the story ends. I just simply verified that the story is 100% real and delivers the result and all that stuff they're looking for. So, aka this movie is really good. And so, that's what we want to be doing in our ads. You never want to just answer the loop or or even halfway complete the loop when you're creating an ad. What you want to do is you want to get them hooked and very interested in the story and then verify that the story delivers the juice that they're looking for. Then once you get them to the page itself, there's a whole other game to be played when it comes to bombing them with results and making the story work with this ad and completing it. Which is why as soon as you finish this video, you should watch one of the videos below that breaks down the scripts for these ad. You It's literally word for word what you should be writing into it. On top of that, I break down the pages, how I sell from the pages, everything that works. This stuff absolutely drives massive amounts of clicks from Facebook, YouTube ads. And as the years have progressed, I have not been able to find a format that ad or a format of ad that works better than this. So go watch those videos. That's the video for today. You have more content to watch, so I'm just going to let you click below and see those. I'll see you in the next video this

================================================================================

All right, you are here because you want to put a$150 cents into Facebook and make a $100 back. That's totally reasonable. Don't let me stop you from dreaming right here. Look, this channel is dedicated to internet sleeves balls like you. So, what I'm going to do in this video is I'm going to show you a bunch of simple tactics I've used on Facebook ads that allow me to put in very low amounts of money and make huge returns. In fact, I built a business past over $10 million per year investing relatively small amounts in Facebook ads. In fact, what I'm going to show you right here allowed me to go from businesses that spent $10 to $20 million a year in ads, literally, and only made like a 2x ROI to businesses that spent, I don't know, a couple hundred,000 a year in ads and made 15, 20x just just crazy ROIs from it. In fact, it was just shocking how much money we made from our ads just by making these simple changes in our businesses and how we look at them. And you should listen to me on this because a I don't have any course or any product to sell you right here. I'm just going to tell you everything I know about ads. And what I know about ads is the fact that I built multiple eight figureure businesses purely fueled by ads and actually built a nine figure business. Again, kickstarted and grown via ads. On top of that, I'm also the CEO of one of the largest tracking companies in the world right now, Hyros, which allows me to see what's working across billions of dollars of ad spend. So, what I'm going to tell you right here, this is the source of the stream knowledge. This is coming straight from the source, straight from the cow. That's the type of cheese that you're getting here. So, without further ado, let me show you these tacticum changes that we use to uh get these results. All right, so let's begin. These five tips right here. You just apply these, you're going to see so much more money from ads from such low spends. In fact, you can build entire businesses around them if you want. Seven figure businesses. I've done this before with these tiny little tactics. So, just just use them. So, I'm going to give you the pinnacle of cheap bozo make tons of money from your ads with no investment upfront tactic ever. This is the most important thing. And in fact, I'm doing this to you right now. I used this originally to start hiring and grow it to very high levels and businesses I've shown this to that do this and apply this fully. A lot of them don't even run large scale ads. They just do this and some of them make up to eight figures a year just doing this simple little tactic. So look, number one priority if you don't want to spend money on ads or you're just starting up your business and want to go in kind of low is you need to go and simply make content on the internet and then remarket people that come from that content. This sounds super duper simple. No one does this. It's insane. Let me just show you an example of what we're doing right here. So, for example, you're watching this channel right now. I obviously want you to buy Hyros. And the way I'm doing that is by helping you with tons of content. We'll make more revenue from your ads so that you eventually decide to track them. Okay? There's no secret to that. But let me kind of show you how this channel with not many views. For example, if you go look at like my crypto channel for example, we get tons of views right there. I slayed. I'm the number one crypto advice guy on the internet. But we're not here to really talk about making a channel like that. When a lot of people talk about YouTube, they're thinking, "Oh, I got to go get millions of subscribers and stuff like that." No, not at all. Okay, so for example, like my channel right here, I was talking to an ad run the other day. Um, Sam Polo, he uses this channel right here. You can see he only has 12K subscribers. And I know that they do very, very well from their channel. And there's a ton of other channels that I'm referencing that are a lot like channels like this where they're only 10, 12, 30k, 50K subscribers. Uh, I was looking at some content from Hormosi the other day and he was talking about a very very small Instagram that was making tons like millions and millions of dollars off of like 12,000 followers or something like that. This is what we're trying to focus on right here and this is probably one of the best ways to run a type of business period because it's just so damn profitable, especially if you're a beginner and don't want to go on high investment. Now, how is this working? There's a few simple things we're doing right here. Okay. So, if we go look at this video, not that video, you see my video right here that we're able to view. Obviously, voila. You you you're looking at a video right now. I'm sure you know how YouTube works. But what is going to happen after this video is a few things. So, let's imagine this is the the content right here. First off, you're going to get added to a Google remarketing list. So, this is why I love making YouTube videos because you're automatically added to a remarketing list. And if you're watching this video, you're already interested in running ads. It is going to be so damn profitable for me to run any type of product selling ad content training optimization to you after this. It's building the best remarketing list on planet earth. Okay, so we can do that. On top of that, from your videos, you can always link to other websites. Now, I don't really do that in these videos, but you can always talk about your website or your product website uh and send people to that at the end of the video or for the capture leads or whatever. People that come from your videos or your content to these pages again make an insanely good remarketing list. So remarket people that watch those videos. This also applies then to content from everywhere. So let's imagine we're making content on YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram. Okay. Not only is all this content of course allow you to be remarketed, you could remarket the people that follow you on Twitter. You can remarket the people that follow you on Instagram, on YouTube, but you can also remarket the people that watch your videos on these platforms, even if they follow you or not. You can also remarket to people that come to your website from these platforms. And what I suggest you do with these when you're linking from them, don't just link people directly to your website. Link people directly to your pages for for example, I can make like hyros.com/youtube and you go there to get a special deal. So that gets you your most engaged people. Now, what do you do with these audiences from this? Very simple. You put them on remarketing lists on Facebook, YouTube or whatever and then you sell them. That's it. You can run and build a seven or eight figure business just with this tactic alone. For example, on some of my videos right here, let's say we get like 20,000 views. Okay? If I get a 100 people to buy Pyros, I have these 20,000 people right here with our average value per subscriber on there being $500 per month. I made about $600,000 from just the people watching this video right here. Now, that video is a little bit bumped up there. Again, this would be again factoring all the reoccurring per year and everything that comes in it, but you can see how simple it would be for me to get a nice retargeting list of 20,000 people. And if I do a really good job on this video right here, just getting a 100 people of that 20,000 to buy or become customers over the span of a year. Really isn't that damn challenging. And that's all just from this. And I can literally spend, I don't know, 50 bucks a day remarketing this entire list right here. This is how damn profitable that method is. Everyone should be using this as their base method for running advertising online. On top of all these little bonus tip, track your ads. Look, you guys know I own high-risisk. You think, "Oh, he's just trying to get us to buy his product." Yes, I am. Because it will make you a lot more money or you don't pay for it. There's literally a guarantee at highrisis if you don't see an increase in your ad ROI. You don't pay for it because of this. Look, you need to track your ads because if you look at some campaigns I have right here, for example, I caught 61 calls right here. Facebook told me I got 31, 19, 12. A lot of these campaigns I'm looking at right here are tracking half the amount of calls coming in. If you look right here that Harris is catching, I don't see how you expect to run ads profitably or maximize it if you can't see where your sales are coming from. Because if you can't see where all your sales are coming from and which ads are the most profitable, you can't optimize and scale the ads that are most profitable, thus making you the most profit off the littlest amount of ad spend. So, if you want to really maximize your ads on top of all these tactics I'm saying right here, track your ads so you can actually see where all the revenue is coming in from all the calls and not just the upfront revenues coming in, but the long-term revenue that's coming in as well so you can attribute back to your ads and maximize the amount of profit they make. It's not that crazy. You should use it. So, just a very basic tip, actually track your business like a a smart person and don't run it like a drunken baboon. It's kind of a broad swipe with a brush statement, but you should do that. Now, let me give you the next best method right here. And this is in fact how I grew Hyru very successfully when a lot of other SAS companies similar to our our company didn't do so well because they didn't understand this. So, when you're running ads anywhere online, what you want to try and do is get people to buy as much upfront as possible using calls if you can. Now, it doesn't always have to be calls. It can be a webinar if you're doing like an e-commerce product or something like that or it can be a long form sales video. I think calls are the best. Webinars are second and then long form sales videos. I I don't know. I think it's kind of difficult to get people to buy expensive things without really um completely sexually harassing them with a sales pitch, which can be done in calls or a webinar. So, why does this work so damn well? I'm going to give you a simple situation right here. I'm going to bump up the screen so you know that I'm super duper serious. So, one of the reasons why Hyros was really successful early on that you should apply to your business, whether you're selling e-commerce products, software, B2B, infoarketing, I don't know, some get-richqu online, all you all you scuzzbags out there, I know you're watching this, too. Is the reason why that hyros did well originally is because a lot of other SAS companies were selling stuff for like $99 a month and you'd sign up for a free trial or something like that. That's so damn hard to make a profitable business off of because you're not making I'm not making maximum amount of money from each customer that you get. Let me explain. So, let's imagine I'm running an ad where I'm going to spend $1,000, okay? And then my my product is $100 per month and I have a 3% conversion rate. All right? And if I'm spending, let's say $5 per click, I'm going to get 200 clicks. So, off of this, what I'm going to get is about uh six conversions at $100. Now, these are really like rough numbers. I'm going make $600 back per month. And if this is recurring, this is actually awesome. These are actually inflated numbers. If you're running SAS or something like this, but if we go right here, okay, for example, and then we cut this conversion rate down to 1.5%. We cut it in half. Okay, so imagine that. But instead of selling that $100 upfront for the product, we get people on a phone call and we sell them it a year up front. And so this is what we did with Hyru that made it really successful in the beginning. So if we do this right here and we have half that conversion rate right there and we have 200 clicks, we're going to get three sales at $1,200. Okay? So that's going to put us at $3,600 back immediately on that $1,000 in ad spend. This is night and day difference than what we were doing before. And what a lot of people do is they try to sell their lower-end products or their reoccurring products or products at not high enough price point. The thing is, when you run ads, the same people that buy at $100 will often buy at a year upfront or a much larger package of some sort, if you get them on a phone call or you get them on a long enough webinar pitch. And so really, the key to running super profitable ads is you try and collect as much money up front, even if it kills the conversion rate a little bit, because when you're just starting your business, you need that cash flow in. The reason why Hires was very successful up front when a lot of other businesses failed is we collected massive amounts of profit on our ads that allowed us to keep investing in our development and the product itself. A lot of other companies were trying to do that $100 method and then because of that they had to take massive losses in order to grow their company from ads. This is a much better way to do it if you want to make more money from your ads, especially on a low budget. Next, while we're on the topic of reoccurring, the easiest thing you can do with your ads to make more money from them is you need to add some type of reoccurring to your offer. period. Okay. So, for example, I I think we all understand this. If you have a $40 product and you manage to put in a $10 supplement subscription or anything like that, you just increase the value of this $40 sale and people are very e it's very easy to get them on like $10, $20 subscriptions to $120 a year. Okay? And what this allows you to do is build a business where you have income coming in no matter what. You need to have money coming in from sales once you get them. Period. I I can't give you any better tip for your business than find some way to make your offer reoccurring. If you're selling an e-commerce product, find some type of reoccurring subscription you can add into there. Heck, make the main product a reoccurring subscription on its own at a discount. This is so damn important because when you get people buying two, three, four times, it's more than that they buy one time. It's such a common sense statement, but very few people do this. Every single business you run should have some type of reoccurring offer, whether it's in the front end or the back end, to get people on this. And this is how you're going to maximize your business from low ad spends because every single month, if let's say you add $3,000 in subscribers or reoccurring income, that's not that much. But if you do that every single month for an entire year with like, I don't know, a 5% churn, imagine if your product doesn't suck or something like that, you're making 20 30,000 a month reoccurring from the same lower budget ad spend. That's why reoccurring is so important because if we're not doing reoccurring, we're basically have to remake that again every single month. If we are doing reoccurring, that $1,000 in ad spend that generated this doesn't have to go up and we can keep spending that low amount of ad spend until we have enough reoccurring income coming in that allows us to then kind of up this a little bit more or more comfortably. This is so incredibly important to running businesses from ads. Businesses that don't have reoccurring income coming in. It becomes extremely hard to grow the business off of just upfront sales from ads. Finally, if you want to maximize your ads as much as possible, find a way to work scarcity in immediately. Now, you don't always want to do this at scale, okay? But if you can work scarcity in realistically from your ads or in the remarketing of those ads. So, for example, if a person comes to my page selling socks, what I'm immediately going to do with the remarketing ads is offer them a 5% discount or coupon if they come back and buy in the next couple hours. We actually have AI at Hyris now that does this for Hyris, but other companies as well. It's built into the proc that comes through and passively does this. So, a person comes to a page, the AI automatically starts messaging them custom emails, offering them scarcity right away. If you can use it in the original ad, great. But it's kind of hard to sometimes do this. One thing you can actually do is say, "Hey, you came to the website. I want you to come back and get this immediately and offer them some type of discount, some reason to act now." The reason why a lot of people don't buy from ads simply comes down to there's no reason to act now. It can be the smallest reason on planet Earth. look at your ads and say, "Is there some scarcity, particularly in your remarketing ads?" It's the easiest way to take your dollar in ad spend that gives you $2 back and make it $3 back. But make sure it's realistic scarcity. If you're doing just a general like, "Hey, you better act now or this offer will be gone forever." That doesn't work and it just it doesn't build trust with your customers. Using these tiny little effective marketing scarcity tactics, whatever it is, so damn important to increasing the value of your ads. And then last things last, it ties into this. When a person comes to your website, don't just remarket them. Remarket exactly what they viewed. So when a person comes to any of our e-commerce websites or Hyros in particular, we don't just remarket them based on them coming to the website. We market them based on what they looked at in particular. So, for example, if you come to Hyros and you land on an ecom page and then you go from the ecom page to our call page, what we're going to do is we're going to say or send you an email if we have your contact information and text message and also run ads to you focused around e-commerce and the fact that you didn't book a call. Okay, this is super minute retargeting. And this is exactly what you want to do if you want to make maximum return on your ads while spending as little as possible. It takes like 50 cents to remarket this person right here. But if we go right here and we have the person come to the site and then we just remarket them like, "Hey, you came to Hyru. Come back and check it out." Not going to work. If we remarket them saying, "Hey, we noticed you checked out an e-commerce page and didn't book a call, but we're on the fence. Why don't you come back and book a call right now? And if you do so in the next hour, next two hours, we'll give you a 5% discount if you choose to buy." This gets people to take action right there. This is the front-loaded specific information, specific remarketing that is going to get people to take action and give you maximum profit for the tiniest amount of ad spend that you spend. And while this isn't important, if you're spending $100,000 a day in ad spend and you're kind of broad and shotgunning and building some big business, if you're a business that needs to make money cash upfront, these are the things you need to be doing immediately now, not optional, to make the most return on your ads to put you in as much profit as possible. These methods right here are the best things you can possibly do. That's all I got. If you want to see the actual ads, the scripts, the targeting, it's all on this channel as well. There is nothing held back. Browse around. There'll be some videos at the end of this video that show you how it's done. And for the love of gravy, once you get some level of competence on the things I teach on this channel, track your ads with Hyros because you can see where your actual sales are coming from and optimize for it. I can't stress how blind you are if you're not running ads with proper tracking, which you should use with Hyros. And you can also use all those AI tactics that I talked about as well. So, I'll see you in the next video. Goodbye.

TITLE: I'm Using This "Dead" Ad Source To Make Millions
VIDEO ID: mOA3UiVQL30
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOA3UiVQL30
================================================================================

internet marketing skis bag in this video I'm going to show you an ad source that essentially no one is using right now and the few people that are using it are using it wrong now as you know I'm the best ADR runner in the history of the entire internet so of course I know about this ad source and I am also using it right Jokes Aside though that's exactly what you're going to see in this video and I have to Hype it up with that goofy intro that fry fruy way of introduce things because this is the most gray generic boring ad Source there is it is Google search it is the oldest form of ads in our generation and nobody's really using this everybody always writes us out especially in internet marketing but I'm going to show you today how we're using it to generate millions and millions of dollars at our business crazy phenomenal return it's like 10 to one on some of these ads and the thing is that most people and most businesses most internet marketing businesses just don't use it because they think it's too expensive or they don't know how so what I'm going to do in this video is point blank let you look at our ads and I'm going to show you how I write our ads for this so you can then just go and this because I thought search ads were stupid for the longest time I just like the keywords don't convert it's it sucks whatever but I've been using them a lot recently at hyos and I've been advising and looking at other few businesses and it's just been shaking money which is kind of surprising to me because I spent tens and tens of millions of dollars in ads over the years generated and built two eight figure businesses one nine figureure business and this is really the first time I've been getting around to this and what I'm also seeing in hyos as you know I'm the CEO of one of the largest ad tracking companies in the world right now what I'm seeing is a again a lot of people in hyros are not using search ads but the few that are it is absolutely printing money for them when they're doing it right so this is something you really want to look at right now and understand I think it and a gdm display network are the two most underrated ad sources right now that nobody's using and you should figure them out so without further Ado let me take you behind some of our ads and kind of show you my theory and strategy behind this and this works for all types of businesses more so what I'm going to focus on here is internet marketing and digital businesses not so much local businesses that people mostly use it for so let's hop into it we're inside the Google campaign manager and I just want to break down how we're doing this how we're making money now we're looking at two types of campaigns right here we're looking at our gdn campaigns we're also looking at our search campaigns I'm using keyword targeting for both of these which is why I'm going to talk about both so Nuts and Bolts real quick the value per call if we get it from Facebook or Instagram or anything like that is going to be about $11,000 at hyos give or take now I'm not trying to make apples apples to your business I'm just showing you our kind of margins with this now also the way we're getting those margins the way we're tracking that return is by tracking the lead for years when it comes in so for example if we get a call we're tracking all the rebuilding that's likely to happen all the sales that are likely to come in all the extra purchases all the things in total and we average that all together they get their LTV or their value per lead over about a year and a half that's how we do business at hos and that's how you really should be running ads because that allows us to buy ads super duper aggressively because we can see everything the lead is going going to buy over years by the way if you don't know how to do that hyos does that for you uh literally just day one you just plug your data in the hyros and will show you the amount your leads from any type of source are going to spend with you which is why we can easily see when leads come in from Facebook I mean Google in this instance right here from Search terms when they come in from Search terms the value per call is about $1,500 these convert a lot higher and they spend a lot more with us I think the quality of customers from search is just higher now the final thing I'm going to point out right here is look I want to teach you this right now but I don't know how to teach you this without you tracking it properly you can see right here um just from this search term right here hyros uh the tracking solution I'm talking about right here caught 1,500 calls right here Google caught 452 you can just see the tracking is way off there's huge differences in the amount of calls tracked and so I wouldn't be able to do this if I was using Bas tracking I don't know how anybody actually runs their ads still with base Facebook or Google tracking because it's blocked like Crazy by iPhones and all sorts of other devices so you're just not getting accurate stats so please if you want to actually apply with in this video maybe once you start making money come check out hus and track your ads correctly because you're not able to use or get the accurate value of your customers and you're not even able to see the base leads coming in so please do that now I want to explain the theories behind this and how I make this work so first things first I'm going to show you the keywords we're targeting in this one campaign and it's nothing crazy uh obviously for example hyos my company is a attribution software so we're targeting keywords like ad tracking and attribution software so I can come in here and you can see the keywords that I'm targeting you can see its things like attribution software ad tracking software and I can even come down here and see the cost per conversion on average right here this isn't wildly accurate and I can go into hros and actually see the accurate stats right here but this is good enough to show me which ads or keywords are in general getting us the best cheapest leads you can see ad tracking software is it right here so one thing I want to point out to you if you're watching this I'm doing this at scale right here if you have a new business where you're only trying to make a couple hundred thousand or a million bucks a year you could easily come in and snipe keywords to do massive returns you can get really cheap leads that convert really really highly from the Search terms if you know how to build the ads correctly which I'm going to show you to do so if I was just trying to run a smaller business I'd come and just Target this keyword right here but you can see we're targeting just everything the whole Dogg and carriage but if I really wanted to optimize this I would just lower it to a broad search targeting for just the keyword ad tracking software that said if we come here and we look at the ads I want to show you how I make these so you can see this isn't a very complicated ad I'm going to bring it up so you can see the entire term and I want to show you how I'm building these so what we want to do is one we want to make our ads based around the keyword okay so right now the keyword right here is AD tracking so you can see when I come down here most accurate ad tracking optimize AI for higher ad Roi see highrisk reviews in Tech jet fuel for ad tracking for info businesses and AI optimization for growth now let me explain how I'm using all these together right here obiously what I'm building is you're going to have three of these shows so you're going to see one two three in some instances or sometimes it we'll show twoo so what Google is going to do is it's going to come and grab these headlines right here and place these in and so it's going to require you to write three headlines and it's going to go and place them in here so what I like to do is I want to throw a combination of different types the headlines in there I don't don't want to repeat myself over and over if you look at most other businesses when they're running Search terms they just repeat the same thing over and over again I want to hit them from different angles okay so I have most accurate ad tracking that's obviously what they're looking for right there but what I want to also do is I want to throw in things that are going to Peak their interest and get them to actually click it over other ads so you can see right here I say optimize AI for higher ad Roi and I also have say AI OB ad optimization for growth why it doesn't make any sense it's a little bit vague and it combos in with this ad tracking right here to make them think that we have something that they haven't seen every other business advertising right here is just like ad tracking it's really accurate we have ad tracking mine is like ad tring we have a special AI or ad tracking see reviews in Tech okay and so what I want to do is I want to have something that triggers and gets them to click you can also see I put in something right here tracking for info businesses and if I can go back I'm going to add something for Ecom businesses as well right here because we also want to call out to the type of person that's watching you have you have to understand when someone searches for something they see a bunch of different search ad returns from other businesses and you have to be able to beat those other businesses because they skim through there they're also looking at all the other Search terms so you have to create a a question in their head or an ad that's more interesting than the other people on the page advertising and the Search terms so I'm using the terms like AI optimization and these reviews and Tech to get people to click now what I also do right here is in the description right here I want to add something that creates a story that they're going to want to click I don't want to just tell them like hey we have really accurate ad tracking or hey we have this thing that you're looking for I want to say it's a revolutionary tracking attribution system that combines print tracking plus AI now a little tip right there yes the the type of tracking we do we call it print tracking there and we do use AI to optimize Google and Facebook AIS and everything like that to to get better returns but what I'm doing right here is I'm not really going into detail on those and I'm using a lot of buzzwords like print tracking and AI to get people to go what the heck is going on here I want to create this news story or this type of headline that gets people like thinking okay this is different than everything else on this page this isn't just ad tracking this is something I've never heard about before so you want to make something that seems new they've never heard about before so obviously then we want to attach it to what they care about this allows advertisers to track traffic and scale ads more accurately never before okay so we just created this huge story right here that they're going to make more money we have something they never seen before it's brand new uh and we'll also back it up and prove it now finally what you can see right here at the very very bottom is we have these site links right here let me make sure you can see these so what I use the site links for this is the final kind of finish to the ad is I go and put everything they're going to doubt about this in the ad so I have C proof and results because they might think this is BS or bogus so I put C proof and results and then I need to think about who is most likely to be looking at this ad or be needing this ad so I say increase Google ad Roi increase calls from ads SASS and info ad all right so I I call out the Target or types of different types of customers that would be looking at this ad if I can go back here I'm actually going to change this up to add a lot of Ecom in here because that's where like people are getting crazy results right now with hyros but you can see what I'm doing right here do you see how many different layers of conversation I'm having with the person just in this one ad all right I'm not just saying hey come get ad tracking I'm saying come get ad tracking we have something brand new that's revolutionary it's unlike anything else you see on this page specifically if you're this type of customer and if you think we're both come see these proof and results this is everything I'm accomplishing just in this short little ad and it's all focused around again the search term ad tracking okay so that's super duper duper important you can see this is the ad right here that did the best out of all these ones right here all right there's a few other headline examples right here that you can look at that I was using you can zoom in I think all these ones are really good this is the one that did the best okay this is the one that did the the best so maybe the number one most accurate or using like a headline like that works really well uh I'm sure we can actually go into the headlines and we we can and see which headlines are actually the ones getting the most clicks now I want to show you how we're doing this in a another type of search term that's actually paying off for us really well so first thing I want to show you is how we're doing this for like really broad weird keywords now the cost per call that comes in from this is a little bit higher but also the conversions are are much much higher on this keyword than they are with the with other keywords or even on other AD platforms so what I'm doing right here is I'm running the same exact type of AD as had before but I'm targeting the keyword Facebook ads this is something that has nothing to do with ad tracking and so what I'm doing is I'm converting people that are looking for something else into high-risk customers you can do this with I'm going to give you a few different keyword ideas similar software are softwares in your industry so for example I'm going to go after stuff like clickfunnels or go high level or Shopify okay what type of businesses are running ads and what software would those businesses use what are the things they're trying to do all right they're trying to run Facebook ads Google ads they're trying to make more money from ads they're trying to look for ad strategies so those are all keywords I'm going to look for in your business think about your Target customer and think about supplemental things they're going to look for so for example let's say you were selling like agency services or something like that what are other things that agencies are looking for what other type of content are they searching for online Target those type of keywords so you can see I'm targeting people that are looking for Facebook ads right here and that's obviously where most the clicks and everything are coming from obviously if a person is looking for information on Facebook ads they are going to be someone it's running ads thus they're going to want to make Max money from their ads thus they're probably going to want to use hyros so what I'm going to do right here is you can see I've done the same exact type of ads but I've altered the keywords to focus on Facebook ads so if we come down here and look at these this is the highest converting one scale Facebook ad profit guarantee AI tracking gross Facebook ads you can see I'm using the same type of strategies that I'm using in the other videos now you can also see I'm using the C proof and results and also increase Google ad Roi to also Target people that would also be using Google ads or care about those proof and results but you can see how I'm altering the headlines based on the keyword so that was just something I wanted to throw in there just give you some ideas when it comes to targeting other keywords this works really well for us but the cost for lead is a little bit expensive on it that's fine because again we're getting people in the hos and then we're getting our return on Revenue about 6 months in from when we get them in not every business can do that and you have to have kind of specific tracking to do that that previous examp example that I showed it it was really laser tight that's almost profitable like week one keywords like this are profitable like 3 months in 4 months in and really pay off in about a year and a half which is completely fine for me that's like being able to put $100 in a stock and make like a 3X Roi on it guaranteed in a year and a half and that's that's how we run the business and that's how you want to be running your ads overall the final thing I also want to show you is that we've also had some very very good results targeting ads based around our competitors so what we want to do right here when you're targeting your competitors keywords which we do is one of our one of our chief competitors is a really great company called triple wh I'm not here to talk about triple wh or anything about I think it's a great company I think there's a lot of things we beat them in but I'm not here to like bash triple wh in this video or anything like that I have a lot of respect for the company but of course we want to we're competing here so I want to get their customers so what we're looking at right here is you can see I'm obviously targeting our competitors keywords right here now I want to just show you how I write these ads so when a person's going and Googling these ads what they're looking for is obviously the company that they're searching for so what I have to do is I have to create a story about how we're better than this company and I really have to think about what type of customer we're going to be advertising to right here so for example if someone's looking for triple wh they're probably very interested in e-commerce tracking now there's a lot of ways that we beat triple wh when it comes to really highlevel e-commerce they're absolutely phenomenal at really like small level small e-com stor when it comes to really big ones we have a lot of things that they do not have so that's what I want to lay into in this ad right here so first thing you can see right here is I've actually changed the landing page of the website based around the type of customers that's coming through here so what I focus on right here is communicating that we're for big e-commerce stores and that's where we see the best results because with hyros the most important thing is the long-term numbers and the actual metrics and being able to optimize those fine details and you really don't run into those problems until you're at large scale like 50,000 100,000 a month from your e-com Commerce store and ads and that's where highis really starts to take away because of the better tracking and all the long-term Revenue analysis that we're able to do plus the AI optimization and whatnot but regardless of that you can see how I'm using that to tell this story right here I'm not trying and saying like H Ros Ecommerce tracking that's really good I'm trying to say if you're this type of customer you might want to try us over triple wall in this example right here and so our panded print tracking AI is the highest level of tracking for Ecom businesses for serious High l Ecom um businesses on or off Shopify what I'm also doing right here is I'm telling the story of how we're different we don't just work with Shopify we work with every single Ecom platform and we talk about how we're focusing on High level Ecom right here all right so again you're seeing the same type of site links that we've used in other videos or other ads same kind of strategy with there I just want to show you how we're targeting that a little bit differently than other keywords so those are the three ways and keywords that we're using to get a lot of results with Google keywords I didn't show you all of our campaigns we have running cuz I don't want to give away everything that we're doing and all of our keywords but those are a few really good examples now if you're looking for the funnels and actual things you want to run these ads too again that's all over this channel everything I know about advertising is on this channel 100% for free because I want you to go and get results with your ads when you start making a little bit more money you're probably going to want to track your ads and you're going to think about hro so everything here the funnel the sales strategies the copywriting techniques all below this video as well you want to see how we're running YouTube ads and our scripts there there you want to see our scripts on our Facebook ads you want to see the landing pages we're using it's all there and this is all proven across my businesses and what I'm seeing working across billions of dollars of AD spend by being the CEO of hyos so you should check all those out and I'll see you in the next video

================================================================================

hello internet marketing skis ball I want you to picture something sexy imagine a one-page website absolutely dog content almost nothing on it and all you have to do to print millions and millions of dollars is just send people from ads to this website it sounds unimaginable but extremely wet and moist doesn't it and I hear you thinking to yourself no Alex unfortunately I have to actually put effort into my business there's no way I could just do low effort piece of sh no effort work empty scuzzy little websites and print money if I would I could I am a piece of sh but unfortunately the internet keeps making me work for my money well hold up back up what I'm going to show you in this video is a onepage ugly as website embarrassing has almost no content on it whatsoever that I ran for almost a decade and it printed tens of millions of dollars for me an absolute joke and when I talked about low efforts SC well I was able as a 20-year-old who was just getting wasted and drunk and hitting on women all the time to build a multi- multi-million business just off of this simple website and running ads to it and in this video I'm going to show you the website I'm going to break down how it works the entire marketing business strategy behind I'm even going to explain the ads to you a little bit but there's tons of content all over this channel explaining all my best ads so we're really going to focus on this with the context of running ads to this now how do you know this works before we get started how do you know this investment of five minutes in your life is actually going to give you an Roi well I have some really good credentials first off I was the drunkest 20-year-old in existence to make millions of dollars while running ads to single page websites I've already told you about that achievement but I've also used the strategies you're going to see in this channel to build many eight fig businesses a nine fig business and on top of that I'm the CEO of the world's largest or one of the world's largest ad tracking companies that gives me basically insights on what's working across all advertising across billions of dollars in ad spend so in short I've made a ton of money and I get to see how other people are making a ton of money so if you're looking for a source of information on how to make a ton of money with ads you should listen the up cuz what I'm about to show you right here absolutely prints money so let's get into it so what I want to do is I want to show you these Pages now these pages right here do not exist in a vacuum what I'm going to show you in this video is the pages and how does business work that generate a ton of money so that you understand how this relates in terms of ads now if you're looking for the ads the scripts and everything that goes along with this to make this work with ads it's through my $2,000 Mastermind I'm just kidding I don't do that just go on this channel all my ad scripts everything I've ever learned about advertising is here in hopes that you use it to make more money and then when you actually start making more money from your ads you decide to track them and not run ads like a drunken baboon and use my ad Tracking Company hyros literally we guarantee your ads make more this is why Tony Robbins Alex hosi Playboy bodybuilding.com Pier One pudgy Penguins everyone that's cool

all my image ads all my Facebook ads that go along with this are all on this this YouTube and they'll be linked to at the end they're link to below this video let's focus on the content so I'm going to show you a series of pages right now that just printed tens of millions of dollars and they're just embarrassing as you can see they're very simple ugly Little Pages like this okay and so you're probably looking at these pages right here thinking how could this print money how was this even a business and these Pages alone yes I did have like Standalone business websites in the past where I'm like in a suit and like look how professional a look and stuff like that that doesn't generate any money these little dumpster diver pages right here this is where all the money is I didn't even need to if I could just go back in time and and binge drink more I would do it and I'd be able to afford to even more efficiently because I could just run onepage websites like this and print money so I'm going to explain to you how to do this and if you have an existing business using these Concepts right here will get you more leads it will get you more customers in door if you don't have a business or you're like trying to learn how to like build one properly this is going to show you how you really need to get the fundamentals right and that's all you really need to generate money and most people don't get the fundamentals I'm the fundamental king that's why I can just be the idiot that you see in these videos today and still print money because I I got the basics right my layups my granny shots are phenomenal in in in marketing terms so first let me break down the business model that worked Oho very well here and this is something you just need to focus on your business and just really build deep inside your body so when a lot of people run ads on the internet what they're thinking about is money in money out and that's obviously the end goal but you're going to see that the smartest people and the richest people they play this game in a really weird way or long-term way where they focus more on gaining attention and rapport with people and that's the currency they're trying to build up and then later on that's when they really reap the rewards it's it's kind of like you're growing crops if you would just put a seed in the ground wait 10 minutes and then try to harvest it you're not going to harvest anything really but if you put a sea in the ground and water it for a year and then you wait for it to get all confident and big and then large and then cut it off at the root that's when you're going to harvest the most and so you got to really think about that way with your business so the way any business should work whether it's e-commerce or or SAS or or anything that makes it incredibly easy to run and build is you want to focus on Rapport first and building that Rapport and being able to contact the person so look in order for someone to buy something from you like let's look at Brian Johnson's olive oil let's talk about that for a second Brian Johnson is making Just sh tons of money selling olive oil this is a product that you could literally go to any grocery store even a gas station and buy right now yet he's selling it probably like a 3X markup uh it's olive oil it's just you put on your your your bread at Olive Garden where they serve olive oil so how is this guy doing this this why are people going and paying him 3x markup because they know him they like him they trust him they believe what he says and they believe because of this the quality of his product is better now I I actually buy Brian's olive oil I like it and I don't even know why I buy it to be honest I don't know why it's better than the olive oil at Whole Foods but I I go have it shipped in and I I take his olive oil daily because of this mothering thing right here all right so this is how damn important is it can even trick me it can even even make my lizard brain do whatever um the person trying to get me to buy something wants me to do so you have to understand online that the thing you really want to focus on first is one building this for poor people in order to do this you have to be able to contact them efficiently so when a person comes to your website what we want to do is we want to get their email or contact information this is a no-brainer but but if you do this already on your website you probably do you've probably ran a lead gen funnel before please listen for 10 seconds because I'm better than you at it and I have understandings that you probably don't have that make me much more efficient at this than you do so look we want to get their email information and we also want to slap a retargeting pixel on them now if we can get their phone number uh that's the CR CL because then we can just annoy this person for the rest of their life maybe even get their address so we can send them those huge giant pamphlets in the mail that spam and fill up their mailbox but we're just really going to focus on the email and the retargeting right here so so why do we want to gather these things right here okay so what we want to do is we want to get their contact information and we want to get them to primarily view a video or start getting to know our brand specifically if they're our Target markets so for example if someone's not interested in Health and Longevity getting them to watch a Brian Johnson olive oil video isn't going to do much so we have to get the target audience there too which is where the ads come in okay so look the way to get people to these pages and a way to start this this this type of contact is of course by getting them there now there's ways you can get them there organic content making yourself famous uh I'm going to use Brian Johnson as an example in this video I talked about acne creams and everything in every video this video we're talking about olive oil all right but the best way to get them there is going to be a organic content like I'm creating for you right now I'm creating all this ad content everything for you to brainwash you into buying hyros now you know what I'm doing why am I giving you all this free content but seriously this is the best way to get people there originally but if you don't want to make videos and you're not really good at making yourself Famous online or making good quality content that people want to watch or you're not extremely good-look like me you're probably going to have to use advertising to get people there okay so that's fine advertising is a way better method you can scale it up faster and a lot of businesses the people I know that make the most money they're all ugly uncharming [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know I'm just leaning into my skill set right here uh you look at most of the people that make a lot of money online they're all like hiding in their their basements of their moms and running advertisements other people's faces and stuff so this is perfect for you so forget the organic content let's focus on terms of ads the best way to get the targeted people there is if you can run a very tight funnel is getting them there with ads you get their contact information you get them to start digesting your content and you follow up with them forever through emails and additional content and re targeting ads that then sells your products and gives them more content and over the long run what you want to be doing is you want to spend maybe you know $5 to get a person from an ad onto your big list okay and then over time you want to generate 30 50 bucks from them over the span of a year so for example this business model I'm going to show you right here from advertising it cost me about $5 to get someone on list and over the span of a year I'd make about $30 $50 back now how do you track all this back to the ad you use hyros for example I can see anybody that comes into certain funnels or whatnot in my businesses I can see exactly how much they're worth over time you can see these numbers all increasing over time so I can track back to the ad exactly how much money the people are making for me and how long it's going to take for me to break even on the ad and whatnot okay so that's a very efficient way to do it and again if you're using Facebook ads or Google ads like I always tell you the tracking the tracking is not accurate so for example right here I'm just checking a call funnel that I'm tracking right now Facebook caught 61 calls hrus ad tracking caught 147 calls that's a massive difference if I was running ads off of the data on Facebook I'd be running ads incorrectly and making way less money so please keep that in mind when I talk about all these things you're probably thinking how do I track all these things and do this this is how you do it that's exactly why I invented hyros because I had this exact fing problem and I had to use all sorts of wingding ghetto rig solutions to go and track this data right here now you can just paste hyros code in your site and get all this data easy peasy but anyways this is the world's most Alpha Superior business model I don't care if you're using if you're running an e-commerce business an info business even a SAS business a software business kind of like I run at hos you can see I'm taking a little bit of a different route here by hitting you with Organic content and then I'm going to be retargeting you after this but it's a little it's it's the same exact process except what I'm doing right now is the final evolution of this is more of like the middle tier beginner level that is going to work best for most businesses and entrepreneurs so bringing this all in what we want to do is we want to run ads to these types of pages that we're looking at right here so I'm going to rip this one off of Adam Dukes who ripped it off of me I I don't have a save copy of this page because I'm a very disorganized person I have no access to any of my old templates or anything I used to build because my computers get so infected with viruses and crap that they explode every two years so I have to start over from scratch every time so thank you Adam Dukes I'm going to rip this from you and you ripped it for me so what he's using is a template I used for the longest time so what you want to do to get people into your business is you want to create a lead magnet now I'm pretty sure you already know what a lead magnet is or maybe you don't that's either way it's fine because you're going to learn something here you can see this super duper ugly page right here is dirt ugly simple now I want to show you I'm going to I'm going to plow this also looking at at something that's just working today so for example if you look at um Alex mosi's site um I think e probably has one of the best opt-in funnels or lead type funnels for these type of pages online right now so we're going to look at this compared to this here in a second but what I want to show you is just this simple framework that I've used for almost every business that I have to get people to do what I want okay so you can see that I have this basic ugly page right here I've said it a bunch of times I just want to emphasize how little needs to be on the page a lot of people put big professional pictures of themselves a big complicated looking website even if you look at the hyos website right now yes it's big beautiful has all this crazy stuff on it but the core concept of the landing pages that people land on is this the reason why my highrisk website is very Advanced and bigl looking is because we're trying to work with like really large Enterprise companies and big agencies and there's a lot more song and dance to get someone to buy a product that cost3 $50,000 per year for high-end businesses it doesn't cost that for small businesses join but when people are making $50,000 buying decisions like you got to give them the whole pamplet feel and deal okay what I'm trying to do right here is I'm just trying to get a person's contact information I'm not asking for a credit card I'm not asking them to do anything crazy I'm just I want their contact information and so what we want to do is we want to lower the friction here as much as humanly possible so you can literally reduce your websites this and you use these three different types of lines or these four lines right here to get the job done so the first line of any page you want to have right here is you want to call out to the specific type of person so case study video for successful marketing agency owner so you want to describe what it is and who it's for okay what it is and who it's for hey do you run advertising you want to make more money or something like that who it is and where it's for now what you want to do is you want to put something right here that describes what they're going to get now I actually hate this headline right here I don't think it's good okay so what we what we want to do is we want to tell a story in our headlines that doesn't make any sense but needs to be solved so right here this person right here how I generate 69 dolls and my markting agency last week this is boring this doesn't create any mystery so if you look at this headline right here on this page you can see I'm doing the same thing how print train training my ad pixel AI doubled conversions while cutting ad spin so what's the difference in what's going on right here nobody knows what the print tracking means nobody even understands what their pixel AI is so why am I saying these things in here if people don't get it because their intended thing that they want right here is to cut ads spend but they want to in order for them to take action I have must make them believe I have something that they don't and so having these mixed up words right here and these these little Loops makes them think okay this guy has something that my business doesn't have okay now the best thing you can also do right here is you offer them something that's even more a turnkey so what I did actually with these ads that worked very well when I was building a business where I taught people how to build uh marketing funnels and stuff like that I used get my landing page template so what people believe is even better the thing is going to get people to give them their information so you can Market to them and so on and so forth and by the way if you want to see what goes into the marking everything I send to people afterwards all that that's on that channel as well it's linked below this video there's nothing I'm talking about this video that is left out or be some pay wall for you I just can't include every marketing lesson I've ever had in one video so check out below this video if you want to see how I build the funnels and long-term content to monetize this type of business so what I'm doing right here the best thing you can ever offer in these type of funnels is a template or widget or app or something you can download to get some instant results if you can offer people a win button that will get them to opt in every single time that's why I like templates or script or an app something like that like anything they can download and get results with something they don't have to learn they just slap on their site or something and get some instant results that's why if you look at hyos for example one of the reasons why it sells so well is because of the marketing persuasion I use on it that you just slap this code in your site and you make 15% more which you do and that's what I designed the product around I thought to myself if if these optins work really well for this type of concept maybe if I make a software like that then it will work all right but you want to tell a story particularly offer them a a win button and then use things that they don't understand to create Loops that must be solved okay so that's the difference i' make in this headline now what you want to do in the third line of these pages is you want to remove everything they hate does not involve blah blah blah blah blah um or what I would use in these examples is for example when I was doing this this this page right here generated tens of millions of dollars by the way three step process you used to build a five fig month online store in 20 days so this this is a really good hook right here because it describes what they want in a very short time frame and an easy to understand format what I would do right here to make this a little bit better is I would do like how I use Chinese gold Farmers to build a five figure a month online store in 20 it has to be just something weird off the block off the wall that gets people like whoa I've never seen this before because a person has to believe you have something that they've never seen before to finally get them to get hooked in now you can see this third volume right here is everything they hate okay so what I did right here is you get this thing without all the things you hate for example in online businesses it's without hard cost or techy stuff back then people didn't want to do technical stuff they certainly don't want to invest money in their business don't ever do that that's actually one of the best ways if you're selling like make money online courses and stuff no one ever wants to invest they they just want to push button solution to make money if you can offer that in my perspective on your sales cop you you can't sell that that doesn't work but if you can get people looped in and then get them the actual what they need which is training and resource and everything that's the best way to get in now you can also see right here on this page what I did is I threw in that whole checklist template thing so putting something like this actually boosted conversions okay so then you can see right here I you can actually ignore the rest of this page very simple button get the email address okay you can see on all these Pages what I have is just a very simple button that then will pop down and collect the person's email address and then take them to a Content video where I deliver red hot crazy content that introduces them to the brand and then gets them to preferably book a phone call or go deeper down the funnel the the funnels for these is listed in the videos underneath this if you want to learn more about how I made a lot of money from these businesses that's there now the final thing I'm going to do right here is bring you to Alex Hero's page now I actually think my headlines and seduction is actually better than Alex's on here but I know personally that this is a really really high converting page and I just want to show you this being used on a very high level um from from someone you probably know so get your free personalized 100 Millions doll scaling road map what is this first and foremost remember where I talked about just a download push button thing they can download to get immediately it's right here all right so you can see like literally a checklist this is what people like like they don't have to learn anything new they just follow the checklist so you can see the same principles being done right here and I just want to stress this page right here is generating so many leads for alks and probably making them actually making them just so much money and you can see exactly how simple this is an application whereas you look at a lot of other people's websites it's just very complicated craziness and you have to understand what you want to do is offer people the quick template the quick push button and then get their contact information and one thing I want to show you as I know this this converts really well for Alex and it's just red hot is how simple this optin is right here so if you can make your optin or email collection areas extremely simple to use that's another thing that's going increase your conversion rate so I just want to show you these pages right here and give you a rough overview of the business model I was using that just allowed me to print if I can tons and tons of money with very little effort and actually not much skill when I was in my 20s I was just running these things left and right my businesses are a lot more advanced now and so they use a lot of different other Concepts to grow the business but you know those businesses bu hrus is a nine figureure business if you want to make 5 million million 10 million bucks a year you can get it done with that type of business page and type of strategy that I talked about now if you want to see the ads that I ran to these Pages they're all over this channel they'll be linked to at the end of this video they're linked underneath this video they are everywhere my YouTube ads Facebook ads image ads my entire ad copywriting strategy all on this channel if you want to see the funnels and the things I was selling to make a lot of money in these businesses again link below this video all over this channel I don't have any courses or anything you to buy because I've already explained why and this video has been long and I'm tired so I have nothing more to say goodbye

================================================================================

hey there you scuzzball internet marketer you sleazy snake oil selling Shiller of garbage on the internet welcome back to my ads Channel where we talk about ads do you want to know the number one thing to make your ads super profitable and make them sh money if you nail this one thing your ads will make infinite amounts of money you could actually become quite rich just doing this one thing well and messing up everything else do you want to know what it is it's making the place you send them AKA your sales pages and landing pages it's making those convert highly and I know this might come as a shocking revelation that in order to get people to buy stuff from you online after they click an that you have toing convince them you you have to convince them well getting a person to click and add is the easy part getting someone to actually believe the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're saying on your website take out their credit card or put in their information or give you their phone number and do what you want them to do that's the hard part because people don't trust you online and they are very very busy and have the attention span of a gerbal so truly the actual most important thing if you want to make a lot of money on the internet via ads you could mess up pretty much everything else in fact running ads is pretty easy right now with the targeting it doesn't take a space age scientist like it used to the number one thing by far is being able to create pages and websites to convince people to do what you want and in this video I'm going to break down a skill set and strategy that has been forgotten to time since genz and Millennials have taken over the internet and no one has the ability to read anymore this is a skill set that absolutely no one has internet marketing and that's being able to write written sales Pages no one can [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do this anymore except for me I'm the only source of information on the entire internet you have just kidding but not really the only information that I can really think up on coming to writing wrden sales pages is back in Old Dan Kennedy books and classic copywriting books no one does this anymore yet if you go to Every website every SAS website every e-commerce website any website online what is going on there people aren't watching videos they are interacting with visuals images text text links the website design and that's what's convincing them to buy and nobody understands how to go and make this actually convince people to do this if you can do this everything will work cuz people aren't watching videos on your websites they are reading and so if you understand how to get people who are reading to do what you want you're going and I can tell you how to do this because I built multiple eight figureure businesses fueled by ads I've built a ninef figureure business fueled by ads I'm going to show you a sales page today that generates 50,000 to 100,000 plus per day in sales and on top of that I'm the CEO of one of the largest ad tracking companies in the world right now hros you should use it if you don't you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] which allows me to see what is working across all of paid advertising to the tune of billions of dollars I see everything that's going on I can tell you what's working what I'm about to show you right here is actually pretty uncommon in ads and I'm going to show you this page that I've created for my business and I'm going to walk you through everything I'm doing that has allowed me to create my website for my business that I guarantee you converts much much higher than all my competitors or similar websites there's only like two websites out there online that I think have really good written copywriting on them for example one of them is clickfunnels because Russell Brunson is a copywriting freak the other one is Alex Hero's website really other good copywritten website that we'll probably review later on we're going to start with my website if you just apply this strategy and mindset that I give you you're going to see your conversion Skyrocket because you're probably just not doing this by default it's like if you were trying to learn how to play soccer and you stop hitting the ball with your hand and getting penalties like kick it with your foot you stupid son of a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that's how simple this is and that's how little people do this so let's hop over let me break down this page for you all right so nor on my business hos.com and this business was recently about last valuation we got was valued over $150 million I think it's worth much more because we've grown a lot from then but regardless of that this is a business page that has generated a lot of money for me it's created a very successful business so you can pretty much assume that this works so what I'm going to do right here is I'm going to break down this page now look I would I try not to Shield hyros too much in this Channel and that might be what this comes across but I put more effort into this page and this website than anything else I have online at the moment so I have no better use case or example to show you so you're also going to have to deal with me subtly Shilling hyrus as we walk through this I want to break down the mythology behind this first so so what we're going to do is we're going to go through these notes that I've left right here in this very badly organized area right here so let's start from the very beginning of everything we need to do with the sales page and we'll go through the actual steps and what the person is thinking so all copywriting is and all selling through written text or video is achieving these goals right here okay so you have to make sure that someone believes or you have to Market to the person what they're looking for these are all going to sound really obvious but people don't do these things so please if you think you're smart and you think oh well obviously you want to sell to People based on what they want okay great why aren't you doing it correctly so there's three things you really have to get done one you have to make sure that the person uh on the page AG is there for what they want and you're selling them what they want and you have to know what they want to sell them so what is the big thing to them you didn't have to convince them that what you're selling is actually for them and is going to work and then you have to convince them to take action those are the three things you have to do that's all there really is but doing those things is a little bit harder than just breaking it down the three things and what you're really trying to do is predict once you have those things allocated okay you have the right person on the page and you're selling what they want you have to predict what they're going to think it's like you're having a conversation with someone and you're trying to lay out a game of chess 20 moves and predict every move they're going to make and everything they're going to think you're not just writing and throwing something out into the void it'd be like if you're talking to a girl or something like that I don't know if you've ever seen pickup artists or people who have these whole scriptive routines to talk to women but what you're trying to again do is predict everything the person's going to say in response to what you're saying so you're going to say for example if I'm selling hyos hey I have this tracking solution it's going to make you more money from ads what's the first thing the person going to say how does it do that how do I know it works then I'm going to give them a response okay well here's a customer that got this result right here and here's how it works well yeah but I don't really believe it yet well here's more testimonials well how would this actually work for me blah blah blah blah blah blah all right and so if you ever look at any sales video or heck when I'm making even videos on YouTube what I'm trying to do is I communicate something to people and about every 15 seconds I think what is the person going to think what are they going to respond what's going to be going on in this person head what's the objection or skepticism they're going to have and then I address that and so I'm constantly having a conversation with someone that isn't actually there that I'm imagining that's the key to copyrighting people just talk to themselves and then they lose track of the conversation they having with the person so think about that as you go through this so we have to think about these things before the person comes on the page what is the big thing and what is the main big thing what you see a lot of times when people come on pages is they try and pitch different things you have to understand people are very short attention spendy imagine you're having a conversation with someone who is using their phone and texting someone else and their wife is screaming at them uh if he their text message so they're very distracted right now what is the number one way we can convince them what is the thing that's going to hook them through because you don't have to hook a person on 15 different things you just have to hook them on their main thing people usually only buy something for one or two reasons for example if you're selling a skin cream uh you could have a skin cream that tightens your skin removes wrinkles gets rid of AC me whatever but what you want to do when you send people to a page is you need to understand what is the biggest fing reason they're on the page right now so if you ran an ad and your skin product does 10 different things but you're in an ad focusing on acne just go 100% on acne scars that's the only thing you have on the page just nail it nail it nail it because you're sending people interested in acne scar treatment and that's the only thing you need to nail you can also bring other things into it but they all must relate back to the main thing so if we go look at this page at hyos what are we focusing on right here scale scale scale and if you go through this entire page you're just going to see the word scales over and over again all the testimonials result to scaling and so at highis I understand the number one thing that people buy it for is because they want to scale their ads they want to make more money yes we cut cost yes we cut waste yes we help the targeting improve on Facebook yes we help people attribute their sales more correctly those are not the number one thing that's going on in someone's said the number one reason why people buy hus or look at hus is cuz want their ads to scale further so what I focus on is how hyos does that and guarantees that result if you see everything right here I tie every feature that hyros has on the page back to scaling so before we even get into the words we're saying what is the main thing the customers came for and then we're going to attach everything back on the page the customer Journey the attribution the AI optimization high it's all going to tie back to that so whatever your product does whatever your features do tie it back to the main big thing and only focus on the main big thing on the page okay next what are their biggest objections you got to collect these beforeand why are people not buying your product so for example at highes people's biggest objection is it's hard to plug in I don't have time to do it I don't believe it works yada yada what you're always going to see 90% of the time is people are going to require more proof they're not going to believe you okay there's the pain or time of setup or use okay and there's the friction to join now friction and joy mean how hard is it to check out how hard is it to get into what you're doing so for example at hyos we we charge upfront you know a lot of times you can remove friction by making it free or making it easy to join or there's all sorts of other things we can talk about as we get into that but most of the time what are their biggest objections proof pain and time of use so have all the reasons why people don't buy and don't complete check out don't make the next step don't believe you and you must attack those okay so why would people not believe that hires can scale their ads why do people believe they can't set it up why are they not joining maybe they don't understand it so moving on to the understand part I just put into can a fourth grader understand it what you must do is you must not just only focus on the big thing you must explain to the person and explain away their objections and convince them of the big thing in a way that is easy for them to understand I see so many pages for example I look at other attribution companies and it looks like a PhD scientist wrote their page I don't know what the f the company actually does or how it tracks or how it makes them more money I go to so many other service websites and like that that's not explain the big thing and it's not making it simple can they understand it can someone look at your page and understand what's happening next we have to focus on what type of customer are they and how do we get sniper info to them so for example at hyos what I do and what I understand is that first everybody that comes to this website wants to scale their ads but I have many different types of customers as do you I have e-commerce customers I have SAS customers I have people that run info businesses I have people that track phone calls okay and so hus has very specific functionality for each of those type of businesses that makes our tracking Superior for them but what a lot of people try and do with their products is they try to Market them all at once so they have e-commerce features they have infom marketing features they have testimonials that are for all different types of business models this is not what we want to do here once we convince people that it can scale what we want to do is we want to send people to specific information so what you want to do on your site is once you have let's say we have a skin cream okay what we want to do is we want to convince people that the skin cream works and then what we might want to do if we don't go for the sale right away is we want to send people to relevant information that applies them so maybe they're interested in skin tightening maybe they're interested in acne scarring um a better example with this would be on a B2B website where you're trying to make the business more money okay so on that on that skincare example right there I would just go straight in and the acne scarring like we talked about or whatever the main thing is and then maybe maybe narrow it down to more specific things like blackhead scarring or um I don't I don't know the specifics of skin care scarring to be honest uh potholes sunburn damage something like that and you could narrow it down to that if the person needs more information okay so an example of that just thinking off the top of my head is if you have the sales page for your skin cream you could actually have it like what is your biggest problem Sun scarring acne scarring you got hit by a baseball bat I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know you then link them to deeper parts of the site to get the more information or you provide information based on that so as I go down here after I convince the person yes it will scale you the first thing I'm trying to do is get them information based on their specific needs okay so for example if they're like in e-commerce I'm going to show them big e-commerce brands that are getting results I'm going to show them how our cogs and the way that we attribute the entire hard cost of goods all in one place while attributing higher for scaling is going to help them more if we're doing call tracking I'm going to focus on how it's able to connect the call to the close months later and connect all the backup sales and all the attribution from the sales reps to one place you can attribute that back to your ads that's what I'm going to focus on based on the customer and I don't want to just Chun it all in one page I want to Route them there so if you can see when I go and click on features at the top of the page how we split up by features now you might have noticed I'm not talking about any written sales copy yet I haven't gone to like called Dan Kennedy how to write a sales page I'm you what I'm talking about right here is how to structure your website there has to be a logical flow to how people are going to behave on your website if you go to any other website let's just go like look at MailChimp or something something like that and the reason why I'm using MailChimp is the more corporate and large a business is the more aloof and stupid their websites are so like look at these look at the website and just TR an email and SMS in the revenue get more op clicks to your email marketing this is all fine but like look how many different directions is going right here like on the page itself just all over the place Solutions and services like it just like there's it's just so much information now this is a terrible example cuz I'm terrible at making content you can probably MailChimp is like this big Enterprise giant service and when you get to the size of this you're probably going to need all these these crazy winging extra features right here I'm just saying that a lot of smaller businesses more like hyusis size or B2B businesses or other businesses that are are not quite the level of MailChimp they're all over the place with all sorts of information if you can look at the hyro website there's really nowhere for you to get lost you're going to find exactly what you're looking for and there's nowhere else you can get jug into other sites have like their whole entire site listed up here 10 different places you can go there is very little places for you to end up based on your business model on here okay so are you looking for the features are you looking for results I'll I'll bring this down so you can see the taskbar right here and there's really no other place for you to get lost okay so we want to direct them to the sniper information that's related to them on the page and then finally what are the key concerns specific to this customer that's very basic if I go right here and I click on e-commerce you're going to see a page that has only things that are related to e-commerce you're going to see we're using e-commerce Brands like Playboy uh we're using e-commerce influencers like Matt Smith and we're showing the results of e-commerce stores and focusing all the features on here with their specific business models like we connected to Amazon you're not going to see this on the info marketing page so that's what we're going to be looking at the sales videos everything right here like the biggest day in in e-commerce is Black Friday so I focus on videos that show we increased profits by Black Friday or on Black Friday by 60% for a lot of users so this is what I'm going to focus on but if I go right here on the SAS page completely other different stuff we're focusing on Mr and how this ties in the ARR and how we actually track LTV back to ad so different problems for different customers but the main focus of the entire everything is always scaling this is going to be about how to scale your e-commerce ads and so you have to look at the train of thought what's going on right here so if we go back and look at this let's go back and do this from the very top and then let's look at how we do the copywriting on the page so what's the topic or problem what's the big thing it's scaling okay everything on the hrus website or anything on your website should focus on the main thing again this isn't a pitch for hyros I'm explaining how I sell hyros so you understand how to sell your product this is Apples the apples you can copy and paste this method over to your product so what's the topic or problem what's the big problem for the customer scaling that's the number one thing that's important to people that will potentially use hus they want to make more money what is the number one thing to your customer okay so the first thing a person is going to think then is this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't believe you this is the number one thing and then what's going to happen is you sell to anybody on the internet every 30 seconds they're going to think this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't believe you until you've smashed any form of skepticism out of their mind so you're going to see on the page here's the big giant result and there's a video very quickly breaking down like how we get it with hrus and so I love these little gif animated videos at the top of websites because people don't watch videos cuz they have the ADHD of a crazy chimpan on qu ludes right now it's they don't they don't watch five minute videos they just can't do it okay they also don't read long forms of text they read chunky chunky text just like the way they read Twitter and Instagram and so what I do is I make gifts they very quickly show them exactly what they're going to get and focus on the most important part which is scaling all this ties back in the scaling shows the most important features so I love using these at the top of websites because they're perfect for ADHD people now the first thing a person's going to think is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm like well here's Tony Robbins using it it's obviously probably not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] here's like a billion other brands okay moving on so that's the first thing I'm going to do you want to get endless proof and so what I do also is I put trust pilot on here um and then also there's people that their number one thing to buy is just going to be proof which is why you should always just have a results page so what we have at hyros literally if the person is just wants to call [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on me all day I just have an entire page being like no here's like a billion results testimonials people making more money here's endless videos here's famous people here's normal Brands here's whatever this is why it's also really important you build something that actually works so you can do this if your product doesn't consistently work you have tons of bad reviews online you should really address that first um a lot of people are be like what if I don't have a lot of testimonials and no one gets results with my product fix that first okay you you'd be shocked how many people that's like their main problem I know it's crazy but building a business that actually works and gets results and makes more money than they pay you like that that is actually one of the big Keys the business and behold um but anyways just endless results and I give people results in every type of format that they're looking for this is essential for copyrighting because people take in results in different ways so I have videos showing them how it works plus endless results I have more traditional here's a review site oh you don't believe review sites here's normal people oh you don't believe normal people you think we copy paste it here's famous people uh that we could get in trouble for posting on here if they didn't say these things they they mess us up like Dan Henry message me and be like hey I didn't say that well you know that this is true well here's also like thousands of people also use our brand here's a bunch of other famous people you know here's people just like you so I'm thinking about the person watching the page like maybe it's an e-commerce person well here's e-commerce [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] all right maybe you're an infom marketer or maybe you take calls well here's the person getting calls this is why you always want a results page you should just always have a giant results page for your products or anything on your site okay cuz there's all people the number one reason why they won't buy is just proof of results then after We've Ended endlessly proven that it's real they're going to think okay it's real but what the how does it actually you know get me these results what we then want to do is we want to explain in fourth grade format how it does it so you can see I don't like write a long biography like a lot of sites do and like all the scientific things hus is the highest level of AD tracking it's just big simple chunky text now it requires zero changes to your business you paste our code data accuracy Skyrock your ad scale you can see how I just explained the product in three bite-sized chunks okay so this right here I love this type of format on a page because it just this is how a person reads this is what it does it doesn't have any of the things you hate it's simple to use we guarantee it that's the entire pitch on this page and I repeat that over and over again and you can see how I'm communicating with the person so let's let's go through the conversation we're having scale your business I don't believe you well here's trust pilot and here's how it works okay but I still don't believe it well here's Tony Robins okay maybe it's kind of real how does it actually work well what it does is this is how it gets you the result and by the way it doesn't require any of those things that you hate and your ads will get this result if you do this here's the result you'll get again this is all you have to do it's very simple it's push button and we guarantee it well that sounds really cool but I still don't believe you okay well here's more here's more results H okay so this is the conversation we're going back and forth with the person you can see how I confirm results every couple seconds as the person Scrolls down so the person might still need a little bit convincing on how the product actually works so what I do is I always break things in the threes because the human mind works in threes one thing there's no Trend two thing there's not a trend three things there's a trend five things it's over combobulated so I try to keep things in threes and fours threes preferably so at this point the person probably needs more details so what I do is I repeat the same exact process over again here is how it works okay here's the result you're going to get boom click here continue more testimonials now again three ways where we'll increase your Adar why again the person's more interested in scaling another set of Threes so what I'm doing at this point right here is I've gone through what's the big problem we've addressed it how do they know it's real all right I know it's real but how does it get me this we've broken it down right here all right and then what the person is going to think next is okay I've heard thought about this in the past but I've never done it so the reason why people never use ad tracking is they think it's complicated it's going to be hard to set up you can see that's why I focus on it being simple Now hrus isn't incredibly simple to set up but the amount of customer support and how simple we've made a system it's by far the best support and simplest there is online which is the main reason why people never set up tracking so think about why don't people use skin care products why don't people use your gym products why don't people use your courses why don't they why don't they use your service why Haven they done in the past what is the thing that stopped them other than the money or the the financials of it you want to address that as you go through the page in these patterns you can constantly see I'm constantly addressing that it's way easier to set up than anything else once we've accomplished these things you can accomplish this on your page pretty quickly you can see I accomplish all these things within a few Scrolls what we then want to do on our pages is get people the specific information immediately immediately so what I didn't do the rest of the page is really focus on repeating this process I go and give people information specific to them and then I I focus on a few more features that are based around scale and then I show them more proof and then I try to get them the features that are specific to them because really what happens with hris is they come to this page and they get finally convinced that we'll make them more money but how will it make them specifically more money this acne product will um stop your acne but how it will specifically stop your forms of acne because you have specific problems so what are your three most common types of customers if you have an acne product or something like that B2B I don't know so I get them to the information that's related to them so these are all of our most common types of customers there's also again just at the top hey do you just straight up not believe us here's results so we get them to for example e-commerce and then I walk them through all the results we got for e-commerce stores all the specific procs how we're the only ones that track Amazon Tik Tok shop all that and we're able to track the LTV and subscriptions and all their cost in one place and we dig into that kind of stuff right there and so we get them and I repeat the same exact process that we did before what's the main problem to an e-commerce store they want to scale but they also have these very specific little tiny problems in their business as well this is where we get into the minute now that we actually know who our Target customer is and we got a very specific customer to a specific page now we can start drilling down on their specific needs finally what the person is going to think last as of all is okay but where's the catch what's what's the risk to me here I have to give you my credit card and I'm going to have to take a big risk what I like to do here is I always like to offer a crazy guarantee to get people um across the board and and when it comes to purchasing so on any of my businesses I just offer crazy refund guarantees because if your business let's imagine you have a lifetime refund guarantee of your of your business if 20% of people are refunding your product you really have something there's there's a problem with your product you should have really re low refund rates regardless and refund rates shouldn't tank your business okay so what I like to do is I just like to offer crazy guarantees risk-free guarantees of their business that's the easiest way to remove the catch if you can't do that find some way to remove the risk for the customer on your page then finally the person's going to think okay I'll come back later cuz no one wants to reach into their pocket and take out their credit card give them some reason to act now the price increasing some limited scarcity or just double triple down on pain I don't really like to use too much scarcity or specials or promos at because then they stop having effect in the future I do do specials and promos there a lot of you internet marketers have like tons of false scarcity on your websites and whatnot that works by all means if you want to treat your customer like an idiot and your customers are idiots then do it okay I used to do that stuff in the past I stopped doing it because what happens is people can't Coy to that or your specials lose their effect in the future you only want to use specials or go for the crazy right hooks every now and then that's my two sents that what I like to do to get someone to take action now is I like to just really double down on the pain for example at hris they're just losing more money they're losing more money on ads there's absolutely no risk you can have this set up tomorrow and if you set up tomorrow you'll be making more money today you're choosing to make less money and lose money if you don't set up right now something like that just remember this is the process of the flow of the conversation so I'm going to post this in the description below this is the process and flow I follow with every sales page sales video everything in fact if you watch my YouTube videos or even these videos especially in the first five minutes I'm constantly assuming the person wants to click away so for example on my crypto videos what people are really reallying into and come into the channels they want little micro coin picks they want me to pick coins for them throw coins at them and then they uh then they buy them and a lot of people come to the channel supposedly because they want to catch the coins early get into the coins and then dump on people who buy the coins from the channel I'm fully aware of this in the crypto channel so what I constantly do is I use that promise that I'm going to pick coins the string them along to the actual important content that I want to pick out and I constantly knock out their objections at the beginning of the videos by showing the proof of the results of the coins I got so the people get hooked and they stay through the video and actually watch the content the good quality content I want them to watch for the promise of these coins that I constantly use in the hook so really if you watch the Youtube video the sales pitch is to get them to watch the end of the video okay so you can use this in any form of persuasion whether it's getting people to watch videos to opt in to buy products from you this conversation happens over and over and over again so you can use this process and virtually anything this is how you do it in the form of a website which is by far the most important thing because the thing that sells everything you have the thing that people return to organically the thing that people browse around from when they're thinking about buying decisions and they didn't buy from your ad initially and your initial ads page is your website most people don't focus on their website that much they focus on the ad or the initial page they land in and they don't think about how people are interacting with their websites or how they view their brand and it shows so use this I beg of you if you like content like this subscribe and you should use hrus also because of all the things I talked about it's if you run ads it's so stupid not to be using it we guarantee the result and uh I'll see you in the next video

TITLE: I'm Using This Image Ad To PRINT Money On Google ($1000+ A Hour)
VIDEO ID: NjBqA5aHSdc
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjBqA5aHSdc
================================================================================

all right you dorks I'm just joking you're not dorks you're really cool edgy guys look at you so look I got a lesson for you today bite size that is going to print money and by print money I mean this is something we recently started doing at my businesses and the ROI on these ads is higher than anything I've ever seen and combined with it here's the here's the fun point it's super duper cheap to run even if you're a complete beginner in business I think this is probably one of the first ad methods you should use because what it does is it allows you to gather a ton of people and build rapport with them so they already know you okay so it's not like they're some stranger and they're just getting hit with your face on the internet you get a big collection of people that know you and then you're able to advertise them super cheaply and in a way that no one else is doing this reaches people in much more Target way results in super cheap clicks and the ads are super cheap to run and they convert like absolute crazy so that's what I'm going to show you how to do in this video and if you're skeptical of all don't worry I'm already extremely rich I have no info courses or education or masterminds to sell you because using ad techniques i showing this channel I've built multiple eight figure businesses I built one nine figure business and I'm also the CEO of one of the largest ad tracking companies in the entire world which allows me to see what's working and paid advertising across billions and billions of dollars of AD spend so in short you could go to a lot worse places to getting your your ad info from I know the presentation on this channel is dumpster quality but trust me the info it's it's good it's going to work and talking about info let's talk about what we're going to talk about today so if you've seen my video on retargeting people that watch your YouTube videos I broke down how posting YouTube videos on the internet and then retargeting people that view those videos with YouTube ads is insanely effective and that is still true you should still watch that video and if you want to get tons of people to actually watch your YouTube videos and at high clickthrough rates I actually released last week my entire video that breaks down how I do my thumbnails which has got me massive success in other niches and if you look at this channel as far as paid advertising views go we get some of the highest views on YouTube and this channel like a month old so this really allows you to just that's looks like fisting it allows you to do inappropriate things it allows you to smack around your Niche very uh very well awkward but what I've recently D stumbled upon puts this on steroids so look there's a giant problem with YouTube ads right now and it really is specifically focused around B2B and in higher quality type of customers which most of you want I assume so the problem is everybody has YouTube Red that has any amount of money no one no one is not paying that 12 bucks a month to not skip YouTube ads I pay it everybody has it so you really get kind of cut off at the hip like 90% 70% I don't know the exact percentage of people you want to Market to are going to not be seeing ads on YouTube which is a big problem if you want to retarget people to watch your YouTube videos but I found a really nasty workaround that I have been using to just drain money from you guys watching the I'm just kidding but not really to just absolutely Bank off off these videos I'm making here on YouTube and don't worry I'm not going to be selling you something you're going to see an ad for me here pretty soon but it's going to be something that's going to make you more money because if you just apply the lessons and AD tactics I give you on this channel and then track your ads with hyos you are literally guaranteed or you do not pay for it going to see a huge increase in your ads because lo and behold tracking your ads and not running them like a drunk pirate allows you to run your ads more efficiently and get more of your customers so that's what I'll be selling you in the future but I'm just going to help you right now there's no catch but this has been working for crazy like me on this channel the few other businesses I've shared this with no one's really doing this I don't know why it worked like crazy for them and what it involves is using the ad Network that nobody ever uses which is the Google Display Network no one ever uses this thing so last video I talked about how to create really high converting image ads and that video is linked below here I have no paid content it's all for free on YouTube and that's going to show you the same exact techniques I use to create images for gdm what we're going to focus on here is just simply the application and understanding this method so let me show you how this works first in my terrible whiteboard of Justice all right so here's how this works it's really simple one you want to use my techniques that I shared with you last video to get tons of views on YouTube okay I've broken down an entire video talking about how I make my videos how I make people watch them how I get really high watch time that is linked below and then also how I get really high click-through rates and make my thumbnails get lots of clicks that's linked below so if you want to get views on YouTube that is all there and trust me you don't have to be entertaining you just have to speak in patterns and sales patterns like I do in these videos to make you watch dogit quality content for lots of times to boost I'm just kidding the content here is good but the way I speak in these videos and the way I do all my videos even my videos in crypto and everything it's all following sales patterns and hooking patterns to get people's watch time as high as possible so watch those you could just not run ads at all and just be a degenerate who only tries to sell through free traffic um and that works totally fine and you could just use that method but this right here is much better so you're going to use those methods to get a lot of views on YouTube again link below in the description totally free on YouTube now what we want to do is again I told you the big issue I'm seeing is specifically when I'm targeting you guys on YouTube um when you watch these videos is most of you guys at least the ones that aren't poor which is the ones I need to get on the hyos nobody's spending $10,000 a month on ads uh that is that is out of money but everybody has YouTube Red so no one's seeing your ads that has any bit of money to their name so what we're we want to do instead is I discovered that look you can block my ads all day on YouTube but unless you're one of those dorks who's using an ad blocker um you can't block it on gdn and so what I've been doing is just running tons of gdn ads and this has just been getting us the cheapest calls and the highest conversions at hyos in in other business I've shared this wor it's working like crazy so let me kind of show you how this works okay so we're inside the account right now and I want to take you inside this campaign right here which is one of the ones and I have a few different Google ads accounts this is just one it's not all the ads that we're running but this is one of the ones right here that's targeting people that view our YouTube ads and you can see the cost per lead right here is just astoundingly low the cost per call the people coming in it's a joke um you can see this like here's standard retargeting of people that come to our website so these are all the people that come to hyos here's all the people that just view a YouTube video one of these ad videos so you see we're just getting crazy low okay you can see even when we're like running normal YouTube ads it's like $200 per call I'm getting them for 1/4 that right here now if we go and look at this one thing I want to point out to you very quickly is if you look at the amount of conversions that Google caught right here it caught 11 conversions when I actually had 33 so look I'm not going to sit here and Shi hyros to these this entire video I don't think I have to when you're seeing this stuff in your ad manager and I mean you're going to see the same exact thing in Facebook you can see the amount of leads we caught 49 to the 10 that Facebook caught right here look if you're running ads in anything and you're using Google and Facebook ad tracking metrics you're not getting your conversions in you're not seeing all your customers if you're working off of bad data if I was using this data right here I wouldn't have the results to report to you I wouldn't know to scale AKA I'd be running ads like a drunken baboon uh if you actually track where your sales are coming from and then optimize for those sales coming in you're going to make a ton more money so by all means please use this method and then when it makes you some money make it make you more money by actually tracking it correctly and seeing your results so you can optimize around your results I don't even have to pitch it just you could just compare the tracking and then ask yourself how am I going to get results when I can't see what's getting results how can I optimize for it so Nob brainer anyways if we go into these ads right here I'm going to show you some of the ads that I'm running so first and foremost all I'm doing right here is I'm just going into the audiences and you can set up basic audiences in your shared Library okay so I'm sure anybody that knows how to build audiences you you know how these work but you can just go to YouTube users okay I can name this something that is memorable to me like poo poo fart poop okay that's very memorable I will we'll have that in the back of our head forever and then what we're going to do is we just select our channel uh I can do any of my channels right here we're just going to do business roids and viewed any video in the past 30 days 540 days and what I like to do is I create two audiences one that's just 540 days and then one that's 30 days of course the 30 days is going to be better a 3-day one is going to be better if you're trying to be as cheap as possible do it on the lowest time frame possible obviously the cost uh per lead is going to go up as the days increase so I would have three audiences 3 days 30 days 540 days the three days is going to get you the best results but it's going to be the smallest audience so that's how that works so then what we're going to do once we have that set up is we're just going to go and run ads to these people it's that simple so you can see I have two ads right here what I like to do is primarily uh I showed you my image ads with like the text and everything and then I'll I'll actually be breaking down another group of image ads later this week that is just killing it for us so again subscribe to the channel uh stay tuned but you can see right here what I'm going to try and do specifically for retarding ads is is if you put your face in videos you can see these are also just trash ads like I can make much better images for this but if we go look at these images right here so here's an example image right here and what's kind of funny is this is obviously set for Black Friday I just was been I've just been super lazy testing this and so you can just see like I just have this like promo image up right here so what's the lesson to take away from this right here one put your face in the image if people see your face in videos that's what people are going to recognize okay and then I just like to usually use something that's triggered by scarcity because if you remember last video when we were talking about image ads we're not primarily trying to introduce the brand to them or uh create a cold ad right here the person if they are watching your YouTube videos and you've already introduced what your product is so for example in these videos I'm not like hard selling you hros or anything like that what I'm doing is I'm teaching you and getting you results and then suggesting you get better results by using our phenomenal product but I'm not like buy hyros now buy hros now hyros is great and doing a hyos sales demo right now so when you guys see this ad in the future you're going to see my face you're going to recognize me because you've watched me in the videos probably recently and then I'm going to have something like I'll never do this again and soon and I'm giving you a reason to act on the things I talked about in this video so there's a prep sale or whatever going on on and so that's going to give you a reason to click that ad on gdn of course you could just run run-of-the-mill cold ads um like our other ads that we have right here okay I showed these ones to you last video this one has worked really really well for us but that's not going to be as effective to you right now because you're going to see you don't know what my product looks like you don't know what hos primarily looks like right here and um and while this ad would be effective because you are interested in ads I'm running it to having an ad where my face is in it and you direct ly recognize me from the channel um is going to be super way more effective and what this is also really good for is because this Builds an email list for me another ad type that we've seen has worked very well for this it's even easier to run is going to be the Gmail ads and any other type of AD you can run on the Google Network that is not YouTube again the primary issue with YouTube is one everybody's using YouTube so it's very expensive and two uh anybody that has any amount of money is using uh has YouTube premium which is really bad for it but this allows us to just go and build a giant email list of people and I can hit you whenever I release a special or anything like that I can hit every single person to watch my YouTube videos with these gdn ads I can hit you in your email inbox with these ads and because you've watch these you're familiar with me and you recognize my face it's extremely effective so I don't think there's much more to add to the strategy other than this as I just showed you from our direct results we're just getting leads and calls so much cheaper doing this and uh it's cheap than running YouTube reting ads and is even getting better results than people that have visited our website so what you should do my suggestion is you is one use the blueprint I have for YouTube videos that's linked on this channel to get long watch times on that side of the algorithm then use the other video below to learn how to get high click-through rates and good click-through rates on your thumbnails and headlines combine those together you get lots of people viewing your YouTube channel and whatever Niche you're in you don't need a lot of people so for example on these videos I'm getting like 5 10,000 views on average that's not a lot of views in terms of YouTube and ads ad content is like the worst lowest viewed content on YouTube it's very hard to break 10,000 views of video it's just there's not too many people running ads which is fine because those 10,000 people if I get 20 30 customers at highis per video we're doing phenomenally well the average value per customer is like $3,000 to $10,000 per year so we're making hundreds of thousands of dollars per video just using this simple little tactic right here so in your Niche if you're doing like makeup or Cosmetics or protein powder and you're like the workout Niche or any other bigger Niche like that you get way more views using the methods I talked about here use this exact tactic right here no one's using gdn correctly these days it's like the most ignored ad Network that actually works and then it works so that all being said everything you need the supplemental content I mentioned is below this video I'm releasing videos about twice a week on this channel one time a week give or take subscribe because the tell you just straight up works I'm using stuff that's just going on in our ad accounts right now on on top of that we end these videos in the most awkward way possible so you can look forward to

================================================================================

hello there do you run Facebook Google ads or maybe even put up YouTube videos and no one clicks your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] well it's likely because you're ugly and I can't fix that you're a 5 fo2 Goblin your ugly parents produced an ugly kid it's not going to happen I pity you hence why I'm making this video right now to give you the blueprint I use for images across Facebook ads Google ads and YouTube videos to get better results than videos you're probably running video ads on Google and Facebook and you're not getting the clickthrough rates you want this image added blue PR right here beats videos right now you are going to get cheaper clicks you're going to get people to your site at a much lower cost and they're going to convert much higher in fact I've been replacing most of my video ads with this and you can listen to me on this because I've been running ads for almost a decade and built multiple eight figure businesses in fact I built One n figureure business all fueled by ads and if you need proof what I'm about to show you works you can check out my YouTube channels not just this one but my one in crypto that have reached millions of followers and the reason why they're able to do this is because I'm exceptionally good at getting those red hot clicks my thumbnail and headline system I'm going to give you right here will allow you to slap an image in a headline anywhere on planet Earth magazines Facebook ads heck even at your cousins Bar Mitzvah and people will not only just click it but they will buy in higher volumes or do whatever the heck you want them do watch a video stay on the page read the sales copy opt in I don't give a f you'll get them to do it with these image ads and as an added perk you won't even have to make video ads anymore you can just be a lazy piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] load up Ms paint slap some crap down and you get higher click-through rates than all your friends they'll be very impressed they'll come to you and go wow that's great that that's a great click-through rate you got there and you'll be like yes I F know I copied Alex Becker his works so without further Ado I'm going to get into this and this is something you have to learn because what I'm seeing at hos right now and if you don't know I'm the CEO of one of the largest ad tracking companies on the entire planet is I'm seeing image ads taking over and actually replacing video ads in many instances and like I said before if you know how to do this you're going to get a lot cheaper you're going to get people to your site a lot cheaper you're going to be able to put in no effort because you're using image ads which is fantastic we're all for that here we're all lazy saxs as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and you'll be able to stand out cuz everybody's using video ads and ugc ads right now this right here is different so let me break it down so let's begin now it goes without saying after a person clicks the ad a lot of other things importantly have to happen okay they have to go through the right funnel they have to go through the Right video Sal scripts there's different video ad scripts you can actually use to set up these ads better on YouTube and Google the targeting the whole hoopla there's a lot more to advertis than just making cool sexy images we get it which is why below this video my exact ad funnels my ad scripts my ad targeting the exact type of procs and type of funnel I like to use it's all here on YouTube listed below so after this video and throughout this video I'm going to mention a few other tactics which you can watch below it's all given away totally for free I have no info products or education course or Mastermind to sell you I'm already extremely rich I don't have to do that my only hope here is that if I help you make more money with this content via your ad you're going to think to yourself maybe I should track my ads maybe I shouldn't run my ads like a drunken baboon because if I track where my sales come from accurately I'm going to be able to optimize my ads and then get more of those sales cheaper that's common [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sense we all know this when you make more money from this content I'm going to give you you're going to come and use my company hyros to track your ads to thus make more money from your ads we in fact guaranteed or you don't pay for hyros so that's my theory here I hope it works out so let's talk about these image ads and why we want to be doing this so on top of giving you my exact blueprint right here that works on YouTube it works on Facebook it works on Google heck you can probably copy this over to Tik Tok if you want but imats has some very unique uh benefits the first one being you can be a lazy sack of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and make these work you don't have to shoot video ads you don't have to do anything and these are actually beating video ads in many instances the clickr rates and people looking at them is just it's better in a lot of instances the reason for that is with image ads you're really able to get your entire message across and less than five seconds which is going to get the click okay and this is super important in many instances because getting the click is 90% of the battle getting the attention and expressing everything is 90% of the battle so this is why I think it's been working a lot better and then three it stands out so right now everybody's doing video ads I'm sure as you scroll through Facebook heck I can go do it right now if we look through the video you actually see one of my ads right here's the video at ignore that but you can see they all blend together into one just giant hoopla of something you've seen seen before nobody's really running images right now and if you notice when you drive through you stop to look at images like this a lot like stuff like this you don't look at this you look at stuff like this stuff like this like this is what gets people to look at stuff on social media right now people's attention spans are so short that image ads really played this better than even a 5-second 10-second video ad so let's go through the steps to making a really good image now the cool thing about image is you can Mass split test them very easily you can change the colors you can change the text of them rapidly it gives you an advantage you wouldn't naturally have in video ads but I want to show you this technique being used in the most high stakes form of image ads to Art which is YouTube thumbnails because when you put up a video on YouTube you have one shot at the headline you have one shot at the thumbnail yeah there's some split testing features on YouTube but they're dog they don't work so you really have to get it right the first time meaning you got to know what you're doing and so what I want to walk you through through is the techniques I use for thumbnails on this channel and my other channel and as you can see my channels greatly outperform other channels if you look at crypto channels for example the average views there is probably like 50 to 100K I get about 500,000 views per video if you look at this Channel and advertising the average view on channels in this space is about 3,000 5,000 views we're getting 20 50,000 views a video right now I'm going to explain to you why this is happening because if you understand this you can make phenomenal video and images jzs and you can also apply this to your YouTube so there's three steps to this one there's the trigger okay and what the trigger is is what gets the person's eyes on the image and what we want to do is we want to disturb the person in some way okay whether this can be making them mad giving them a punchable face which I'm going to talk about here in a second turning them on a little bit to playing a little bit with their dopamine systems making them feel judged shamed or some type of emotion we have to put an image on here that makes them feel some type of emotion whether it's disgust Amusement interest it has to be something that triggers them okay then what we're going to do is we're going to create curiosity not just curiosity but targeted curiosity all right if I wanted to get everyone's attention on YouTube and get them to click I could make a thumbnail with a a girl with a big rack and put she made 6 million on only fans this month everybody would click that not only are they triggered by the picture of the hot girl but then they have the story right here how the heck do she make $6 million and they're all thinking I hate her so they're all going to click it but then when I start talking about advertising on my video Channel or talking about cryptocurrency they're not going to watch it so we have to find a way not just to trigger curiosity and interest to get the click but we have to get the right people clicking and then finally we have to create a story with a headline that must be completed if the person is our target market okay so what I mean by this is I can create anything a story like hey girl makes 6 million on only fans how did that happen that that's great that's going to get a click but that story headline isn't something that's necessarily going to need to be completed by our target market for example at hyos I have to not only catch a person's attention but I have to catch the attention of someone that's interested in running advertising if I'm going to run these ads I have to trigger their curiosity and then I have to create a story that a person who run runs ads will then click on which is again actually being able to run your ads correctly and makeone from them and make a much higher Roi from your ads which again I'm not going to shamelessly shill you hyros too much in this video but I don't see how you expect to make ads work when you can see right here if I'm tracking calls just for hyros right here on this one ad account you can see in this example Facebook caught 32 calls hyros tracking caught 61 Facebook tracking caught two calls hyros tracking caught nine you can see tracking is off on Facebook and Google by 50 100% in some instances Base number one thing you have to do if you're running ads is know where the sales are coming from so you can turn off ads that are not working and clearly see the ads that are and then scale them up with your true numbers if you're not doing that you're wasting are losing 20 30 40% of your potential profit from ads so please as I teach you this image technique that's going to make you more money from your ads you should go and make even more money from your ads by not running them like a drunken pirate and actually being able to track your real results and real numbers so you can actually scale these things so let's talk about this thumbnail on our Biz roids channel that just did very well okay and this applies to all the thumb THB nails they on my crypto videos and everything this is the core concept right here so why does thumbnail do very well there's three things that are happening right here there's the trigger there's the Curiosity triggering text in the image and then there is the headline what a lot of people do when they're running their image ads or creating any images is they try to do they don't try to do these steps in order and they try to convey way too much um at a time without actually uh engaging the target so they're going to put images that try to tell the story their their headline text is going to try and convey way too much information or it doesn't convey the right information and their headline doesn't trigger a click you have to use each part of the image as its own targeted sniper like action so if you look at this image we have to start with the trigger the trigger is Whatever Gets the person's eyeballs there so in a lot of examples right here what I like to do in my videos for example is I like to make a very punchable face okay whenever I used to watch YouTube there was this like 18-year-old YouTuber had like broccoli hair genen Z as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] very annoying looking kid and he'd always have faces like this in his videos and I wanted to punch him at all times but what was the result I'd stop I'd look at him I'd hate him and then I'd look at the damn thumbnail and then I would go and look at the headline and I click his video and I at least watch it for a few minutes it worked the kid was getting millions of views in the marketing space so that story aside what I'm going to try and do with all my videos is I like to give them a punchable face that just works for me what happens is a person sees this and they get triggered they feel a little bit of anger resentment some type of negative emotion that gets them to then read the story of the ad now for triggers you don't just have to use a punchable face you can use for example if you ever saw those images ads back in the day there'd be a picture of like this weird farmer um you know with his shirt off in a field and it would say like the IRS hates him he found a way to break the system once for all and Escape taxes on his farm something like that the trigger on that was the weird guy with the Pitchfork and that that ad sounds so played out and so generic because it worked for so long for a decade you could just run that ad and make money okay and it used the same exact format we're going through right here so what you want to do is you want to use some image that triggers them another good example that doesn't involve faces or people is I saw a weight loss ad and they got like a bunch of eggs egg yolks all together and they put them all together so it looked like fat or something and then they put like that in the image and that Drew people's eyeballs to the image because it was disgusting to look at so I want you to think about you're going to have to split test this and use different things and certain triggers will work better than others but think about what image can I put in my ad that will draw a person's eyeballs to the image first that's priority number one get the eyeballs on the ad the face right here Eyes eye contact also very important because people are drawing the faces and eye contact that all works very well obviously you could go and throw like a hot woman or something on here but what I'd also suggest with these triggers is don't use something that they see repeatedly for example if you put hot babes in your ass everybody's seen hot babes and it's not probably going to create the best thing for your brain so think about this split test different triggers now what I want to do with the text as well is I want to do a few things I want to trigger them create some type of emotion and then I want to create a story a provocative story that they then must get the answer to all right or creates a question in their head creates a question in their head pequs their curiosity and I must make sure it's getting the right people so let's look at this headline right here hey stupid obviously triggering run sexual ads obviously the sexual word right here triggering okay um it's very provocative these two parts right here create a very provocative statement that gets the person hooked okay but then when we say run sexual ads then sell this this calls out my target market right here obviously this makes it very clear that this video that they're going to see is going to be about advertising and selling things so what I've done is I've captured the attention of everybody I've created a provocative story that then appeals only to my target audience and then reels my target audience in this is the goal of the headline that's in the image all right there's a headline that goes below the image that it's about to get the click but what we're trying to do right here is we're trying to get their curiosity peaked and filter them and make it provocative so they actually are interested like their curiosity is very peaked out this statement right here creates a lot of curiosity now this is finished by the headline of this video which is I explain an ad funnel that makes me $72,000 a day and so what does this headline right here that is going to go below the video I'm sure you've seen ads on Facebook and gole Google I'm sure you've seen YouTube videos you're watching one right now you you look at that headline last and that headline what it does is it creates the story that they then must click to finish I explain an ad phunnel that makes me $72,000 a day so what has happened I caught the person's attention I hooked their curiosity and filtered them to make sure my target audience and then I presented them with a story that they must complete this ad funnel make $72,000 what's the ad phone how do it work that's an extreme amount of money how is he doing this and that's the end position I want my target user in they're going to click and then they're going to watch the video now of course the video then has to heavily relate to the story and all the imagery I put right here of course the ad has to relate to that and for example you really want to make sure that your image ads and your landing pages line up using what I like to call the sell a pizza get a pizza technique that is broken down below under this video it shows how you can make your ads relate very heavily and pre-sell your landing pages to dramatic i al increased conversion so watch that video below this it's incredibly useful for this technique I'm giving you right here but you can see those three steps have been accomplished and if we go over to my YouTube channel you can see if we go look at my most popular videos recently you can see I'm using this technique over and over and over again all right so if we go look at one video that did really well like don't run ads to poor people you can see right here what am I doing trigger punchable face hey stupid don't run ads to poor people what is that very provocative very obnoxious and it's it mentions ads it filters the target audience in and then I explain an ad tactic that made me 150 million at 30 super engaging story let's look at it in crypto okay let's look at this technique used over there and then we're going to hop over to add accounts and break this down for advertising so let's look at some of my best converting videos right here so obviously you can see I'm using similar faces over here you can see I'm using the same technique across the board and you can see when I'm not using a triggering face look at this one right here the face isn't is triggering it's kind of boring okay doesn't not as many views okay not as many views right here so you can see that pattern kind of playing out right here now what's happening right here hey stupid dump Bitcoin buy these very triggering image triggering provocative headline in the text sell Bitcoin these seven crypto coins will 23x by 2025 with a story that then a person that's interested in cryto crypto investing must engage in now let's look at a few other things with these images before we actually hop over to ad images what are what's going on in these images you can see how I am using a very simple background in the images because I want the text and the face to stand out we don't need goodlooking images you can actually see on my business Channel a lot of the images like still have pixels around them it's just because I go in Photoshop rip out the background shuck it out there no effort you don't need the images to look good what we need to do is remember how the person's eyes work and what our goals are we want to get them to our trigger that's it we don't want them to look at a pretty AG go wow this this guy's a great designer we want to lock their eyes eyes locked okay then we want to drag their eyes to the image headline dump Bitcoin big red titles right here okay they go this is what's going to attract them right there then they're going to see hey stupid and buy these that's how their eyes are going to work when they look at this they're going to go hey stupid dump Bitcoin buy these buy what and then they go to the headline because they need more information sell Bitcoin these seven cryptos whatever all right you can see where it's going from here and you can see this this this strategy has been repeated over and over and over again now a few of the things are going on right here if you notice on the face in the trigger I make sure to make it stand out I make it very bright overc contrasted I've gone and made the eyes even deeper blue to drink people's face uh uh attension in I I go and also increase the brightness around the eyes so people's eyes and everything come in and some really good channels you can look at for inspiration for thumbnails Beast mister or Mr Beast if you look at Mr Beast thumbnails he's like the master of doing this when it comes to images so what he's doing the exact same technique but what he's doing right here let me make sure you can see this is for entertainment videos I don't think that headline in the image works as as good as um it does in info or business or infotainment type videos I do like so for example crypto or business videos I want to use text in the image for entertainment videos you can see what Mr Beast does really well right here is again all the things I talk about when it comes to the face all right he lures you in with the face you see the face right here ion overcasted face even if it wasn't his face on there this would reel you in all right obviously because you he has his face in there it's going to get a little bit more attention but same exact concept okay you can even see this face is a little bit triggering it's a little bit like there's something off about it it brings you in all right it triggers you then you can see he tells a story a provocative story with the image in the background you can see this ship right here and then this golden ship it looks crazy it it creates this this curiosity what's going on here the same way the text and my images does then $1 versus $1 million yacht it's a story that you must complete if we go to Alex Heros Channel you're going to see the same exact tactics and Alex is very very well um as far as business videos go so when you look at his videos especially his most popular ones that do the best okay um let's go find his most popular videos all right you can see how he's doing the same exact thing in two different ways so here's the Mr Beast effect right here you got the triggering face you got the money in the background there's some story being told here why is he upset why is he why is he angry why is there money in the background okay same exact thing what really does well here and a really good example of just the text one that I really prefer for ads and info based channels as you can see he has the face right here there's some story it triggers you in it pulls you in why is what's why is his expression like this obviously Alex's brand is a little bit different than mine mine is provocative triggering and obnoxious his is not so he's not using the same type of punchable face but you can see this sell to the rich right here this is very true triggering right here this is this is a triggering headline right here obviously it's going to attract people that want to sell things and want to make more money and then he has a story right here in the headline you can see how everything works one point at a time so now that you've seen this pattern over and over again let's apply it to ads now the same process works on Google ads Facebook ads anywhere you put up an image with a headline combination this is where it works now the reason why I covered YouTube ads so much is because that's the highest Stakes highest level of this technique when it comes to paid ads you can split test 50 different images 5050 different headlines 50 different triggers you really you really can get it wrong and you just have to get it right once with YouTube you have to get the thumbnail right you have to get the headline right or the video doesn't do well and you just wasted 30 minutes making the video and all you can only upload so many times per week you only put up two to three images so when you're looking at the video thumbnails and headlines on YouTube that is the Super Bowl that is the UFC of image ad creating okay so once we move move over to ads themselves it's far easier because we can test everything so let's look at one of my ads on hyos it does super well this thing craps money it does great now I'm going to give you one little tip before we talk about this I find that image ads work particularly well for retargeting ads because the person already knows your brand and they know about you now there's two different types of image ads we want to use whether we're using cold ads or we're using retargeting ads which I'm going to get into in this so what I'm going to to do is this is a cold traffic ad this is meant for people that don't know what hyros is so you can see what do we got going on right here the thing that I've done wrong in this ad is this image is not triggering this is actually a bad ad and I'm pretty sure I can make this better by making this image better how would I do this what I'd use is the hyros dashboard but I'd put in weird images like show like an ad manage or dashboard maybe put in weird images like a creepy face or you know boobs or something that looks like a turd this is just me being an iMat goof right here but there's all sorts of weird things you can put in a software dashboard to draw someone's eye in you can see how I'm going to use something that's going to trigger people the same way now you can see I'm using the text to create a curiosity Peak that is filtered my ads are scaling so fast I had to take a damn loan one thing I want to point out is I Ed the word Dam in this why using little slight cursives catches attention better General tip for you my ads are scaling so fast I had to take a damn loan it's a triggering statement it's not as controversial or crazy as my um as my YouTube videos but it has the same effect on someone that's running ads why are they scaling so fast why do you have to take a damn loan what what am I missing right here I wish my ads were scaling all this works together so you can see the image drags the person's eye in okay the text right here creates curiosity then they're going to go and check these headlines to figure out what the heck is going on can't scal your ads in 153 test it increased ad scale by 15.3% here's how the big and more important one right here is new data plus AI grew ad scale 15.3% on average this is going to trigger anybody that is interested in making more money in their ads to click this ad and then they're going to go to the page and the whole other marketing tactics like the video sales or the videos that I have selling the copywriting on the page the funnel I'm using which are all linked Below in this video go to the description it's all there that's where all that's going to come into play but you can see the same exact pattern being used I use in my YouTube videos and there's even ways we can systematically see how to improve this because the whole point is getting the hooked creating curiosity getting them to this headline right here and on to the next page and this headline here new data plus AI grows ad scale or grew ad scale by 15.3% on average the person is going to click to complete this story right here and by the way if you're interested in that again yes hyros does that and we guarantee it or you don't pay for it you can see literally in this ad right here as I'm using this hus tracking is beating Facebook tracking as much as 200% in some instances right here if you're not using accurate stats you're running your ads like a drunk baboon so bonus tip actually track where your sales are coming from if you're using base tracking it's not going to cut it you're losing so much money for no reason so again maybe track your ads but you can see the same exact tactic being used right here that we use on YouTube it works this thing beats a lot of our video ads so to wrap things up let's look at one other image ad that works very very well this works well on gdn it works well on Facebook ads say crush it for us and this is a different type of image ad but it's not too different I just want to point out a few things that are key here so this is a remarketing ad for people that already know what hus is and one of the best things you can do when it comes to advertising is using image ads to people that have visit your website almost like an email list because they're so cheap to run you can hit these people so targetedly and you can also dominate places that most people aren't running Adge which is the side areas on Facebook and then gdn people aren't running ads very aggressively or at the same rate that they are as they are video ads that are in stream on YouTube and Instagram that's just what people all lean towards so what's going on here I think you can already tell me if you've been watching this video triggering face brings the person in this is too much ands soon the one caveat here is people already know who I am or they've they've already been the hyos and they don't need to be told what hyos does they don't need to be filtered the fact that they've already been on the H highis website means they're my target audience so I'm not doing the filtering I'm just creating a provocative headline right here this is too much ands soon what's too much it's too soon why does Alex look like he has to poop these all things trigger the person in and get them to read the point of the ad 30% off hos pre- Black Friday prep sale the entire point of the ad is to get them to read this right here they already know what hyros is they already probably know if they're interested or not and all I really need to do is get them to click right now so what I'm doing is I'm not explaining hey this AI improves results or anything like that what I'm doing is I'm saying literally if you've been interested in this it's time to click now and you can see I'm using the same pattern just to express different things it's not about following in a cookie cutter way it's about understanding the pattern itself trigger the person reel them in create a headline or something story that they become curious about use the headline or the final headline text to reel them in On promotional ads or direct ads I like to just use a big straightup click now headline like this one to really bring the person in I'm not really going to rely on this headline or the description too much because we don't need to the the point of the that is much more simple the person's a lot further along the sales process already and so that in this long-winded video is exactly why and how I run image ads I think this is probably one of the most powerful techniques you can use because you can spit out image ads so quickly you can text or test all the colors the headlines images super quickly and if you use them correctly in this pattern I'm going to show you they will beat video ads a lot of the times and allow you to give a have at least a good mix of video ads and image ads which you want to have you don't want to just have purely video ads so this is everything this video has already gone way too long I don't have anything else to say if you want to see the funnels I'm running link below this video if you want to see the exact scripts I use on my video ads as the worked and sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of product at this point they're below as well if you want to see how I make my video sales videos and all the stuff that happens on the page the funnels themselves after that has clicked it's right below this video I have nothing else to say see you next video

TITLE: I Explain An Ad Funnel That Makes Me $72,000 A Day
VIDEO ID: oIX1cPYm-qw

================================================================================

hi you run ads on Facebook and Google and nobody buys your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] or maybe they're not buying your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the rates that you like them to buy your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at and you don't know why maybe it's because what you're selling sucks just kidding that couldn't possibly be it not in a thousand years there's obviously something wrong with the people on the internet there's something wrong with Facebook and Google ads what you're selling is by far the best product to ever exist on Planet Earth it couldn't possibly be the issue and that issue is what we're going to clear up today because in this video I'm going to give you an ad funnel that you can use on your Facebook Google or if you interact with that filth known as gen Z on Tik Tock ads you can use this ad funnel to sell virtually more of anything and I know a lot of people that make ad content promise you that but I can tell you this as a fact because I have more subscribers to them and more subscribers equals better ad know how just kidding the reason I can tell you this is because I've been applying this to my businesses and it absolutely shs money compared to funnels I've ran in the past and if you don't know I've been running ads for almost a decade now I built multiple businesses past eight figures I've even built a nine figure business all fueled by ads and on top of that I am the CEO of one of the largest ad tracking companies on the entire internet which allows me to see what's working across billions of dollars in ad spend per month so if you're going to get your ad knowhow from somebody you could get it from worst sources so what I want to do is I want to break down this funnel to you because what it allows you to do is basically net in tons and tons of customers that are likely to buy your product very very cheap deeply and then once you have these people it then allows you to hit them right in the jugler and do the number one thing that's going to get them to come to your site and buy something and so what I've been doing is I've been running this one two punch combination recently cost per call goes down cost per sale goes down and the money we make the number that goes up which is very nice so if you enjoy making more money from your ads as opposed to less money listen to this it works very well let me show you so look this method I'm going to show you right here is turbocharged by the funnels that I've taught you on this channel and the test monial Gathering method that I've taught you on this channel as well everything that I mention as additional content in this video by the way it's all on this channel for free I'm already incredibly rich I don't need to sell you anything I just want to help you with your advertising so that you make more money and then when you make more money you might want to actually track your ads because if you track where your sales are coming from you can get more of them in an efficient way and make more money which I assume is your goal here so I figure if I help you make enough money here you'll eventually want to stop running your ads like a blind baboon and make more money from them and then you'll pick up hyros that's the strategy I hope it works so hey below this video go in the description get the additional content the funnels the testimonial method cuz I'm not going to cover those in this video because then this would be like an hour long video and I know you have the ADHD of a toddler so I'm going to try and rush through this snippit this bite-sized piece of content to get it to you super quick so the way this method works is you have to understand the Baseline of getting anybody to buy anything from you in there now there's a whole bunch of hoopla you can do you can make a pretty page and have some crazy Spiel texts on it you can have Jessica Alba come down from a parachute and say whatever you're selling doesn't suck but if you really want to get anybody to buy anything it comes down to these two things now this is a very big simplification but one you need their attention Okay need their attention you also need a way to Target them efficiently which it's it's I'm going to keep this at two things but it's technically three so you need their attention or why do you need their attention cuz they're not going to hear you or see you or pay attention to and then you can't sell them [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so that's wrapped up right there pretty obvious but two they need to believe that it's going to get the result that they're looking for now these these seem so simple but everybody F them up a lot of people the reason why their ads don't work is no one pays attention to them and then when people see the ad and click the page they don't believe it's going to get them the result they want in return for what they're paying it's really just that damn simple if you had a skincare product that everyone believ would make their wrinkles go away 100% you could charge $1,000 a bottle like G Peri does if you had a shoe that made people run faster people would pay thousands of dollars for it so they could win their races if you had a product that guaranteed delivered an Roi every single time and everybody believed when they saw your page they they actually truly believe that they gave you $1,000 they' make $3,000 $55,000 you wouldn't have any problem selling your product the problem is that's not the case and the way you're hitting your customers is not achieving these two things with a mix of this targeting Third Secret step right here this what I'm going to show you right here solves all of these so let's start from the beginning so I'm going to break down a funnel that I've been running at hyos but this applies to virtually anything so look this basically has two steps and what we're doing is we're building an ad funnel so what is an ad funnel an ad funnel is basically where you use a series of ads to get a person to a destination because in basic terms when you first interact with a customer and the last time you interact with a customer in completely different states of Minds the first time you interact with them they have no idea who you are or what you do or how you you have none of their attention whatsoever you don't even know what they're into okay and then by the end of it they do know who you are they've probably built some rapport with them and they're in a completely different state of mind and Report with you by the time they see your last ad so what we do is we use ads to build an initial relationship and then we use ads to close them and we go down this chain this is pretty common but the way we're doing it here is a little bit unique so how can we go and get their attention in the most maximal bigly way convince them that our product works this is how so what I've been doing at hyros and I will work anywhere else as you might notice we've been running some really goofy goofy ass ads if you've ever seen for example I'm not going to play all these ads right here CU they're really there's not much to them that I could break down quickly in a video I I copy wrote it and wrote all these ads but if you go and watch them which I'll link to one of them Below in the video it's very similar to The Squatty Potty famous ads you saw back in the day or the ads that purple used to run just goofy attention grabbing ads that really lay out the benefit of the product hey this is hyos here's a funny explanation of what we do we track ads in a way that maximizes revenue and on average businesses that come and use us make 15 to 20% more we guarantee it or you do not pay for it which we actually do if you want to track your eyes you come track us out but very simple that's the goal of this ad right here I want to catch their attention and introduce them to what we do and why we rock at it while setting up a good brand Rapport now this these ads right here are kind of expensive to make you got to have a crew and whatnot you can achieve the same effect of this for example if you've ever seen my my Pikachu ad on YouTube for hyos or you ever saw any of my ads for hcom or info products we used to sell if you can get a $70 green screen you can make funny ads you can if you don't want to be in the ad you can have someone come to your house I guess and read a script for you I don't know you might have to leave your comfort zone just a little bit to make millions of dollars in business I hate to break it too but these ads you don't need to have these high production value ads I've gotten the same effect in ctrs and whatever with just me in a green screen wearing a Pikachu suit or doing something creative and I'll link to a few of those uh lowbudget ads below here so why am I doing this all right so if you look at any AD platform you're able to retarget people that view your ads for a certain amount of time at least YouTube and Facebook I'm not super familiar with Tik Tok ads cuz if I go on that website I I get a case of AIDS almost immediately it takes me weeks to clear up I just don't go there anymore by all means you can do it but what these sites allow you to do is build audiences based on views so for example Facebook is going to allow you to send in everybody that viewed these funny ads now I'm going to go and target people that viewed these ads for more than 30 seconds why do I do this not 30% 30 seconds 45 seconds give or take the higher you increase this time right here the better the audience is going to be but it's going to be smaller so why do I do this I want to pull every single person that is interested in an ad about running ads more efficiently and so the ad is built for maximum attention okay and so I'm maximizing the amount of people that are interested in ads that will view this ad past 30 seconds I just want to build this giant audience nobody who's not interested in ads is going to be sitting around watching this ad video anybody that is is going to see this video and the fact that it's so weird and kind of unique is going to get them to view it for at least 3 seconds so then I have this big old audience right here that knows what we do and what we are essentially okay so all right hirers is that company that tracks ads guarantees an increase in ad spend Roi supposedly they they claim what they do is pretty special and I'll make more money if I use them so where is this person at right now they know who we are they know what we do we know what we promise but there's one thing missing right here so of course on these these ads right here I'm going to link to our website you know and if you go to our website I mean I think we have a pretty good website I've did all the copywriting and everything for these pages I think it's good but this isn't the the secret sauce right here I'm just send the website go find all your things maybe we can get into how this website is designed to convert later on but not right now what we're really missing in this situation is the fact that the customer does not believe in the result I mean why would they they just met me I'm I'm like Hey we're going to make you give us a, bucks we're going to make you like a billion dollars they're not going to believe me right away okay so that's fine because I have them in the Rapport state right now where they know who we are what we do and what we promise great so once they're on this big list right here what I'm going to do I found just works so much better than everything else is just go straight for the jugular with testimonials and then bash them over the head with what I like to call the testimonial page of Truth and Justice so what is this so I want to show you by far our best converting ad okay and this actually pisses me off because I like to do creative things I would love if I could make those big creative um high quality videos and those things converted but they don't really convert really well they just get attention they just get lots of attention and brand Rapport the thing that converts really well is this and it's so simple and it's so stupid that it makes me sad because I just have to do simple and stupid things all day it's simply add getting testimonials from as big and as many people as we can so if we go right here and you look at this ad right here we have testimon some some really big brands at hyros now are you going to have testimonials from famous celebrities and giant businesses when you start your business no you're probably not that's fine hrus is a business valued at hundreds of millions of dollars we've been around for like a decade we've built up tons of testimonials report and results over the years so of course don't expect to have those same results but if you want to see how to get testimonials and how to stack them up very very quickly at your business there's a video right below here that shows you how my exact process for getting testimonials results and famous people and Brands to use your company it's all right below this video so you build your way up to this and you use kind of a testimonial ladder to get to the bigger names and whatnot but I'm not going to talk about that right now cuz there's a whole entire video about it below so if we go to this ad right here you can see we just have endless testimonials from like giant Brands and really well-known people so obviously getting testimonals from really big Brands and well-known people is great obviously what do we want to put in these specific ads right here the most important and most impactful one is again what I just laid out right there but testimonies from your customers that are based around these specific results so for example when I see people running business ads B2B ads they put like customer support was great or wow such a warm great business I really feel successful with this no if you're a business or B2B ads business your only thing you want to have in the ads specifically if they're not from really well-known people if it's from a well-known pear just use whatever you're going to get but if you don't have that and you're giving it from customers it has to be based around the direct result AK we made money if it's B2B if it's skin care my skin is cleared up in this amount of time or what I feel works most of all or best in e-commerce if you can is some type of scientific proof so for example last last week I talked about how people are making a killing selling cotton gym clothes because everybody's getting plastic in their balls from their polyester shorts so our company I saw was doing really well put up a big old study on how everyone's balls are being savagely wrecked by microplastics that's a result right there the result is your balls don't get cancer or a really successful neut Tropic company that I saw back in the day what they did to make their ads appear way more legit is I got a bunch of independent studies and they showed all those results right there and eventually I think they got like a testimony from Joe Rogan so they combine these both together so those are the two things you're going to want to shoot for obviously testimonal from customers you should have those get them from as big as well-known people as you can and then use scientific case studies and backing and whatnot or for a really good example um from like the lower kind of B Toc you can see some school's advertisements where alosi is basically like um on average every single person that starts a school business makes at least $1,500 per month really great stats like that work really well now this is not the whole case of it what we're doing is we just hook them in with report so they know who we are and now we are undeniably proving that we get the result that they're looking for and is important to them now of course when they come to your site there's going to be games with price and how much the result is worth to them so for example if you're selling like a a guitar lessons course no one's going to be paying a 2K for that course unless there's something really special inside it or something whereas if you you're selling a business product that makes someone $220,000 per month you can easily charge them $1,000 per month no problem so again it's based on the products I think we all understand so I'm not going to talk about that but we're proving them undeniably that the result is there and so we have this huge audience of people that are target market have their attention now we're showing them a result and getting them interest what we have to do is we have to get them to click so preferably what you want to do in these ads I'm not doing this this one but we're running a new one starting this week that does is you want to remove all risk and give them a reason or an urgent reason to click the ad this is going to drive your CTR up and then also remove the friction so for example in our new ad when a person clicks it it points out at the beginning of the year people are going to be able to get our new AI Suite which is pretty sweet I'm not going to I'm done Shilling hos in this video let's just get you the content I think you're already sold anyways you'll be buying immediately after this video but what we do is we point out that if they click now they're going to get this upgrade or whatever for free so there's a reason to click now there's a reason to click now that's all that's really there it just has to be a reason to click now you can get even crazier with it like the price increases tomorrow what out but whenever you use massive crazy scarcity for example you see like internet marketers who have a new discounted onetime lifetime price every other week that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] gets old with customers real quick so I I prefer really to be kind of lowkey and just have a very low subtle reason to click and then what I have right here is a guarantee like your ads grow you don't pay you want to have some bold crazy guarantee because you need to have a a big bed on the table moment so for example if I told you I can shoot a three-pointer from across the court uh 50 out of 50 times in a row you say well I don't believe you but I've said okay well here's $50,000 in the table if I go in the court right now and shoot 50 in a row you you have to pay me 50 Grand now what is that going to do because I just put 50 Grand down on the table you're a little bit more skeptical about judging me on there like if this guy's going to put 50 Grand behind us it he probably can do it that's the same thing with refund guarantees you want to use refund guarantees as a sales tactic in themselves so for example at hyros if your ads don't grow by 15% you don't have to pay for it if you don't want that's that sounds absurd so a person's like well if he's going to make this guarantee and they've been around for a long time this crap must obviously work especially since they have all these testimonials so now we're really laying into the person with these results results results and then what we're going to do is we're going to link them to what I like to call the results page of Truth and Justice what is this it is just a obnoxious page full of results so I think I told this story a few videos ago back when I used to sell uh little scuzzy scam products they weren't scams but they were this is about as lowlevel only fans internet marketing as you can get selling W so's on Warrior form woo that was some dark times back in 2012 is 2013 anyways so what are we doing on this page whenever I was on the forums people have these crazy long sales pages with like the the most wingding Dan Kennedy sales copyrighting you ever see you could you could tell they spent like a year writing this thing just oh just the chef's kiss what I would do that I found works much better is I would just make like a a post selling something I'd write like some short copy and then I would just Spam it with results I just Spam there just be pages and pages and pages and pages and videos and videos just like obscene amount you can't scroll past it you're not even going to attempt to scroll past the amount of results this converts so much better than everything else why cuz the only thing people really care about is if they give you money they get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] result if you had a skincare cream like I said that actually got rid of wrinkles and people believed it would do it they'd pay you $200 $500 a bottle for it all day Kim Kardash should be smearing on her butt and put it all over Instagram you'd be crapping money but the thing the reason why people don't buy your product is they don't believe it's going to get them the result that's really what it comes down to or in the rare cases you've completely priced it out of the market so you like have a skincare cream but it's 20,000 000 like no one's going to buy that but that's very rarely the case I'm going to assume most of you price your products at something relative to your industry so let's not Bame in on the price quite yet if anything you should probably be charging more which you can when you use this so you can say I have a sales video here and everything like that and um all you have to do is just go to H highs.com and hus results if you want to see this page just Google it but what do I do here I make the case in a very short video you can see this sales video right here by most standards is pretty Dam damn short it's like 6 minutes most people like 20 minute videos or whatnot and really the call to action in this video is within the first minute and a half what this really is because I don't expect people to watch seven minutes of ads I expect them to watch maybe the first minute so really what I want them to do and the whole entire pitch is made in the first minute you can go watch this video if you want or my video uh sales page scripts are all already on this channel then what do I do I just spend the entire page proving that it works because really people don't need to be sold too much on the features or what it does or all the things about it what they need to be convinced of it's it's going to get them the result they want and then we can figure out everything out out else out on the sales page or then they're going to go if you're not doing call funnels which not every bu business should do a call funnel they're going to go and investigate on the rest of the site now armed with the fact that you really get the result that they want and you have the person in the buying situation right now if they want this result and you do a good enough job explaining the rest of site they're going to buy they're going to book that call so you can see right here all I'm doing is one smothering them with well-known Brands and then showing them just Our Endless amount of customers that are getting results and then focusing when I use the customer results right here what I do is I highlight the money Parts okay all these videos right here what we focus on is money okay so you can see we've even gone and cut these ads down to the parts where the person's talking purely about money money money why because look as as great as our customer support is and as great as everything we do at high resist the only thing you care about is more money and so that's going to be the thing that gets people in the calls I don't talk about how our our highrisk exension tracks phone calls or shows them better which by the way I mean look at this one ad set right here 39 calls tracked by Harris 19 calls tracked by Facebook if I was running Facebook ads right here and only using Facebook tracking I'd have no idea where my calls are coming from I don't understand how you're going to buy ads effectively if you don't know where 50% of your sales are coming from but whatever just just keep running ads without tracking it's fine soft hyro shill I know but we're just going to smash them over the head with results and then what are we going to do after this we're going to complete the trifecta because I'm going to assume that when a person first clicks this result ad they're probably on their phone or something and I don't think people they don't they don't book calls as much as they do from phones and they they don't buy as much from phones as they should or maybe they were in a place where they didn't have their card ready they weren't ready to buy at that time so what we're finally going to do is when people come to this result page right here okay they come to the result page we're going to retarget them with more testimonials and video ads so when a person comes here what I'm going to start doing is hitting them with demo videos more results ads testimonials so what I do that's really effective is we take all of our customers testimonials are based around money and we cut out the 5-second 3 second Clips to where they're talking about money and then we just layer them on top of themselves for 60 seconds so it's just like I made money I made money I made money and you want to do the same thing for whatever your prodct the skincare is like I cured my acne I cured my acne if you have that gym short company I talk about like my balls are plastic free my balls are plastic free I don't have Aids in my balls anymore my balls fantastic wonderful experience I no longer piss blood um anyways you get the point and so this type of funnel strategy right here works like Gang Busters because it focus on the two things that people uh need to buy your product which is attention which We Gather and ability to Target them and then brutally absolutely harassing them with results you do these three things right here and then you make a pretty good do you just do a basically good job on the rest of your website the rest like the rest of your business by the way your product should work I if a lot of people are going to mess me like but Alex what if everybody uses their prodct and gets no results what do we do then [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you I don't have time for this we got to get those results all right so you got to build a business that actually works and so this is the strategy I've been using it's so simple it's so dumb it works like crazy I mean this is this is this builds everything you could just do this like don't do anything complicated just do this now if you want to see the funnels that I'm using here link below in this video or at the end of the video you want to see the ad copy and the ad script I'm using link below or at the end of this video you want to see how I get all those testimonials there's a link in the description at the end of this video everything I know about advertising I just give away for free on this channel because I don't have info courses or [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to sell you I just want you to make more money from your ads and then think to yourself wow I like way more money maybe I should track my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ads and see where my sales are coming on from so I can get them more cheaply and effectively instead of wasting tons of money on ads guessing and then maybe you'll use hyro so that's my thesis but don't stress about that just browse around the channel get some over the good content and juicy goodness apply the stuff make more money from your ads and uh subscribe and then I'll I'll come back and see you next video and we'll talk about some more ad stuff also by the way like 90% of you viewing this channel you're interested in ads but 90% plus of you are not subscribed this channel absolutely F when it comes to ads seriously there's no one on YouTube that has more access to ad data or actively not just running ads but also actively building the businesses the ads go through there's no one that's going to give you better information than me when it comes to getting people to clicky clicky your ads on the internet and then get them to buy your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so why don't you subscribe because I release a video every week and they're pretty good and I don't sell you anything I don't have an info product or some course or Mastermind or coaching program I'll just tell you what I'm doing so uh subscribe it's a good place to be [Music]

TITLE: This GROSS Ad Script Makes Me $10,400 Hour
VIDEO ID: OKLP1Fn2Mi0
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKLP1Fn2Mi0
================================================================================

no you skeptical silly goose the tile this video is not clickbait I'm actually going to give you a six-step script process that I have used for decades at this point since the 80s since before the internet was even created since before I was born this ad script is eternal it's that powerful but on a real note I have used this exact script for almost a decade at this point to print hundreds of millions of dollars online this has worked for me in selling courses and education this has worked for me in e-commerce this currently works for me in SAS I cannot find a better method than this because it's my theory that this is the Baseline of getting a human's attention and convincing them to do anything in a quick period of time there is no process I can come up with no process I've been able to find that makes ads that convert as highly as this and I've just stopped at this point I just literally come to this script every single time I want to create a Facebook Google ad or in these days now Tik Tok ads which makes my skin crawl every time I access that platform interacting with Gen Z gives me AIDS almost every single time I do it but you got to do it they got these days you're going to have to learn how to make Jake Paul your customer if you want to survive in this space but back on topic if we looking for a quick form way to get people to do what we want come to our website and then buy something this cannot be beaten and trust me I've tried hundreds of times I've gotten creative with my ads I've made new types of content I've followed all the hip-hop cool things the cool kids are doing in ads and every single time I come back to this dumb [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's like I have this butter knife that is undefeated in Sword combat and no matter how many crazy things I create lightsabers s samurai swords I don't know something from Final Fantasy this butter knife keeps getting better results and it's annoying because I want to use something fancy and cool you probably to too but this butter knife of advertising cannot be beaten have I talked this up enough good welcome to my channel my name is Alex Becker I have generated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of revenue from ads online and I have one of the largest ad tracking softwares on the entire planet so I can literally tell you what is working across every industry across billions of dollars of AD spend I know it all I'm a genius generational talent I know thank you but on a real note jok's side I sort of have the credentials to tell you exactly what you should be doing right now with ads and as a benefit on this channel I'm an absolute idiot I can't work with processes that are not written in purple crayon so I'm able to break things down for you in a way that's super simple to apply and we'll get results with almost no effort and that's exactly what we're going to do in this video let's hop into this ad script so to kick things off I like to keep these videos super short so after this video there is links in the description and will be popping up in the links after the video that links to videos of these actual ads I mean breaking down these ads so after I teach you how to use the script write you can see it being used in action me breaking it down step by step on top of that a specific ad writing format like word for word is also linked to in this channel as well all completely for free because I'm already rich I don't need to sell you courses or education I simply want you to make more money with your ads and when you do and eventually decide you want to track ads and make much more money from them cuz people that track their ads and see their accurate stats do better that tends to happen you'll eventually come and use hyos my ad tracking software because I've helped you so much with these videos so again take what I'm going to show you in this video then go get the actual step-by-step word for word ad script at the end of it and then watch it applied in action you'll be a ninja within two days in the 2025 by the way happy New Year all right so let's talk about what are we doing here so again the word for word script is linked in the description we'll be at the end of this video I want to give you the theory behind this there are six steps convincing anybody to do whatever you want in a short period of time and what you'll actually find is that convincing someone to do something in a long period of time via a webinar or sales call actually follows this exact format as well but we have to condense this down and AD so let's think about this in a 60-second application which is what we're usually going to be doing with our Facebook Google and Tik Tok ads and by the way I apply the same thing mindset of this to image ads as well it's all the same pattern of persuasion so first things first let's say we're selling anything okay so let's let's narrow it down and get specific let's say we're selling literally anything so the first thing we want to do is attention now this seems stupid and everything I'm going to say is going to sound stupid because it's like kindergarten level simple people don't get it because common sense is missing an advertising it's all over complicated who but everyone gets the basics wrong and it's confused why they suck at this it's like a person who plays basketball but can't make a layup but can shoot three pointers from across the court that's great pal but let's let's just do a little you know second grade layup so attention what is this mean before you even start laying your message on something you have to get someone to stop scrolling on these platforms you have to get them to watch your YouTube ad or at least pay attention to it the first 5 Seconds people see that their eyes glaze over instantly so how do you do this there's a million different ways and you're going to have to experiment with this the first thing you just need to think on is like what will grab their attention you can literally make this the first one second of any AD and then split test it across all your ads you just interject this at the start of the video so what's going to grab a person's attention I'm going to give you a a funny little just quick example of this at hyos 90% of our customers are dudes they're all dudes running businesses regardless if they're doing e-commerce businesses SAS businesses info businesses doesn't matter you know what dudes like pretty girls so what we did is in our ugc videos where we had people giving testimonials our ads where we had people talking about the videos we just interjected any testimonials or speaker SL Avatar that was an attractive woman in the first 5 Seconds video that's just what we started off with so the ad starts with testimonials and the testimonials are introduced by a pretty woman just literally someone saying you got to see these testimonials at hyrus or something like that pay a person on five or five bucks to do it they'll do it boom the ad gets attention now there's all sorts of ways I've seen this Ed so for example I saw like a protein powder and the way they were squeezing out the protein powder had it in a way to it look like poop and it was like in a bathroom so people were like what what the heck am I watching and then they zoom out and it's protein powder and it's not a bathroom at all so they're like oh I I shouldn't be having those dirty thoughts or I've seen ones where they have like a food item or something and it's shaped in like a slightly phallic way or inappropriate way I'm using extreme examples here yes I am suggesting make your your product look like a penis in your ads to catch people's attention I'm not suggesting you do that but I'm using extreme examples here so you understand what your first thought should be it shouldn't be pitching your product or even hooking them with the exal missions it needs to be to get them to stop scrolling uh I've seen various ones where people are selling products about losing weight and they make uh they took a bunch of eggs like rotten eggs that look like fat cells and they have this at the first 5 Seconds of their video or they have something weird or gross playing at the beginning of the video think about that at the start of your videos I'm not saying put something gross or doesn't align with your brand in the first five seconds of your video I'm saying get something that's going to get someone to stop scrolling it can be as simple as a pretty face it can be as simple as something that's kind of gross or it can be something that makes people go hm what like for example I saw one ad where they had like five tall guys line up to like five really short guys and it said like the secrets in their spine and that makes no sense like you're like but you're thinking what's going off these tall guys versus these short guys it makes you stop scrolling and then what we can do is we have to figure out what is important to the user in the ad because this is where we're going to hook them okay so again you got to follow this process when making the ad and again the process the step byep is in the other video after this we want to think about these questions so we can then apply it to the next video script that you're going to get here so what's important to the person that's going to get them to actually take action so it depends on how you're communicating with the customer and what's going to trigger them it can sometimes be pain it can sometimes be gain let me give you two examples of this so if you're like in a Big Industry where it's really generic and you're selling Apples to Apples you have to find something to differentiate your product across other products so for example um what I've seen in the gym clothing space right now is obviously stuff that has polyester in it is bad for your balls or something it gives you Plastics so I've seen Brands using the pain of like hey your shorts are poisoning you and giving you cancer or something like that that's a pain that's going to trigger someone to click if that's important to them targeting these specific people comes down to audience targeting which is also talked about in this channel but you think about that like what's the big one single pain we don't want to list 10 different things we just want to know one big thing or for example in the make money online space when I used to sell courses there the game was always blatantly like make money and we have to tie it in with step three so sometimes it can be just a very simp simple gain from it or a simple offer of gain I really like pain-based ones so for example what works really well at hyos that's going to be most important to the customer is either making more from their ad revenue or not losing tons of money but depends on the C we're marketing to so for example for marketing to a business owner that is not really involved with their ads talking about gain like hey this will instantly make 15% more revenue from your ads which again we're not just pulling that out of our butt if you look at hyos that's why Tony Robbins Alex pudgy Penguins Playboy and 4,000 plus other businesses users we literally guarantee when you plug in h you make 10 15 20% more on the low end from your ads because if you just track ads with accurate tracking you make better decisions your ads make more I'm not joking you can see all the results on the site Google hyos after this you should be using it I'm not going to push hos anymore because we want to get into content but again if you run ads without hus you factually choosing to like make less money and that's our actual pitch in a business owner will stop CU that's what's important to them but if we're talking to someone who's running ads the pain works a lot better so for example we'll talk about how they're not able to see what their ads are generating uh that there's crisscrossing between their ads they're missing sales and so I kind of run ads from both of these angles to get both of these different parties because sometimes we're managing our marketing to add managers and other times we're marketing the business owners so think about what's most important and how you can introduce it to them three this is an optional one but very important with Industries where you're coming in from gain perspectives because everybody uses the same gain if we're talking about something like make money online the reason you're going to stand out on your ad is this step right here what's the thing or bad experience they had in the past so without and or bad experience in the past so for example in the make money online Niche this is this is so important to step number two because everybody's offering a person to make money rich and fast and quickly and whatever okay and also everybody offering it everybody hates and so you have to consider that people have had bad experiences in the make money on life like hey do you want to make money for real without having to invest money up front without a bunch of complicated hoopla something that's really beginner friendly so without and you're addressing all the crap they've had to deal with in the past or for example at hyos when we offer these big gains right here we throw in without making changes to your business and you have to consider the step optional so for example if I was doing with the the clothing example I did before we're talking about polyester giving everybody plastic in their balls um you don't really need to have this without okay because we've already really triggered a lot of pain but a lot of times gain is not good enough to just trigger people alone you need to also throw in them without and so consider that when you're building your ads and scripting them now step number four is we need to be able to verify it okay so let's imagine someone comes up in the street and tells you or first off catches your attention by poking your nose okay it has to be something that grabs your attention might probably scare you on the street but let's imagine a person come up to you and pokes your nose and then what you're going to do is you're going to offer some potential gain without something that they hate or without a bad experience they've had in the past or offer an escape from a pain you usually don't have to do the without part if you're offering or the most important thing is pain and then you have to verify it so how do we verify this how do we get the person to believe us this is the most important thing like what's the most important thing that if you had would really improve their life and that they would immediately respond to if you truly had if you can create something like that then all you have to do is prove the person at works so how do you verify it well there's testimonials of course studies what I find is best is famous people suggesting your product which I talk about in another video on this channel it's the trt ads video and it's basically how I use testimonials to then get famous people to promote our proess how we got for example like Tony Robbins clickfunnels Grant Cardone all those companies and AD managers of those companies to suggest our product that's how we did it if you're curious how that happens but what you want to focus on is things like this you have to find a way to believably verify if you just tell people hey my prodct will increase your ad Revenue by 15% it's not going to work but if you show them testimonials or for example let's say we're talking about that uh e-commerce example with the gym shorts if we show studies on how polyester is increasing it and how studies with our prodct or something show a different result for example Quia one of the best selling neut Tropic products in the uh neut Tropic space or brain Improvement biohacking space they had tons of studies to back up what they were saying or in red light therapy or uh saunas they they would they show these studies and these examples of how it's actually increasing longevity and whatnot very very very super duper important and so the best things you can do is test but the best things in my opinion are testimonials from famous people backed with studies if you're in some kind of uh particularly in e-commerce Niche who do they trust and what information can you get them that is believable and not for you to verify this point right here and at this point you have the person hooked enough to get them to like take action and so step number five is there just has to be a time sensitive reason for them to click and take action now all right so for example at hyos all the time I don't like to use too much gimmicky time stuff um it's just not great for a SAS brand what I'll use sometimes in specials of course the price is increasing soon or something like that what I like to do is I just like to point out all the money that they're losing every single day uh when not using the product so for example they're spending 100,000 a month on ads they could be making an extra 10 20,000 a month if they just use hyros and it's like I don't know $300 $500 a day they're losing just by not using it in e-commerce though or especially in infom marketing where you can kind of be a little bit of a sleev bag you can come up with all sorts of stuff like time sensitive discounts fake scarcity I know you mother all you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] are using fake scarcity you guys are turd we might as well just talk about what you're doing uh webinars where you act like it's time sensitive all sorts of anything just be creative you if you've been in an industry and you're running ads for any amount of time you know every type of form of scarcity there is at the end of your videos have some reason to click right now and then tell them to click you need to tell them to click multiple times when you check out the script that end the video we'll talk about that and finally you have to create the downside okay like what what's going to happen if you don't click and you don't take action out like what's the worst case scenario so for example at hyos I'll talk about how we have this crazy guarantee that they get this result so the only downside to taking action on this ad right now and trying hos would be it not working the upside is you make so much more money without making any changes in your business the downside click this video now we're offering these shorts that don't give you your your your balls cancer and during the month of January actually the next week we have a special discount to people buying their first pair of pant or something like that they come to the page there's timers whatnot and we have a crazy guarantee or every single day you're wearing normal shorts you're poisoning your body a little bit more which is the opposite of why you're going to the gym in the first place and so what we're doing there uh is we're giving them a reason to click now and I'm making their other pants that they're wearing very very uncomfortable so to recap everything we've done right here the verbatim word for word what to say is in the video after this video but what we've done is we've grabbed their attention but by not focusing on any of this message right here a lot of people start focusing on uh this this very poorly drawn uh training right here again we're going to keep the quality super low this year as always I know you guys love it let's keep the professionalism just at dirt bag levels but we don't want to focus on any of this right here below a lot of people focus exclusively on this in their ad without grabbing attention properly and so again you have to consider that if we can just double the amount of people that stop scrolling so let's imagine before had 25% of people stop scrolling we get to 50% by putting something that looks like a dick in our ads I don't know but think about it and crazy ways to catch attention and then split test it if we do that that's just going to double the volume of our ad instantly this is the most important thing right here if we want quick easy no effort results then we focus on what is most important to the person that they would pay for if we had step three if it's a gain benefit you have to remove the things that have stopped them from pursuing that gain in the past and then verify it using these three things right here scientific studies and testimonal from famous people being the most powerful or doing some separate kind of case study yourself for example if you have 5,000 customers track literally the average rate that customers uh succeed at your business for example at school one really good thing that horoi and ovens did with their ad is they pointed out that like on average a user makes $1,200 when they open their school so like that was like across every single thousands of people that use it that's the average that's pretty impressive you want to use undeniable numbers like that studies Etc so then you want to give them a reason to click now and a downside if they don't click whether it's increasing the amount of counts there in their balls or the amount of money that they're losing every single day and that there's no risk at clicking if they come and try hyros or whatever your product is or something like that having extremely powerful guarantees in your business last little tip is one of the greatest ad you can never do and and for your business and your product should work 100% of the time or people shouldn't pay for it so you might as well just have a crazy guarantee in the first place you're not going to grow business by keeping the money of angry people it'll work for like a year and then the angry people build up into a horde of people with pitchforks and then come tear down your business and tell everyone you suck and then it's over at that point so having crazy guarantees is a really good way to get people to click ads and buy and do everything else you want because again there's no risk to them and the reason why people don't buy things is there's risk so this is what I've used this is the format and questions I go through whenever I write an ad in fact whenever I communicate with people at this point in any form of sales process or day-to-day life or even videos this is the process I've Ed you might notice I start my videos with craziness a lot of times if you ever watch my crypto Channel or this channel why do I do that attention what's the second thing I do what's important to you why are you here your ads making more money and how frustrated you are with losing money on your ads and the fact you want to grow your ads without effort and then what I do next I verify I verify and then instead of getting you to click an ad here I just give you the damn content because that's what you're here for what I want you to do is consume the content but I literally use this exact sales process to the start of this video to get you to my goal which my goal was for you to consume the content and enjoy the content in this channel more because once you do that I can slowly brainwash you into properly tracking your ads and not losing tons of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money needlessly from your ads eventually you'll come around if I lather you up sudge you up with enough quality content Jokes Aside though this is the process you use watch the videos right after this video the exact word for word script and then the examples of ads of me doing this step by step like we we'll watch a video over the shoulder of me going through that video ad that's made Millions tens of millions of dollars we'll do that as well and it'll be linked to you right after this subscribe to this channel I'm going to be posting videos about once a week going into 2025 and like always I have a wonderfully awkward exit outro for you

TITLE: The BEST Facebook Ad Targeting In 2024 (10 to 1 ROIs)
VIDEO ID: aDuMhwiOSqw
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDuMhwiOSqw
================================================================================

all right so Facebook audiences that absolutely money audiences that are so good you don't even have to be good at advertising you just copy paste these audiences in and oh chef's kiss you're printing money like crazy that's that's why you're here right and if you're like pretty much everyone else online you have this fascination with finding the ultimate audience that nobody else on Facebook knows about that just allows you to get sales on complete autopilot and it works 10 times better than every audience what's the secret magic sauce I'm going to give it to you in this video and when I say I'm going to give it to you in this video I can actually deliver because I have one little Advantage see I'm the CEO of hyos that means we track billions and billions of dollars worth of Facebook ads and so what I'm going to give you in this video is not just for my personal experience of spending tens of millions of dollars and generating literally hundreds of millions of dollars in results from Facebook ads and Google ads but what I'm also going to be giving you in this video is what I'm seeing working across the entire industry over and over and over again across thousands of businesses and again billions of dollars worth of Facebook ads spent these audiences right here and this strategy I'm going to give you for audiences is going to give you the most optimal targeting now you need to be using the right ad strategies the right funnels and selling the right things that's why there's all sorts of other videos on this channel that show you exactly what's working on Facebook ads right now and really actually working everywhere and another bonus is what I'm going to show you right here also is working best theory wise on Google so you can kind of take this mythology I'm going to show you right here copy it to Google get similar results and on top of that below this video I've linked to the best ad scripts that I'm using for this again these are just on YouTube I'm not selling anything on these channels and on top of this below this video I linked to a video with my exact ad scripts on Facebook that just plain straight up work these are what's working best for me right now I can't beat the conversion rates of these videos and again that's just going to be linked below this video when you get done here because that's essential to making these audiences work and like always this is all for free on YouTube I'm just giving literally everything away I'm not selling you a course or anything like that so without further Ado let's hop into these audiences so what I want to do is walk you through the audiences that I'm using however I run a very kind of specific funnel for SAS that focuses on very high ticket call funnel based sales you probably might be doing something in e-commerce or selling courses and so I want to explain to you the theory behind this so you can apply it to your businesses because this works stupidly well in e-commerce it works stupidly well in smaller core sales and I've used this to sell tens of millions of dollars worth of info procs and I've seen this working across businesses that are doing over $100 million you're in e-commerce and it's really more about how you think about people are interacting with your ads because when you look at Facebook ads in general the audiences have gotten more and more limited for example you used to be able to Target everything down to like what they liked there was way more audiences that Facebook was always updating now it almost does all the targeting for you so you really have to understand how people are interacting with the ads and how to funnel them to audience funnels now we're going to be having my ad account and just one General tip you should be using hyro for this everyone's going to roll their eyes and say oh Alex is talking about hrus again on this channel but I don't see how you're actually going to run ads efficiently you can see it here in hyos with the tracking that I'm doing I'm tracking calls in this example right here and you can see that Facebook in this example caught 84 calls hyros CAU 247 the tracking accuracy of Facebook just isn't there cuz Google and apple are constantly blocking their ad tracking they're constantly messing with how their conversion tracking works and it doesn't plug into your business at the depths that should to accurately track and so you're just not tracking all your sales and you're making wildly inaccurate ad calls off of data that just isn't accurate on top of that you should be feeding these metrics back to Facebook to optimize your targeting That's essential for these audiences because what I'm able to do is instead of using this right here these 84 calls I'm using the 247 calls right here and this is really bad if I'm using these 84 calls because it marks the 160 or so people that are actual calls or customers as non- leads as non- buyers as as emitting it from the data list which is bad because then it doesn't optimize to Target those people so please use hrus tracking or use some type of tracking out there which again you're not going to be able to do all the same stuff that hrus is doing with other tracking but please just use tracking it's essential for making these audiences work you can't pick audiences you can't pick what's working if you're not tracking all your sales and data you're just guessing it's like trying to pick the winner of a beauty contest when you can only see I don't know their feet or something and for some guys that might actually worked just fine wink wink okay let's not the grade degenerate humor on this channel but you get what I'm saying so what I want to show you is when it comes to audiences on Facebook you can really do a lot of damage with just basic audiences you can see for example in this ad right here and this is where you really want to start off at is I'm just targeting people that like Shopify okay so I'm just using basic targeting which is what you want to be using to start off your ads and you can see that I'm just doing Shopify so the first place you're going to want to start is just the obvious places that make sense when you're starting up your ad campaigns go find all the things that make sense if I put in Shopify right here and click suggestions it's going to give me a lot of suggestions I like using similar software similar influencers in the niche similar websites and Brands you can also go super wide with the big basic General audiences you can see right here I'm just doing advertising and marketing but what I'm going to start off with and where I like to begin ads add especially with these big giant audiences is I like to mix them together to make a mixed audience right here it's a very basic technique but if you're targeting an audience of 547 million people you want to layer it and so if you're really looking to get the most of your ad budget you could layer it multiple times so what we' want to do is it would click to find further and I can make this even better by coming down here and layering it okay so I could do everybody that's in advertising and marketing and also likes garyb uh and like and or like Shopify and or like Salesforce so find software and similar influencers as base audiences and then layer those with the big General audiences or you can just triple layer the big audiences on top of each other so for example we could do like seo seo and online marketing so we could layer these together with this and so that's going to give you your best base audiences and you can get a lot of damage done with these now I'm going to give you a little few extra tips we'll get into like the actual ads you should run in other videos but what you want to use on these ads is just pure coldhearted direct response ads So Below in this video is my actual script for cold response ads these are ads where you just go straight for the jugular and try to get them to come on and book a call or book a sale now if you're like a lot of other businesses this is probably not where you're going to make most of your profit at but the goal here is just to break even on these ads or if you're good you can make money on them I make money on our ads because I have a very specific High ticket funnel that prints money with Facebook and now again that strategy will be linked to the end of this video it's also Below in the description of this video but you really shouldn't be aiming to make a lot of money with your first touch ads so I want to explain this to you so you know how to start off because this is where it actually starts getting impactful because what we want to do is we have these first ads that come from Big audiences and what we want to do is we want to start building retargeting list based on this traffic and based on its Behavior now little bonus is if you already have people coming to your site you already have an existing brand you want to move to look like audiences you want to move to behavioral based lookalike audiences more importantly as fast as possible so if we're just using these audiences right here what I'm going to do is I want to retarget everybody that comes to the website okay so this going to be everybody that clicks that and comes to the website and what I'm going to hit them with is brand style ads and a mix of the cold response ads or the cold direct response ads that we used before so the ads we're using here we're going to bring down here here as well we're also going to run brand ads that are better for establishing Rapport because what you have to have in advertising right now to long-term make it work and print a lot of money is you want people to know who you are because you have to understand most people don't buy from ads if you can think back to your buying history for example I bought shoes yesterday online I didn't click ads for shoes I don't get any of the clothes I don't get a lot of software I didn't get anything that I actually buy from ads now you're likely the same I've never very rarely have bought something from a d my entire life 90% of what I buy online comes from researching or digging around are brands that keyword I'm aware of so what does brands that you're aware of mean it means ads and content that you digest passively so have you ever seen like a Geico commercial if I say hey name an insurance company you're probably going to say Geico if I say name an athletic company you're going to name brands that fit in your brain the same way that Geico does if I say name a Tracking Company I want for example people to think of hyros because they're saying these brand ads everywhere okay so I know that the people I'm targeting right here specifically the people clicking this ad for tracking in my examples but any type of business model out there there really aren't that many of them in terms of buyers and people actually buying these things so I want my my brand to be on their mind at all times and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to build an audience off of a few different things and we're going to do the same thing with our standard site tracking so when people click my ad what I'm going to do is I want to retarget everybody to click the ad and I'm going to create an audience based on that so that we're just going to do basic visitors but next I want to look at their actions okay so on your pages for example on our Pages there's a link to get a demo okay or on your pages if it's e-commerce on your pages if it's an info page there's Pages where they get more info or move down the funnel a little bit and so this is very important on our website hyros you can see there's a book Now demo so people go to this page right here now I'm going to start targeting and really focusing on building local like audiences off of people that get to this page right here because this shows interest in what we're doing a lot of people just click here click away might not be the best audience so what I want to do is everybody that clicks a button that shows interest so intent now of course we want to retarget all these people retargeting lists are easy you probably already know about that what we want to do is we want to create local likes off of this and then we create more look likes as we get deeper down the funnel so what I'm next I'm going to do is people that booked a call so everybody came to our thank you page and then finally a loal like audience off our customers these four audiences right here are going to give you the most oomph and you not primarily want to disregard these big broad audiences but you want to get down to this as much as possible because this is where you start getting the edge at and so we have visitors intent action takers and then customers now you should already have these lists in your business if you've been running your business for a long time but this is where you really want to focus on Facebook and really just stop if you can't make these audio audiences convert you're doing something wrong then what you do with these audiences and you're going to see them perform on different levels so for example your customer lookalike audience is probably going to perform the best and this means you can actually expand the lookalike audience to two to 3% audiences or if you're an e-commerce or something that goes really broad you can go much further so what I'm going to do on these audiences is if I see the customer audience at a lookalike of 1% working I'm going to make a 2% if the 2% works I'm make a 3% and you're going to see the results start to theg grade as you make it bigger and bigger and bigger for example in the tracking industry and AD tracking industry you're watching this right now if you look at the views on these videos or other views on ad channels there's really not that many of us the amount of people that spend over 20,000 50,000 a month on Advertising it's it's probably 100,000 200,000 people tops that's a lot of people but you can reach that entire audience base or I can reach the entire audience base of AD Runners on Facebook and you know with a couple thousand worth of AD spend I can reach every single one of those people you can see here the reach if we just go on yesterday and we spent $65 right here you know we only spent 200 bucks and we're able to reach about 2,000 people if I'm doing that in advertising it doesn't take me very long to make sure that everybody in advertising sees this this is a very small campaign right here so it depends on your niche in advertising I'm really going to cap out at the two 1% audiences now if you're in e-commerce it's going to go a lot larger now you just follow that process with all these if you see an audience working just expand it and what I'm going to do with these audiences is usually increase the ad spend by about 20% per day until I start seeing limited Returns on it or the the cost per customer starts to fall apart again if you're not tracking accurately you're not going to see when it starts to fall apart if I'm looking at my ad results right here in Facebook and going off of what it's telling me it's telling me me that my ads are falling apart like day one where as I look at the actual results it's wildly different okay I need to be operating off this number right here and optimizing my look likes and everything off this number if I'm optimizing off of this by default my my ads are falling apart the same applies to you even if you're your tracking looks good on Facebook there's so many more sales you're not tracking and optimizing for that could allow you to optimize 10 times better so again use tracking and so with these audiences right here I'm going to continue to use the cold direct response ads these are ads assuming a person's never seen my brand and I'm just going straight for the kill there's a lot of people that also want rareness ads first so people will put a video upfront of their brand just something giving content or value and then they'll start to retarget People based on watching that video that works very well in e-commerce so just keep that in mind you're going to run all these ads and everybody that views the ad or clicks the ad then you retarget them with a go for the kill hey buy my stuff kind of thing in tracking in my industry I just like to go cold upfront CU there isn't as much noise if you're selling something like a nutritional product there is thousands of different nutritional products out there hyros for example only competes with my opinion two to three other companies so I don't have to get past so much noise in other models you do if you're running like a let's say a pre-workout there are 6,000 other pre-workouts being ran to these customers you're going to need to build some brand Report with them so at this point what I'm do is that I'm going to build retargeting list off of people that visited the site people that have intent and not so much the thank you pages and buyers so I'm going to run retarding ads that have brand appeal to these audiences right here on top of hitting them with the cold ads cuz what I want them to do is I want them to start getting to know my brand over time maybe it's going to take 5 10 ads for them to actually become customers for example if I look at this this customer in a call that came in um yesterday you can see that they clicked an ad days ago and it took multiple ads for them to come in and actually become a customer with hyos you know they they had to actually go and click one ad and they had to click a retargeting ad and they went through all sorts of other stuff going on here so you're going to see I'm looking at ones that are like really crazy you're going to see there's there's people that have to click multiple ads this person had to click four ads before they came a customer so we constantly want to be building that rapport with them so that when they are ready to convert and they get hit with that cold ad that cold ad's going to do the damage that we need because of the Rapport we've built with them over time and I'll get into brand ads later on in this channel I would really Master this cold ad especially if your business is under the $50 million in sales Mark which I know seems like a lot but when you scale that actually comes pretty quickly because you can get to that $50 million in initial sales with cold ads all loan once you get to that $50 million worth of sales and a lot of Industries you've kind of started to run out of people that actually buy from ads and you need to start actually building a brand and they attracting on the people that don't buy from ads because a lot of people are going to see these brand ads for example and then they're just going to look up your website in their own time and then come back and buy which you need to be able to attribute as well again use hyros that's the type of audiences that I'm using IF as you can see a lot of people break down their audiences these big crazy scientific U multi- lawyered by AG group kind of thing you can let Facebook do most of the work for you in these instances the most important thing is how you build your retargeting lookalike list and you're going to have these core lookalike lists on your site you need to be retargeting and creating lookalike looks list of your visitors you need to be doing the intent so for example in e-commerce intent could be people that get to the cart page or do an ad the cart or view more than four pages in the site and of course making lookalike list of your buyers and customers that's going to give you these are probably going to be your best cold response audiences but you need to be able to Branch out of those so that in a nutshell is the big broad overview of what's working on Facebook right now I'm going to make some more videos showing you really specific like micro sniper strategies and specific audience tactics in the next few videos so be sure to subscribe and in the meantime why you just look at the scripts and the funnels that I'm using so you can actually see how we're monetizing these and making them profitable because the best audiences on Earth are not going to work unless you know how to convert them and script the ads in a way to get people to click and actually do what you want them to do so that being said this is the video I don't have anything else to add I'll catch you in the next one

TITLE: This Creepy Video Ad Made Me $16,224,000. Copy It.
VIDEO ID: -1aMZQEiKk4
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1aMZQEiKk4
================================================================================

no you skeptical silly sausage the title of this video is not clickbait the ad I'm about to show you has printed for me tens of millions of dollars and even better what I'm going to do in this video is I'm going to explain to you how it works we're going to watch it together I'm going to break down step by step everything I'm doing in this ad and plus as a bonus are you a lazy piece of of course you are you run online advertising and do internet marketing you absolute degenerate but this is for you because I put this ad up in 2019 it is 2024 if you did not know this thing has been printing money for 5 years and look it's not like I want to keep this ad up I made tons of other ads this thing keeps winning every single time I put up other ads this ad just keeps beating everything else so what you were seeing is the prime Peak Alpha mail on roids Chad of ads this is the best thing I've ever written I don't understand why it is badly filmed it is poorly edited but this thing keeps crushing it and I truly believe if you apply what I show you in this video your ads will crush it too because I cannot make an ad that defeats this thing and I'm pretty damn good at making ads so we're going to sit down we're going to go through it and if you want to get the actual script for this ad step by step it's right below at the bottom of this video in the description I also link to the exact funnel I'm running this through that shows how it's printing money and the things we're selling so let's get started all right so we're looking at good old Alex Becker back in 2019 also just look at the jawline look how much better the jawline is now look at that that aging backwards in Reverse tell your friends but look at this video right here it is absolute junk and the sound and everything on it is terrible but this thing converts like crazy so let's break down everything let's just start from the very beginning all using it you want customers from ads much cheaper in the scale much further our software hyos will do that for you or you don't pay for it okay so let's let's look at this most important part of this video right here this is obviously going to be put on Facebook Instagram or YouTube We're watching in YouTube format right here but if I'm doing this on Facebook this exact same play Works theact same way now if you look at the first 5 Seconds of this video what do I make I make an impossible bold claim that your ads will scale or you don't pay for it this this pequs every single person's interest and if you can say this about your product this is what you should just do because it's like if you walk up to a basketball game or you walk up to a poker table and say I can beat everybody here and everybody goes no you can't and you say okay I'll prove it and you put a million dollars down say I'll back it up with a million bucks everyone's going to be like okay maybe this guy has some game going on here a lot of ads start off with some big promise some big hypey thing no one ever believes it because you're not putting anything behind it so starting it off like this with this bid headline right here this has just worked very well so focus on that that's the first 5 Seconds of the ad that's by far the most important part of the ad now let's Gove on to the next steps no seriously if you put hrus on your website it takes two seconds and you don't start getting customers much cheaper from your ads and you aren't able to scale at least 20% further from using our print track and combining with AI optimization I'll explain what that is here in a second you don't pay for it so let's look at everything just happened in that last 15 seconds of the ad so what I just did there is kind of all the things you want without the things you hate and again backed by big bold claim guarantee so for example right here whenever people think about tracking or anything it it just boggles their mind and think it's going to be really hard and complicated so I say in 5 Seconds of work you just paste on your paste this on your site you're going to make 20% more from your ads I guarantee it by the way highers actually does all these things if you join highis Supply to your ads you make 15 to 20% more because you're using correct tracking and data I know it's shocking that if you actually use correct numbers to attribute where your sales come from you can make more money but it's 100% factual and that's why we can make this guarantee that being said right there again I say you're going to get all the things you want repeat the benefit you're going to grow your ads you're going to make more money without the things you hate complicated work you just smash your button again I guarantee it or I will punch myself in the face the thing is when people put this on their site and use this with their ads they do get those results that's why big Brands like clickfunnels.com so what am I doing right here let's start from the very beginning big bold promise backed by a guarantee repeat the big bold promise going into a little bit more detail and explain how they get this without the things they hate back it up with the guarantee now what I am doing here is defeating the final level of skepticism which is here is all these people that you know doing this what you can do here is like I talked about in I believe two videos ago I'll link to this at the end of this video I talk about how to get testimonials from Brands and Ed at the scale of to bigger and bigger Brands this this is where you're going to be throwing this into and so what I did those first two steps now I'm going to back it up with testimonials from people that they know or at least good testimonials that cannot be disproven or don't look like junk Tomos impact theory.com graos Anon Robins mastermind.com 6 S 8 and nine figure e-commerce Brands like ladyboss.com massive influencers with millions of follow now let's talk about what I'm doing here with these testimonials what I'm trying to do with hyos in this ad right here is I want to apply to all sorts of different markets so I don't want to just show people saying hey this works I want to show people in specific business models that I know are likely to use hyrus so for example I show an e-commerce Market or e-commerce store that's doing very well with us I show Tony Robbins and Dean graziosi infom marketing I show YouTubers that are crushing it with us and so what I want to do is I want to reach out to all the people that I've hooked right here because they have tons of different business models so what you want to do right here if you're doing this in your own ads is you want to think about who's going to be buying your product and what type of different demographics are is it let's say we have a weight loss prod is it people that want to just get that last 2 lbs off or is it people that want to lose 30 50 lbs is it people that don't want to be hungry you can use different types of angles to catch these people in here because the overall arching thing is you will lose weight I guarantee it or I'll give you $1,000 and I'll do it without you having to eat any foods you don't want to eat without you ever being hungry and I can back this up because here's this person here's this person here's this person in different case studies scenarios they got the result you're looking for for and what you want the viewer to do is pick out where they fall into those case studies and you can see this has been accomplished in 38 seconds okay it's again we really want your ad to be wrapped up in about 45 seconds you can see this ad right here goes for 2 minutes but in reality everything else in this ad right here the person's going to click or on in the first 45 seconds okay so I'm not going to dive too much into the rest of this ad right here we're going to we're going to go through it but I I just want you to really focus on these first 45 seconds right here and also if you're on Tik Tok Facebook Instagram reals you're really only dealing with about a minute of time right here so you got to get everything really get your entire pitch in that first 45 seconds you can see I've done that here with the big bul claim backing it up explaining how it works and repeating the big bul claim and then backing it up with testimonials I've gotten that all accomplished here now all I have to do is just tell the person come check it out followers sales and ads leaders like Dan Henry and even one of the highest revenue clickfunnels funnels of all time Alim gy.com they're all using it and that's why I can make a crazy guarant like that because this is real this is working right now and hundreds of businesses are using it and if you're not one of the businesses using it you're disadvantage because you're paying more to get a as of today it's thousands and thousands of businesses but who's keeping count customer than they are you don't got to be at a disadvantage click this ad I'll explain exactly how hos works okay so what did I do there again testimonal testimon testimonials why can I do this this is the thing I wrap it up about we tie everything together at the end of the video big bold claim backed with the benefits without the things you hate here's a ton of testimonials and the reason why we can make this big bull claim and all these testimonal is because this simply works there is absolutely no risk here there's no disadvantage to you using hus because if you click this ad and you join hus there's absolutely no way you pay money no way you walk away without getting results and that right there is how you want to design your products in the first place if you can't make pitches like that it becomes harder and harder to sell your product because the customer has to frontload you with so much trust you want to Stack the deck in the person's favor so that it becomes Unthinkable for them not to join and once you do that you apply this same message throughout your entire funnel which is again why you should watch other videos on this channel you can see I repeat this same message over and over again all the way to the sales call and Pitch the only difference is on the sales call and Pitch we we really apply uh this to the specific person's business we dive into their business we look at their numbers and we we literally pinp pick where they're going to see the gains from for hrus and then we offer them hrus at a much cheaper price than what they're going to generate or gain from it and again if they don't see those results they don't pay for it and that's again how you want to build your business but this ad script right here this first minute script is responsible for everything now if we keep going through help you set as much don't pay for it that being said triple his ad spend for the rest the ad video is I just go andly more testimonials okay now if you go I'm going to give you a little bonus and again that's why you want to watch the videos at the end of this video because it's going to break down the landing page and the tactic and everything that I use right here as well but when I send people this page there was just endless endless testimonials endless testimonials and so that's why this ad works so well we have the big bold promise without all the things they hate backed up by the guarantee we have testimonials from people they know then we have a call to action lying out how there's absolutely no risk in basically reciting everything we've talked about so far there is absolutely no way this is false or anything I'm telling you right here is not true because everyone you know is using it thousands of people are using it and we back it up with this guarantee and again I believe in a lot of my ads I point out how long hrus has been around so if if for some reason we couldn't back up everything I'm saying in this video we wouldn't be able to have that guarantee so I use all these things to make it just impossible for the person to say all right I'm running ads why on Earth would I not least try this I would make so much more money for my business and then once I've wiped out everything with those col actions I just show more and more results and so this works really really well on YouTube because if the person's still sitting around after the ad you're really not going to be able to say too much to them that's going to get them or or add to the video that's going to really affect the ad because in the first minute you're going to have people click away or watch the ad and click you're not going to have people watching five minutes of ads if the person does stick around all I do is I just hit them over the head over and over and over again with testimonials just testimonal testimonials testimon testimonials then when the person lands on the landing page testimonials testimonials Tes testimonials results results results book a call book a call book a call that funnel works for everything and if you're using this in for example e-commerce have a crazy refund guarantee on your product and again show tons of results and testimonals if you have an agency if you have some service where you're doing something for someone and it delivers result guarantee the result just do it if your if your product can't guarantee a result you shouldn't be selling it because you're just going to have trouble uh on the back end later on you'll get the initial sales and then people will be refunding and your business will never be able to scale so you might as well make it be a business where you can guarantee results or at least strive for that because you're going to get so many more people across the Finish Line if you're like hey what's the risk here what what are you afraid it's going to happen I was watching an Alex MOSI video other day because you can get so many more people to do everything you want if you can just keep saying what's the risk here look at all these people that have gotten this result there's zero risk to you if you come in here and try to get this result as well we guarantee it you're going to get so many people across the Finish Line doing that so this is the script and this is the ad that I been using for a generation since 2019 you can see it's badly shot the audio is not great it's just me at my computer laying out the core be bones of what I just talked about anybody could replicate this ad right here and now this is an ad for a business that does you know near $30 million per year if you're looking for a business that makes seven figures per year like just yank this do the exact same thing it's good enough if you want to get a e-commerce business a service business a Consulting business to a million two million a year this is it right here because this is what people want this is what people want to buy you don't need to persuade them when you say here's the clear benefit let me remove all the risk and then also here's a ton of people that you know are very much like you getting the same exact result that you're looking for just that's the persuasion 101 you don't even need to write sales copy CU that's what a person wants so that being said that's the video for today if you have questions post them Below in the comments I'll respond in the first 24 hours of this video on top of that if you want to see the funnel that I'm running it's going to be somewhere around here if you want to see the actual sales Pages the landing pages and the strategy I used for the testimonials which is by far the highest converting funnels you'll ever make it is here as well if you want to see the exact script for this ad broken down in more and more detail it's also going to be linked somewhere right here these will also all be in the description as well subscribe because my content it's it's fire it's juicy it's moist it's I don't have any more gross words to describe my content I'll see you in the next video

so do you run ads but you're a degenerate lazy piece of you don't want to put any effort into it you want your ads to just convert despite you using the same ad images the same text and copy heck you can just throw it in AI pop it out just throw that diarrhea all over Facebook and you use the world's ugliest landing pages and you still convert at crazy amounts does that sound good to you of course it does because you know why you're a degenerate piece of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] but I like you like putting absolutely no effort into my ad so what I'm going to show you in this video is actually something that allowed me to put almost no effort into my ads and take my business from zero to over $30 million per while keeping my ad cost very low that is on about $3,000 A Day In AD spend the returns I get on my ads are absolutely alarming they make everybody else's ad spend look small beta and very non- Giga Chad and I'm going to give this technique to you and then you can just use it forever and and forget everything you know about sales copywriting landing pages and just do this cuz it works so much better it makes your ads convert so so so much higher in fact when I've given this to people with with their ads even if they're semi beginners it's allowed them to just stop doing everything else just focus on this and their business grows and their ads are instantly almost guaranteed profitable because this is just that damn effective and this is what I like to call the testimonial letter now like other videos I like to try and keep these short if you want to see the ad targeting for this the way I actually make money and monetize this there'll be links to those at the end of this video also in the description you should check those out cuz that's the entire part of the system and as a added benefit I have no course to sell you because I've actually made a ton of money already doing this I'm just Sly adding you to a remarketing list for hyos right now so I just give away everything on this channel so you can grow your ads and then when you're like hey I'd like to make more money for my ad I'll just add hyros in and then you'll make 15 20% more like that which will be proven to you in this video as well but hyos isn't required for this in fact being an intelligent individual not required for this at all you can be a baboon level ad Runner and you'll beat everybody and it's using what I like to call the testimonial ladder using this simple pattern allowed us to take hyros from 0 to $30 million per year it allow to take info businesses from0 to $10 million per year I've seen this work and actually just works everywhere because it's the base of how to get people to do what you want so what exactly is this let me explain the testimonial louder process is simply a process of getting testimonials from people and then using those testimonials get larger testimonies for more repal people and then advertising it and then repeating that process over and over again till the world ends now this sounds really simple it's advertise your testamental yeah but you have to understand how to do this in a specific way and if you do this in a spef specific way your business will start from absolute scratch to working its way up to getting the largest testimonials in the industry from the biggest names and then once you have that you really don't need much else you can mess up everything else but if you have the biggest names in an industry saying hey this works and then hundreds of testamental is also saying this works you don't need to do anything else let me explain so how does this work it essentially involves getting early testimonials for your product and then using that to stack other testimonials let me explain so very early on my career when I was a stage 10 scumbag I would be launching procs on the warrior Forum now you have to be about 60 years old to uh remember what the warrior form is this is back when you actually had to learn how to do internet marketing on your own it was the Wild Wild West cowboy days of it and uh so what I would do is I go in these forums and everybody had these really long form copy Pages they have all this stuff convincing you to buy their little scammy scuzzy project and I was like hm I I think the better way to do this would actually be to a make a product at works first this is one of the first requirements is but two what I would instead do instead of making these long copies and trying to persuade people to do it I would just go and get testimonies from 20 30 people I would give them the product the product would work they'd leave a testimoni and I just make pages with hundreds and hundreds of testimonal on and then people would buy that was that was literally the only copy on the page it' be a little Snippets headlines and typical stuff then hundreds of testimonials and so what I started doing for all of my businesses is I would go and launch the business I get testimonials and I would advertise those testimonials and I would stack the testones up to a large obnoxious amount and then just advertise that and this allowed me to absolutely crush it in info marketing making tens of millions of dollars per year but when this really took off is when I started sniper focusing this to get larger testimonals and larger testimonals and piggyback it and then use that to take over an entire industry so let me explain to you how I did this in info marketing and hyos and you can kind of see how to do this in your industry so when I launched hyos for example a the product works if you put hyos onto your ads with a combination of print tracking and a optimization you simply make 15 to 20% more from your ads this is proven this is factual we have a 90-day guarantee on it that if a person comes on and their ads do not scale they don't make more money from it they don't pay for it because it just simply works so that's the first Barone thing you got to do the next thing you want to do is when you launch your product you need to find your first Core 10 power customers these are people that really want to use your product and you just give it to them for free now if nobody wants to use your product even though you give it away for free you probably don't have the right product Market fit and I'll talk about that in an entire other video Let's imagine you have a lot of people that actually want to use your product and they get results from it you get these 10 people on board and then you get them to leave 10 testimonials okay specifically you want to get these people in the same industry so if I'm doing info marketing or marketing my product at hyos to agencies that run ads for info businesses what I did is I went and got 10 info agencies and I let them use it for free and I should I showed them hey you plug this into your ads it makes more money they plugged into their ads they made more money so then what I use that for is to then run ads to pages that had all their testimonials on this and I use this to start getting more agencies and businesses similar to them in the info space in but here's where it gets very very interesting once you have this amount of testimonials what this allows you to do if your product is unique in a market space for example if you have a product that everybody else has you're going to have a hard time getting really big well-known people to use it but if you have a product that is unique you can basically reach out to businesses large well-known businesses and offer it to them for free free get them results and then simply ask for a testimonial so what we did at our business is I took these testimonials we initially had to start getting my initial customers from ads that's that's literally all I did I got 10 testimonials and I ran a simple sales page with a video and these 10 testimonials and book a call but where this really turned in the fire is when I took these 10 testimonials and I reached out to specific agencies so for example I reached out to Tony Robins Ad Agency I reached out to clickfunnels I reached out to Big names like Sam ovens in our Grant card in fact if you just go look at hris we have testimonals from basically everyone in the infom marketing space why because what I did is I reached out to these businesses starting from maybe a smaller tier so I'd find a really big well-known person in the infom marketing space let's say Dan Henry okay Dan is a little bit more private back in the day but this person was pretty big in the industry okay so then what I do is I get results for Dan Henry for example and then I use that to reach out to someone who was at a little bit higher level and say hey we just got him results right here do you want to try this out out I can pretty much guarantee it work you come on for free if it does work for you you just leave a testimonial and so we use this to go higher and higher up to the point where we were working with the biggest names in the industry and then we'd use one testimonial from a big name in Industry to lure around another person so for example we got Grant Cardone results with hyros you got his ad team results with hyros and then we reached out to Tony Robbins ad team and we slowly started getting all these big names on hyros simply by doing that and then collecting a testimonial then what do you think I did once I had those testimonials all we did is we started running ads to our website focusing on these testimonials so for example check out this page right here okay you can see it's just an obnoxious level of results across the entire industy now hus does so much more outside of info now so we have testimon from everybody SAS companies like click phonos Playboy and e-commerce influencers and e-commerce I don't want you to focus on that right now because this applies to the same thing if I'm doing it in e-commerce I'm doing it in SAS right now I'm going to repeat this process in any business that I'm doing but then what I would do is I'd run ads with these testimonials and then send people to Pages like this it is just an endless page of results that our business has gotten because the only thing that people really care about and the only thing that people really believe is results and convincing results from people that they know in an industry you don't just want to grab random testimonials you want to grab targeted testimonials from Big names and well-known people and then you show them the endless congol line of results you've gotten for more normal or less well-known businesses and you just keep it coming you keep stacking you keep stacking and keep stacking it then you start to pitch and you can see at the bottom of this page we just have a simple booking form that's it this page has almost no copywriting on it it is just endless results I've ran this page in a format on clickfunnels that's very very very ugly much worse looking than this and it actually worked better than this good-looking page now of course we want to have other parts of our site we want to you know have other features and things that are going on in our business but this is really what it takes and then once you have the big names in your industry well here's how you expand the business even more you use those big names in your industry to springboard in other Industries so for example we're working like with a big brand like Playboy we go and show them all the testimonies we got from Big names and infom marketing say hey this will work in e-commerce for you use it repeat the process then use that to get more testimonials in e-commerce what about SAS same thing we're doing right now at hus right now for SAS working with clickfunnels got click funnel results show other SAS companies start building a Rolodex of SAS companies same thing with a agencies find big well-known agencies in their agency space repeat that process and you use this process to keep expanding the business endlessly because again all we're doing is we're getting testimonials we're using those testimonials to get bigger testimonials then we advertise the bigger testimonials with all the smaller testimonials underneath them and this can be essentially all your ads boil down to this is such a simple stupid concept that allows you to run ugly landing pages basic advertising and get Superior results to pretty much everyone else in your industry you can stop focusing on making really high all the ads and having the world's best meta Tik Tok YouTube targeting advertising management you can just focus on this and then the final snippet to why this really works really well is eventually everyone in your industry or in the niche you're targeting just starts to see these testimonials all the all over the place all the time and they're going to think of your business whenever they do actually want to become a customer now with this if you want to see how to actually run the ads the scripts for this I have my YouTube ad script my exact ad scripts right here I have how I monetize it right here and I have the type of products I like like to sell best with this type of funnel right here this is all the information you need I have nothing else to say to you go browse around the channel learn some more young Padawan I'll see you in the next video

TITLE: The #1 Reason Your Facebook Ads Fail

================================================================================

so before you run any ads especially if you're a beginner but this super duper applies you if you're Advanced and you actually do something that takes investment you have to do this this is going to guarantee that when you actually start to spend money on ads it will work it will give you a basically green light to actually start running ads for your business and know that they will work and you can scale them to the Moon without you investing any money effort or time and the reason you want to know this is because 90% of people not just beginners but Advanced people all the way to me if you don't do this you are going to launch ads you're going to make a new product you're going to launch a new business this is where it gets really nasty if you're just launching businesses without doing this you're going to lose so much money and then you put it up on advertising and then it doesn't work for example I made a supplement company back in a day I made a whole webinar from it from it I invested into the products the manufacturing the whole shebang and then I launched ads and it didn't sell well at all it it it was like selling old teeth and if you don't know I don't know if you ever tried to sell old teeth via ads it doesn't work I don't know why the Market's not there maybe it's just I'm before my time in 2025 selling old people's teeth going to be crispy but for real you just need to do this one thing and this will fix all of it it is called baking muffins so what does this mean and how does this apply to your business so baking muffins means making as little as you can to test whether a business or product idea works so like all these videos I try to keep these short so if you want to see the actual YouTube ad scripts I use for this how I test the ads for this on Facebook the funnels I like to use these will all be linked at the end of this video and unlike other channels I don't have some course to tell you because I've already made a comical amount of money actually doing this so you can just sit back relax and take your skeptical glasses off so what does this involve well let me just give you a situation how I could have determined whether that e-commerce business that I made would have worked or not so I made all these supplements these biohacking supplements and whatnot I made a big old webinar for them all the manufacturing everything you know what I could have done instead of investing all that money time and effort I could have just made the sales page and then the first graphics for the ads and website and then just made an e-commerce store and then ran ads to that e-commerce store without having a product just made the big old page and then the pitch and everything in fact I could have skipped the pitch and just made a basic e-commerce store and see if that even gets traction but I know what you're thinking but Alex what if they come to the store and buy well right before they buy I could have just not accepted their credit card and I could have counted that as a conversion wait what am I what am I saying here am I saying run traffic to websites that don't actually have a product on them run traffic to pages that sell products that don't actually exist and don't collect money yes that's exactly what I'm saying here why let me explain so look the most damaging thing you can ever do in business is spend a month making a product making all this stuff without confirming that the market actually wants it or most importantly that it will sell from ads see a few videos ago I talked about how to build your business around what the market wants in terms of advertising how easy is it to advertise your customer how unique is your product to get it to your customer and how easily will you be able to run ads at a high profit margin because you are targeting or running ads in a way that is highly profitable you design the business for ads but before we even go and design a business we don't want to spend months and tens of thousand of dollars or hundreds of thousand of dollars or 500s of dollars I don't know what range of business you're in making a product and all these things and then it goes to ads and it doesn't work what is so much easier to do is you make the pitch or the product offering without ever doing anything else so for example let's imagine I went and just made an e-commerce website selling a protein powder let's say I have an idea or a spin for protein powder and I want to see if it works what I can do is I can make a simple onepage or mostly empty website we don't want to put a ton of time into this maybe we have a homepage and then just the product page selling it I'm assuming at this point you've been to an e-commerce webs site where they sell protein powder or something like that we put the whole pitch we put an image of the product on the page we have everything that we use to sell and then what we do is we send traffic to that page and if it doesn't convert we assume hey this product sucks people don't actually want this and what we start doing is we start then running traffic to different variations of our idea so we're let's say we have a protein powder that has vegetables thrown to it then we have a protein powder that increases your IQ and then let's say we have a protein powder that improves your skin I don't know okay and so what we do is instead of going and making a formulation or building a business around all three of those products what we're instead going to do is we're going to run traffic to the page and the person will go through the site just like any other site say we're using Shopify in this example right here we can build the entire website up until the cart checkout we can even take the person's credit card and payment information and then just refund them instantly or not take the payments at all and if you take payments while doing this you are a stage five poople head and I'm not suggesting doing that what we want to do is we want to say hey if I spend $100 on ads right here how much money will I make back and very quickly we'll see oh wait this this product is actually clicking and advertising this product is something that people are actually buying and so we start running traffic to these pages and of course we're going to lose money doing this but not as much money and time as we would have lost if we launched the entire business and it didn't work and then what we're going to quickly do is we're going to have the market tell us what variation variation one variation 2 variation three or even confirm entire business model all together they're going to tell us what they're looking for and then then what we're going to do is we're going to go and start actually building the product and making the advertising for this see what a lot of people do is they make the entire product business advertising funnels everything before even testing if the market wants it that is like baking an entire wedding cake without tasting what it tastes like it's like baking an entire wedding cake without checking if people actually want it instead what do people do when they're baking wedding cakes for weddings they make dozens and dozens of little cupcakes and then they give this to the person who's having the wedding and they say which cupcake do you like the most and they go this cupcake and then they make the entire wedding cake this is what we are doing with ads so for example what could I have done better when I was launching my SAS companies like hyos and my original autoresponders and other SAS companies well a lot of times I'd launch a SAS company and the product would fall flat and I'd be like oh this doesn't work for mads I wish I just hadn't invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to see if this works or not what I could have instead done is made maybe just a sales page for the software and then a call booking page and then had when it start getting calls start actually doing the calls and then at the end of the call say hey by the way this product isn't here yet but you can get on the wait list and I can contact you when it's here this would have saved me bazillions of dollars in time because I can get this entire process right here done in about two days and see what SAS prodct will actually get me calls or customers coming in same can be done in e-commerce same can be done with virtually anything I could have made a mock software or a video of a software that doesn't exist I could have just had the UI put together and then a video running the product but it's really just a scripted video of me running something that looks like the product but it's not actually here and then see how people respond to that run ads to that you can even also use this when Gathering feedback and initial feedback on your product as well always always do this because again what we want to do is we want to build businesses based around what will work in advertising what's going to work easily advertising so that we can scale it really far and if we want to see what's going to do that without going investing tons of time and tons of money we can go and make little muffins or empty businesses that don't actually sell anything but look like they sell something and then see how the market responds to that first when we see a powerful response then we take everything down we take the magic lightning that we just discovered then we bottle that up then we make the product and then we go berserk with the ads and that's how you're going to almost guarantee it your ads will work day one so that being said if you actually want to see how to run the ads I have my entire ad script everything I do in video ads right here you want to see how to actually grow this business and actually find the best advertising for it once you kick it off once you take it from the fake empty product to a real product this is right here and you want to see in my opinion the best ad funnel or the best way to sell a product well that that's oh my gosh just confusing where I point at it's somewhere on this video popped up on the screen right here I have nothing else to tell you I'll see you in the next video

================================================================================

so the Mind shet shift I'm going to give you in this video when it comes to your ads and your business is going to be the biggest breakthrough you've ever had I actually guarantee it you can come to my house leave a burning bag of gorilla poop at my doorstep we're not going to offer that this if this doesn't work for you please do not put poop on my doorstep but this took my business from zero to over $30 million per year primarily fueled by ads and before that I could never really break $10 million $12 million a year from the businesses and it's because I was running my ads in my business the wrong way and if you look at my business went from $0 to $30 million per year that creates by the way a $150 $200 million valuation business if you can do that and you can structure in the right business industry which I'll talk about in other videos you're set you're good if you've ever wanted to get inanely rich this is how you do it and it comes from this pivot of how you view ads and if you look at my ads and the things I'm doing I'm not doing anything else that other people are not doing if you look at my funnel for hyros for example it is a funnel to a sales page to a call Demo almost everybody watching this Channel online knows how these funnels works you see them you're going to get blasted with ads by people when you watch this video saying Hey I got this magic system to make money and they're going to send you to a funnel that's very similar to mine but mine makes way more money than all of them combined why how can I do this it's because of this little shift right here now I try to keep these videos short which is why at the end of this video I've linked to a video showing off the specific funnel that I'm using that I'm sending traffic into so you can get the base of that I'll even show you how I write the ads and the scripts behind them so you have that covered too as well as a video covering the entire monetization process that I use for this so everything that you might want to ask is at the end of this video link to other videos on this channel and like other channels that make all their money selling your courses I have nothing to sell you in these videos I've already made tons of money actually doing this the only thing I'm doing in these videos is adding you to a giant retarding list so it can convince you to use our software in the future but the content information I'm giving you my best stuff nothing held back because I don't make money selling information I make money by you doing better with your business and your ads and then upgrading and using our tools which make them even better so please drop your skepticism to zero it's not helping you here so what is this tweak I want you to listen very closely because this will change everything like I've stated you need to build businesses build your business around where you can advertise and what the market wants I know that sounds super basic but you need to understand what most people do they build a business first and then they try to advertise it instead you want to build the business around where you can advertise it and what advertising and demand in the market is easy to advertse high too so let's look at this very quickly because again this sounds like such a simple idea make what the market wants and make where it's easy to advertise it is but no one does this because the subtlety of the idea is completely missed upon them I want to lay out to you my mistakes to then outline how you're probably making these mistakes too if you're making a business that's below $20 million per year you're making this mistake okay unless you just like making less money but by all means ignore me but look let's look at two of my businesses I had a business selling information uh courses and I had a business selling email remarketing okay so let's look at both of these businesses for what they are so if we look in the info marketing space very hard to advertise because there's tons and tons of products very similar to it thus my marketing of it is just going to be a pain in the butt two the product is very hard to sell via ads I know people sell all these all the time they make tons of money doing it but when you actually look at it it's so damn hard to sell because you're selling thin air and there's a thousand other products in the market and then three it's extremely hard to sell because where can you really Place ads for this product on only on on videos online where people are trying to make money online and so that grossly limits where I can Market this to and who I can Market this too who's going to be buying these info products too if I really want to Market these few ads people without money because people that have money and have successful businesses are not going to be buying info products so much and then if I want to Market these to people that do have successful businesses it's just an entirely hard thing to pitch because the people that are actually successful sitting around watching YouTube they're hard to reach thus you you went into so many problems with this this is why you have to sell High ticket to make this work you have very limited places of where you can place your ads at the Market's overly competitive before I even turn on my first ad it's just incredibly hard to sell this product due to all these limitations right here no matter how good my marketing is no matter how good my ads are no matter how good my copywriting and sales pages and landing pages and how famous I make myself it's going to be pushing a boulder up Mount Everest to get this going we want when we start our ads and we start our business we wanted to be like pushing a boulder down down Mount Everest so everything around this product was just hard to sell now if we go look at for example I had a business Market hero which was an email autoresponder and again we're running into the same issues right here the entire Market is very low ticket okay so if you go look at like convert kit for example they're charging like $9 a month and so let's look at the situation here I'm trying to advertise the businesses which are the most expensive people to advertise to with a low ticket product in a market that's fiercely competitive there's thousands of other autoresponders out there this is this is advertising hell because I can't sell something High ticket to make money in my ads back I'm marketing to the most expensive people there are the marketing places I can place it at are very hard to reach and the best way to make money back on ads is to be able to go a little bit High ticket especially when you're doing B2B marketing you can't do this here so a lot of people go and they make businesses without thinking about the fight that they're getting in and they think they're going to out add it they think they're going to outsmart the ads and make the best advertising on planet Earth and that's going to be their key and so you have people spend years on their business working on the ads working on the ads working on what they're saying working on the sales Pages thinking that's where their goal and ticket is going to come from and it just simply is not so for example when I made hyos we were able to get this to $10 million a year very quickly and I've never broken more than a couple thousand A Day In AD spin at hyros but on these other businesses I was breaking 10 $20,000 a day sometimes because the businesses were set up for high effort low return and ads whereas hyos for example let's look at this what were all the fundamentals that went in the hyos working okay one low competition there is very few products in the market that can do what hyos did back then even now there's very few products in the market and they don't really advertise very well if I'm getting into the infom marketing space every [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in that space is an advertising m Master every sales video every ad is built to the te to convert cuz these people cannot make money without being at the top of their game right here no okay so first thing we want to look at is low competitivity in the advertising space which is a lot of businesses as soon as you break out of info marketing or education or coaching or Consulting there's very little competition and advertising so we want to look at our product and say all right are the competitors advertising well no I can stand out now another thing that hus does not have but you should look for is how easy is it to advertise so for example I want to give you an example of what worked really well in e-commerce and supplements if you look at gfuel and all the um the gaming pre-workouts SL caffeine drinks if you noticed before those businesses took out no one was advertising to Gamers no one was advertising these energy drinks to Gamers and using influencers to do it and so if you look at this there's an entire part of the market Gamers not being marketed to that were accessible through influencers and noral advertising and then all they had to do is connect this product to this market and the advertising for this was extremely profit because no one else was doing it and so they're able to go and grab up this entire share of the ad Market that was completely wide open that's why the business was successful if you opened a pre-workout or energy supplement and you target the normal markets using the normal means you wouldn't have done well how many products like no explode were released in this time frame where instead what they did is they built the business around the market the advertising Market instead of building the business around what they wanted and then trying to Market it through the same venues this is the big shift now we also want to look at the Dynamics of the product I knew when I was making a software company having a low ticket software company wasn't going to work like a MailChimp or something why because it's so damn hard to make your money back on ads when you're selling low tickets you have to convert so highly whereas with hyos I said okay cool we can make this High ticket all right I can charge $ 35 dner dollars up front and so I want to make something like segment I want to make something like Heroku I want to something like Salesforce where it's very expensive upfront or can charge very expensive prices to high ticket customers and then I want to make sure the customer base was good who buys ad software people running ads who runs ads people that make money no one no one that doesn't have money isn't running ads if a person is broke they're not going to be running ads and so I'm marketing exclusively to people with money so let's look at all the things that were different with hyro so far competition in the ad space low ability to sell High ticket yes who am I selling to rich people and then combine the other traits of the business which I talked about the end of this video which is the LTV and the rebills and when I got into this I knew primarily how I was going to advertise this I knew exactly which vehicles would work really really well for this which were retargeting YouTube videos based around ads and so there's a lot of other things that go into this as far as the product goes but you need to start going and thinking about how to design your business around the traits that work well with ads and then the ad Market itself the ad market for pre-workouts extremely competitive impossible to reach the ad market for gamers wide open so what you do is instead of going and building a business that you want to build you say all right cool how can we tweak this business to take advantage of the markets that are wide open how can I build my offer and my product I'm selling to have the best traits that work with an ad how can I find the low competition markets and then design the product to work really well with it and by the way low competition markets with a high ticket product that is reoccurring and is being sold to rich people this is this this is what works goes nuts and this is why hyos my ad tracking business did infinitely better than my email responding business though the advertising behind the email autoresponder business was top tier Ninja level I had to like bend over backwards and jump through hoops full of fire and train a tiger just to get a sale there not the same at at at hyros and this little pivot right here is the difference between me having a software business it was doing you know $3 $4 million a year and a software business doing over $30 million a year this is the difference between having a Pre-K Workout Company uh that does no money and a pre-workout company just goes to the moon in the easiest advertising possible because no one's marketing to them this is how you have to structure your business and this is what will make your ads work and not work now at the end of this video like I pointed out right here here is a video on the funnels that I'm using the scripts that I'm using in the ads and even the long-term monetization strategy I haven't I don't know where these videos going to pop up but they're here they're on here somewhere so watch them you'll make more money okay bye

================================================================================

everyone and I mean everyone who makes a lot of money from their business I'm talking a n figure1 million plus businesses which I can tell you about cuz I built them does this why do they do this because it makes ads [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money and you don't even have to be good at it you can actually be quite bad as soon as I made this shift in my business I went for having a business did a couple seven figures a year to having combined amount of businesses that do $30 $40 million per year businesses that have $100 million valuations businesses that have busted $100,000 a day in ads I'm rich I don't see that the brag okay I kind of do I just want to let you know this is what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] works and I have no course or anything to sell you because I've already made enough money doing this I just want to add you to my retargeting list so I can Target you for my software company that's really what I'm doing here but you're going to learn a lot in the process now this tag teams on the last video that I showed you guys where I showed you the process of using High ticket sales to essentially get customers from ads for free if you didn't watch that video there's a link to it at the end of this video there's also a link in the description you should watch that video as soon as you're done with this because that's the key to getting everything into what I'm about to show you for free that's how you get tons of customers in your business ready to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slapped with value okay don't don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slap your customers I'm sorry I just have to sit up here and use profanity and entertain myself with horrible metaphors because I've been making business content for way too long if I don't scream poop jokes and say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a few times this is just dreadfully boring for me so please let me Spruce it up so I don't commit sioku from talking about business for the Thousand time but if you do this your ads are simply going to work they are going to print money it's almost impossible not to do this and you can finally stop making social media and YouTube videos that get customers you can actually Chuck up walk up to the table and buy customers like a man it feels great not to have to go on Tik Tok every day and shake your butt around make faces and dance around like some skibbidy Rizzy genzer you know you you're probably like 20 30 years old it's time to stop it it's time to actually learn how to run traffic like a grown adult this is how you do it so look last video I showed you how to get high ticket sales and essentially send people in to your business at no cost for example in that video let's say we bought 500 leads for $5 a lead I showed you how to essentially break even on that or even make money just by selling a high ticket this allows us to get 500 customers in for free that's the Golden Goose right there now what we need to do once we get the customers in the business for free is we gain a few things when we get a customer into the business specifically if you gather their email using that opin page again I'll link to that video at the end of this video as well it all Ties on that so you have to know what I'm talking about a little bit just watch those videos but what we did before we did the high ticket Clos is we sent people to an optin this gets us a few things this gets us their email when they go to the high ticket content video that happens after this get gets us rapport with them and they're also on a retargeting list so what do we have here we have the contact information and an easy way to contact them cheaply via ads and they like us if we made a good content video after they opted in this is a person just Prime to be sold to for years if you handle it correctly so let's imagine we get these 500 people on the email list now I can give you a follow-up strategy exactly what to say on the email list and be a retargeting ads we'll get to that later on the channel you just need to start looking at it this way imagine if if we get these 500 people to on average spend $5 a month with us over a year and this is totally possible to do with email list by the way $5 per lead isn't that hard especially if you're in the right Niche hell let's just say $2 let's keep it simple let's be idiots about this let's let's imagine you're underperformer you're just a 6 IQ Point dude trying to make your way in the world so that's $1,000 in sales times 12 off of $2,500 in ad spend while being terrible at this this is where people mess up everything I laid out here you're thinking this this Zone's too simple just mark it to them after yes you cover your cost with a high ticket product if you're a person it must cover your cost I don't even focus on that CU I don't care obviously you can see you make so much more money down here why even focus on this part but most of you who are starting a business and don't want to lose money up front and need to make money right away this is the best strategy to use so watch that video at the end of this video but what we then do is we hit them up on our email list list with procs affiliate offers if you're an absolute degenerate just build your own business you don't need to run affiliate offers but if you must other high ticket offers while also sending these people via emailing and retargeting more content that is good to keep that Rapport going and as long as you keep the Rapport going you can easily remarket them cheaply so for example if you have 5,000 people you can retarget them on Facebook for like three bucks a day effectively at huge profitability you can email them for free you keep that Rapport going it's not too hard to get 10 people out of this 500 to spend a 100 bucks with you each month thus getting to that goal of $2 per lead because they already trust you they already like you they're on the list because they're interested in what you're talking about so you just do that now there's all sorts of advanced things you can do with e-commerce businesses or software but what 90% of people don't do is this get the lead pay for the lead upfront using the high ticket tactic then measure how much the lead spends with you on average over year getting the $1 to $2 is easy then you're going to see that every $5 lead you get spends $24 with you so you're just trading $5 bills for $24 on autopilot I do this in a much more complicated way with SAS businesses where I'll pay like $2,000 for $400 a subscription and you're probably like how's he do that it's because I track how the subscription stay they say on average for two years so I make $8,000 from $2,000 you combine that over a lot of AD spend you print money this is the shift you need to make if you want to see how to get the leads into your business essentially for free watch this video if you want to see the actual funnel the landing pages being used to accomplish this to give you some ideas watch this video if you want to not die alone and you want your children to think you're a very impressive man you can run ads in a business very functionally subscribe to this channel I don't have anything else to say to you

TITLE: A FILTHY Ad Script Making Me $102,000 A Day
VIDEO ID: ZnsJUJoXr1Q

================================================================================

so we going to play my microphone like a banjo for now to start these videos you ever look at your ads and think to yourself why are these things not scaling why are they not converting higher why do I always get to a certain point and I spend more money and then it doesn't convert or maybe it doesn't convert at all you ever wonder why that's happening it's probably because your ads suck no I'm I'm just joking I'm just joking it's a problem with the Internet it's not a problem with your ads but here's why they're not converting okay all right it's because of two simple things you are not getting people's attention in you're not convincing them with enough mph with enough power with enough prowess that clicking on your ad is going to benefit them they don't believe you they're not paying attention to you if you just fix these two things you are going to make so much more money from your ads and I can tell you this because what I'm going to showing this video I use a scale one ad campaign past $100,000 per day just $100,000 cash of about probably about 25 to $30,000 A Day In AD spin I've also used this to grow a SAS business past $100 million valuation so it's worked pretty well for me now of course if if you're making $500,000 a day a billion dollars SAS valuation don't listen to me at all cuz you are a Wise Wise silverback gorilla on hill but if you're below that you should listen you should apply this to your ads because this is going to fix 90% of your ads anytime my ads are not working correctly I just come back and do this this works on YouTube this works on Facebook this works on Tik Tok because it is the basis of human convincing and communication so apply this let me show you so look you can use this literally everywhere Tik Tok Facebook ads YouTube ads it does not matter if you are trying to talk to someone way where the goal is to get them to click something and go somewhere and hear more about it this is how you communicate with them period now look this is a two-part video this video right here I'm going to introduce you to the communication style and the concept you can just use this framework everywhere but you're probably not going to want to think for yourself because who wants to do that okay and so I've made these videos bite chunked because I'm fully aware and empathetic that you have Tik Tok brain you can't focus on one video for more than 10 minute at a time so you can watch this video and then you can come back a year later uh after committing to improving your business and catch the second video this second video that I'm going to link to at the end of this video has an entire breakdown of this script being applied in YouTube ads so you can go and see an ad that I created from it you can see the script walk through it's all on YouTube it's all for free I'm not trying to sell you anything I just want your juicy juicy attention and viewership so I'm just going to give you stuff that's made me tons of money to bribe you for that so look let's get down to this you have about 45 seconds in an ad let me make sure see I'm already off the screen this I really got to work at this this content creation I'm kind of new to it so bear with me look when you're communicating with anybody and you want to get to them to do something on internet you have about 45 seconds but you don't even have 45 seconds you have chunks to get them to the 45 seconds and 45 seconds is the optimum amount of time to get them to then do the thing you want them to do but you need to persuade them enough in this 45 seconds to get them to do do it 45 seconds you try and do it in 5 seconds they don't do it you try and do it in a minute and a half they've already lost attention this is the magic sweet spot and it's broken down into sub sectors so we have the first 10 seconds and we even have the first 5 seconds in that then we have the next 20 seconds and then we have the final 20 seconds with the final 5 Seconds that is the CTA okay so what do we do here the first 5 Seconds of any communication is hooking the person what does this mean it means getting their attention and creating interest in relation to something they want that ties into your business so for example when you watch the beginning of this video what's the first thing I talked about and laid out there immediately that this is going to improve the results of your ads across your business but I also did it in a funny weird way by talking all sorts of hoopla and passive aggressively talking [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to you you're like whoa what's going on this guy's a dick and he's promising me result what's happening one that's just how I talk in videos but two I'm predispositioned to speak in this this form of communication because I've been doing ads for so long I I no longer function as a normal human being I just completely communicate in copywriting form but we have to go out there and think about what pain or what goal can we trigger in the person it's usually pain that's the best way to roll with it and then how can we put in an attention grabbing way so if you look at any of my ads out there even the low effort ones I'll put like an Iron Man and thumb drive or I'll be wearing a Pikachu onz and what I will then do is make a big bold promise so we want to do something that gets their attention Okay and we might want to make a big bold promise backed up usually with some interesting stat a very detailed and precise stat because the more precise you are the more interesting it is so for example if I just start an ad and said hey do you want to improve your ad results you're like sure but if I'm like hey in a Pikachu onesie wearing a Wizardry hat a Harry Potter hat or let's even make it even weirder let's say I hold a gold fris in front of you and say this is proven across 153 businesses to increase ad results by 15.3% you're like whoa wait what's this goldfish doing and then I have you with this interesting Stat or this big bold promise and so this hooks the person we want to make a big bold promise right here now the next 10 seconds are backing up that promise with undeniable proof and results so what you want to do in your business is you want to get your customers results I know that's a far-fetched thing that people don't really like to do anymore but you should really get them results and then you should get testimonials you should film them in the wild using your product and going like oh wow this is an absolute ass so assuming you can do that one basic step I'm going to assume you can okay if you're watching this video right now and you're like I'm like you got to collect results from your customers you're like but I don't have any of those so what do I do I'm like I I can't help you okay but if you're one of those people that's not running an MLM or pony scheme online you're good so what we need to do is collect results from our customers specifically I'll give you a few techniques that work really well for me is get your product in the hands of influencers and bigger names for free get them to use it and get them to leave testimonials and result and return for whatever just get it done that works really well as well so for example at hyos my ad attribution company um we have an agency that runs Tony Robbins ads you know Playboys ads we have Jay shett on there Patrick B David uses it or for example in like SAS we we get large businesses like clickfunnels or up incoming businesses like runpod businesses that matter to the Target customer okay so for example if I'm trying to Target infom marketers I want to use testimonials from like Grant Cardone or something if I want to Target SAS marketers I want to use testimonials from like clickfunnels or large SAS businesses on our platform and we have all those Tes OS because frankly when people plug their ads in the hos they make 15 20% more guaranteed you should use it but whatever this is that's not for you cuz you don't like making more money the bigger point is get testimonials no matter what and get testimonials from people that are going to be similar to the customer you're trying to acquire now make those testimonials Focus around your big promise so for example if I talk about in an ad how hrus is going to increase people's ad scill I get a bunch of AD scale testimonials and I show those and I back them up and what I'll do a lot of times in videos is make a giant page of testimonials and scroll past them in a really obnoxious way I've been doing this for almost 15 years when I used to launch procs on Warrior Forum uh way back back in the day I would find hundreds and hundreds of testimonials that's just the one thing I would do when I made a product and then I would just paste them all on a page so it took a person like 10 minutes to scroll past all of them it's extremely effective tactic so I back up the big buold promise so what I've done is I've gotten the person's attention and I've triggered some pain or reminded them of some pain or made some big promise of of a benefit or a result and I've backed it up and then what I do is I explain how that is accomplished without explaining it at all so for example what you want to do is you want to make the person watching the ad feel that they are missing out and not doing something and so what you want to explain is you want to explain that thing they're not doing but not in a way they can understand per se so for example at hyos I'll point out how ad platform tracking is just wildly inaccurate and if you're using that you're using the wrong data and if you're using the wrong data you're going to lose a ton of money and then that trains your AI completely wrong on ad platforms thus you make less money and hos fix that by using a new form of print tracking a optimization now what does that mean if we really boil it down did I explain how it does anything no not really that is what it does but that just creates interest and makes you feel like you're not using this and you're just losing tons of money so I got your attention I proved that everything I'm saying works and then I made you feel like you're doing something that is causing you all sorts of pain and not getting you the result you want and you don't understand it so now you feel like you're missed out you're like a person on the outside of a club uh not being let in what a lot of people do at these points in their videos is they try and explain their product and how it works we don't want to do that we want to get the click and so this next 25 seconds we're really going to be focusing on the click and we're going to break this down in two points right here so I just show them all these results and I explain how it works right here now they're thinking how do I do this too okay so what I want you to do is I want you to click this add and we can plug that exact thing into your business without any effort today and get you the same results as all the results I showed you before now what we like to do with hrus is I like to add on to that that hey if it doesn't get you that result you don't pay for it so this makes the person go this guy is insane he must this must actually work or this guy's running the dumbest ad campaign in history you don't have to throw that in I know not everybody can guarantee that but having some form of a crazy guarantee is um usually helpful in ads also in your business if you're if you're are selling a product that doesn't get results and the way you're keeping and making money is keeping people who don't get results as money eventually the business dies so having a crazy refund guarantee is just in your favor yeah you're going to get more refunds at first but you're going to solve and plug the problems in your business and keeping people's money who don't want you to have it makes them mad and then you ruin your business's reputation but who cares about that let's just print money by putting hoopla on Google ads but this is what we want to do in the final SEC 20 seconds okay look if you want to get that result I just talked about if you want to fix this pain click this ad go here do this thing we will get you this result with very little effort just you want to make it as little effort as possible you're going to get this result if you just click this ad we actually guarantee it now this is a really forthcoming ad if you are running for example you're going to see in the next video linked after this me running this like webinars for info products the goal there is to get them to join uh the webinar the free event okay so this in in my hus ads we're going for the call in other ads I'm going to show you we're going for a webinar sale there's other ads I'm going to show you where we're going for like an e-commerce sale so you really want to then the pitch around that and in the final 5 Seconds what you want to do in the ads is give them time to click so reemphasize click hey go here click now this ad will end here in a second go here click now a lot of times I'll just do a black screen with a button on it why because what people do is a lot of people wait till the end of the ad and then it will just end and it will move on to the video and they're like oh I'm not going back to find that ad so that's just a little handy thing you can do right there off the end of it and so this is what you need to do to convince people to do things in an ad it usually takes about 45 seconds if we're going into a minute 30 which sometimes I will do an ads but all the the core message the core thing I'm getting done is always done in this first 45 seconds and then I'll use an extra minute 30 to do extra stuff that you will see in the the videos after this I'll link to Again on YouTube there's no optin or pitch I'm trying to get you into but we need to accomplish this in the first 45 seconds and 90% of our hoopla is going to get done in this first 45 seconds and if you look at my sales videos it's really just this but long longer which is what happens on the page they go to so that's the lesson for the day this right here is what this is how you should make almost every ad it just works there's other things you can do like testimonial mashups and images but if you're making video ads to cold customers this is what really has gotten it done for me in every format for almost a decade you should use it now what should you do you should subscribe to this channel because I'm going to make more videos like this and I know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm talking about unlike everybody else on YouTube and I'm not selling you things this is a great place for you to hang out on top of that after this video I said it's a two-part video you want to see the script you want to see this actually being applied in action right watch the video that's going to show up after this video it's going to be a big black screen it's going to be a video on there with the video you click it it will show you all this in action you can apply it and it will get you better results with your ads so I'll see you the next video

hyrulian have you ever had an ad running it's doing great making tons of money your parents are even proud of you and then it just dies and your parents won't talk to you anymore hopefully all that has happened to you except the parents part because if you were in ads you've had eyes die on you just what happens when you run out so in this video i'm going to show you exactly how to fix your ads there's actually a series of questions and metrics you can look at if you focus on these in this order you'll get your ads fixed that's it i have nothing more to add to it except if you want to win and get three thousand dollars in ad courses every week in our community post area i post links to these courses and if you see this post you can click the link and you'll get access to courses for free you won't see the link unless you're subscribed to this channel so subscribe to this channel so you'll see the link because i take it down after 24 hours now let's get to the content let's go we're here to talk about okay guys so let's talk about this when your ad dies i see people get super duper confused they're like why is my ad dead what did i do wrong and is it something that's happening in the ad manager and i'm going to tell you straight up no it's not it i i very rarely ever see anybody fix or revive their ad campaigns or take a campaign it's gone like this and bring it back up again because they've figured out some bidding technique in the ad manager or there was something wrong with their audience if an ad worked before and it stopped working there's a very systematic way you can go about making the ad work again if it will work again not all ads will work again and not all offers are meant to go to distance i must be incredibly straightforward with that everybody else who talks about ads and everybody else who talks about internet marketing they act like you could sell anything online there are some things people don't want to buy the market's either full the market's saturated the product sucks it's not interesting to them there's been a thousand other products and everybody that's bothered about there's a billion things and reasons why people don't want to buy something and it can happen to your product so first off one of the reasons why your ads might fail is because people aren't interested in what you're selling you you're gonna have to look at that it's happened to me it's gonna happen to anybody in any business so just be aware of it next thing you need to look at is the layers of the ad and this is how we're gonna detect which things are wrong because there's the ad itself there's initial landing page and then there's the offer okay and there's the offer itself and in some cases there's going to be the funnel between or after the offers presented so let's talk about this when you're running and checking if your ads why they stopped working you need to be able to diagnose what what exactly went wrong okay is there a ton of money being spent with lower return have sales stopped what's happening so the first thing we're going to look at is you know first off let's look at the visit to conversion rate because this is going to be the number one thing okay look at the visit the conversion rate if 100 people still visited your offer and they're converting at 10 percent you're you're probably good okay and if if if this is good if everything else has gone to hell for example we used to be able to get a hundred people to our offer for ten dollars now it cost fifty dollars and we're not seeing an roi that's where the problem is going to be at this is the most important thing to check because this means people still want to buy your offer this means people still want to get there okay and so that's the most important thing to look at just look at your vizio ratio the sales particularly for a single campaign all right what a lot of people do is they have like 50 different campaigns well guess what these are 50 different types of people all coming through you don't want to look at the overall of all these different people because maybe one campaign is sending way more people than used to other ones not it's not an accurate metric look at your number one campaign and look at the conversion rate from that campaign of the people that clicked to the amount of people that bought well how can you do that accurately well you can use hiros because if you're not tracking your your ads accurately you're working off of inaccurate data and for example if you were trying to buy stocks in the stock market off of the wrong stock prices guess what you'd make the wrong choices it's the same thing with ads please use high-risk or something to track your ads there's a link below it we literally guarantee you'll see a 20 increase in your ads literally guarantee you don't pay for it check it out but this is what you need to do if you can't track amount of people coming to your page and their conversion rate then you already have another problem all right so once you confirm that hey look people are still buying the offer let's go down and actually look at what's going on here we'll talk about if the offer is the problem and that's that's a whole other bag of weeds right there so first off the ad how do we know if the ad is the problem okay well if you look at the ad you gotta ask yourself series of questions written right here okay so look here's the number one thing you look at did the cpc increase or the cpm i usually don't like to look at these stats but it can give you a hint okay so did the cpc or cpm increase if this did there's only one reason why this happened it's because people are not interacting with your ad the way they used to that's what's happening now of course your your network that you're running the ads on could have gotten more competitive or something your cpc or cpm it's largely not going to spike up and down you might see that with the ios updates or whatnot but usually you're not going to see a hundred percent 200 increase it's you're going to see a gradual increase over time because more people enter the market and the prices go up so what do you do in this incident right here okay what you want to do is you want to look at this and then you want to look at the conversion rates typical conversion rates in your landing page for example if it cost me five dollars to get a cpl uh or an opt-in and if i still have a forty percent opt-in rate on my landing page well the reason why my ads aren't working they're not working anymore it's because the cpc and cpm went up because either people are not interacting with my ads like they used to or they the cost simply went up so what do we do in the situation do we do we what's our option we only have one option make the ads better make the ads more attention grabbing get more clicks and engage the customer more okay that's that's really your only solution right there besides in some cases when you can't get the cpc or cpm down well you're just going to have to make everything else significantly better in your funnel so you can afford a higher cpc and cpm that's going to be the case especially as you scale you need to ask yourself as well all right well my ads working or do they fall apart because i started scaling well what happened is as cpc and cpm gets more expensive because you start interacting with customers that are not as engaged as your smaller audience customers if you're averaging or you're running ads to let's say 100 a day audience that audience is going to be much more targeted than a thousand dollar a day audience so these are going to go up immensely the way you scale is you make sure you have an ad and offer a landing page and everything that can work at scale to a broader audience or at least converts much higher that's where most people fall apart this who would my own full part at scale well it's because as soon as traffic actually gets somewhat expensive for you you can't afford it anymore because your offer isn't converting high enough your pages aren't converting on enough so that being said if you look at your ad and your cpc has not gone up but something's falling apart what you next want to go to is look at your landing page look at the metrics on it okay there's a few things that could actually happen has anything changed on your landing page go through and test your funnel this is something that most people don't do there's been all sorts of times where i've looked at my funnel on a mobile phone and like oh crap the headline is the size of the entire screen like you have it's not optimizing for a mobile phone or it's redirecting or it's loading seven 15 seconds too late on the screen let's fix this okay that's the most no-brainer thing to do always check that out just do a quick rundown load up your thing on load it up on a phone have other people load up your pages uh load up it from different browsers just look at it just look at it you might see something weird usually what's gonna happen is it's probably gonna be something wrong with the mobile phone i've seen times where people can't opt in from their mobile phone but they can opt in from desktop and because you work on a desktop you don't see that next thing you want to look at is if that looks okay look at the conversion rate on the lane page let's say we have an opt-in page are people still opting in at 30 percent are people still booking calls at the same amount okay look at the base uh lead stats okay look at the base lead stats if you have a e-commerce store are people adding the cart the same amount they use too okay look at these base stats because if people aren't doing these things if for example they're not adding the cart like they used to they're not uh opting in they used to they're not booking calls like used to opposites landing page obviously the landing page if if you're most important stat right here as well that you want to look at is again you want to look at for example our opt-in to buying the offer or add the cart to buying the offer our booking to buying the offer okay if this stays the same right here then we don't really have a problem to offer we have a problem with getting the the initial first step done so you have to look at the first step and say okay what's up with the first step is the way the same it used to be okay so you got to ask yourself again what has changed in the campaign overall did we just start scaling the campaign do we start growing the campaign if so we're getting in a more broad audience that's getting us lower of these so if our cpm and cpc is looking good as we scale well then what we've got to look at is these things right here all right or add the carts down well you're gonna have to get more people to add the cart you're gonna have to improve the copy on the page you get more people who want to buy the product simple okay our opt-ins down we have to improve the opt-in page get that opt-in page higher again you're gonna have to increase that increasing an opt-in page is the number one way to increase the amount of revenue from your offer difference between 20 and 30 opt-in rate page on the actual conversions is insane because you're getting in people 10 or in this case right here 30 cheaper and you're getting in 30 more sales it's it goes both ways when you do that okay same thing with bookings what's going on okay what's going on what's going on with the bookings you want to if you get people to opt in and book a call why have they stopped booking and did you just start scaling that's always a big question you asked i just start scaling but if you're scaling and it starts to fall apart you want to look at why it's falling apart if there's if there's a specific part of your funnel that is operating the same way say for example the ads and the clicks uh cost the same okay well if these are falling apart is there something else in the funnel that's falling apart you don't have to actually kill all your scale if one part of it's working but the other parts are not so finally the most important part if these are the same and this is the same you got to look at the offer and so the way you actually really get better results from your ads overall is you got to ask yourself these questions so the best way to get results overall is you got to ask yourself these questions okay so ask yourself these things you got to ask yourself has the market change for example when i was doing my shopify e-commerce offer i was the first person on youtube doing it two years later i was not the first person doing it has the market changed yes in that situation yes it did okay are there competitors that are simply better than you or are you the only one before now there's 15 other businesses are people just simply not buying this thing anymore for example people were buying seo products a few years ago in the make money online niche then they start buying shopify products and they start buying amazon products i don't know what they're buying now but it goes in seasons people move on other things now they're buying crypto products for example market changes you got to be aware of this not no market stays the same for multiple years um how how what can the pages or sales pages do better you got to look at it sometimes you just have really crappy pages just don't don't sell the product well and what can you do about the offer itself okay so the sales page one is very simple but what can you do about the offer to make it more unique or a better fit for example if you're selling the same thing as the entire marketplace how can you make this product stand out how can you make it a better fit for a specific type of customer how could you even market to a different type of customer that is a better fit for example convertkit when they were doing email marketing they didn't compete with mailchimp and trying to recruit everybody need to send emails they went after bloggers they made the product it was most specific and functional for bloggers because of that they could run ads to bloggers extremely efficiently that's how they made a more unique product that's how they got better proc market fit and that's the market needing something that you're selling is not already being sold to them it fits the market it fits what is needed in the market and the market badly wants exactly what you're selling you can always change the market you can change what you're selling look at this because it's important okay you also have to ask yourself what procs for example when i was selling a product based around building your business or whatnot i'd ask myself all right at the end of the webinar if a person's not buying it why aren't they buying it it's because they don't think it will work for them so i got to ask myself why don't people think this will work for them okay do they understand it look at your pitch and offer and think do people actually understand this do they if i ask them what are you buying and what's it going to do for you and how does it work do you can they do that because if a person doesn't understand what they're buying they're not going to buy it okay crazy little thing understanding is imperative for people to buy something are they motivated enough to buy it so for example if i'm selling a and i'm just going to use the make money online example because it's so easy to explain because it's just a base human emotion if a person is happy with their job and comfortable why would they buy make money online product okay if a person is happy with their body weight why would they not if they're comfortable being fat why would they buy a weight loss product what you need to do is if a person is comfortable with their acne and their skin you have to make them uncomfortable with it that's called causing a little bit of pain at the beginning of your sales pitch think about stuff like that how are people in enough pain to buy something people usually buy something they get an emotion and most times when they buy products escape some sort of pain okay for example i bought this microphone because i watched my videos and it was painful for me to sound scoochy and not sound professional in my videos so if i want to actually sell this microphone better i would show videos of people having that painful product problem and then showing how much it's losing them in sales how much how embarrassing it is how it makes them look stupid online compared to competitors that will cause me pain then i'll buy a microphone it's imperative are people in pain when they're doing that why don't people think it's a sure thing you know for example if i was super mad about my microphone and i didn't buy this microphone why why don't i think this microphone will improve my results a lot of times customers just don't think your product will work for them ask them if you have like a webinar where you're selling like i don't know a guitar training class why don't people think they will learn how to play guitar by the end of it and then you can address that in your sales pitch well i you know i'm a beginner and i don't think i'm have enough time address that in your sales pitch okay um is it a sure is the sure thing worth the price for example this microphone right here i believe is 270 bucks this better sound to me is worth it to me if this thing was 10 000 i would not buy this microphone i simply would not i would i would find some alternative you also had to ask yourself is the thing you're selling if it would 100 work for the customer worth of them so for example if i was selling and make money online course of course making as much money as you want for the rest of your life that's a hundred that's worth a hundred thousand dollars the thing is people don't believe it's a sure thing therefore they're not going to buy it so the price is relevant to them believing it's a sure thing the more you can make them feel the sure thing the more likely they're going to buy it which can swing both ways because if they buy something it's a sure thing and it doesn't end up being a sure thing you'll be in trouble all right so all the people that sell make money online products you'd be careful um and then finally why don't they believe it's a sure thing and then finally if that's one of the cases how can you remove the thing that stops it from being a sure thing can you do work for them can you fill in the blanks can you give them templates can you automate processes can you do it for them for example when people were buying hirose they worry if they could set tracking on their own we said don't worry we'll handle that part okay so again if you're not tracking your ads correctly you should check out hiros because if you do you'll make twenty percent more from your ads oh here's another secret all right if your ads are broken it might be because you're not tracking accurately and you're inaccurately bidding and spending the wrong amounts on the ads and then you're also feeding that data back to the ad platform which is bad data instead of using accurate data which leads to you even having worse targeting so maybe if you like your ads are off by 20 30 or something like that maybe you should track them correctly maybe you should schedule call hiros below we guarantee you're going to see a 20 to 30 increase in your ads so that being said this is all i have for you in the video this is how i have fixed every ad campaign i've ever had that can be fixed some ad campaigns need to be taken out back and shot okay just lying out there but this is how i fixed every single ad campaign that i've ever had a problem with it never came from finding some secret bidding strategy in the ad manager it always always always always came from focusing on those three different layers of the the offer that i'm

TITLE: 2021 BEST FB Ad RETARGETING Guide (Mega High ROI Placments)
VIDEO ID: u7GqHyBA8O4
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7GqHyBA8O4
================================================================================

hyrulean you ever sit around and think yourself i wish i knew how to retarget better i wish i had retargeting ads that made a lot more money i wish i knew the proper way to set up a long retargeting campaign to follow people around the internet and convince them to buy my stuff well i think it's pretty obvious that's what we're going to get into in today's video i'm going to show you retargeting campaigns i've set up that miss just made tons of money they work really well and you spend very very very very very little money to actually get these results because the people are already pre-warmed they're already predisposed to buy you just need to know when to hit them and when to hit them and you're going to see some really juicy results that being said we're going to dive into it that's it let's get into it okay guys so when it comes to really crushing retargeting especially in 2021 there's three things you need to look at first off where are you going to be collecting retarding lists from and how are you going to be marketing to them on top of that secondly using your retargeting like a secondary email list instead of using your email list is a strategy you need to know about if you do this you're going to you're going to see huge results with your business especially when it comes to promotions affiliate offers other things you're promoting upsells down cells et cetera most people don't consider this part of the equation right here third you need to understand how you attribute it i know you're probably rolling your eyes saying you know alex ceo of hyrus is going to talk about attribution again if you don't attribute and scale your retarding ads in relation to your cold ads you're going to make a lot of mistakes you're going to hurt your cold ads a whole lot or you're going to waste tons of money on retargeting ads you don't need to be targeting with you need to know the ratios to advertise with and you really can't get those unless you're using proper attribution and you're aware of it most people aren't and they do all sorts of goofy stuff so let's talk about all the places you need to be collecting retargeting first off okay so my biggest thing i'm going to tell you first off is don't over complicate retargeting i see people that have like these deep funnels and people come through it and they all always just it's just not it's just not going to get you the results you're looking for the best thing you need to do is focus on how to make funnels and offers like the train you see on this channel because that's going to get you those three to five xrys and your eye and your ads and i break down the funnels and everything that's worked a lot on this channel just subscribe watch the other videos on this channel and on top of that i release about three thousand dollars in ad courses in our community post tab so if you're subscribed to me you're gonna see those posts about once every two weeks i keep them up for about a day and i take them down that's why you should subscribe because you're not gonna see those posts from me unless you're subscribed to this channel so if you do ads or run a business of any kind that runs ads subscribe or you're a psychopath because i release the best ad content online that being said i see people and they try to put retargeting on all the different pages of their site like a blog post that does this one thing and uh maybe a pricing page on your site and then they run different ads based on the pages the site they view at look is that going to get you slightly better roi's yes but it's not going to be make or break and it's probably going to distract you so much that you're not getting able to comprehend it all in your mind and you're not gonna be able to do move effectively because it's too complex okay so the biggest thing i need to teach you about retargeting is that if you keep it simple you're probably gonna get better results okay so the way to keep it simple is to collect retargeting from two places and then treat these two places differently or two categories so your first level retargeting is just going to be anybody that visits your website not your ad landing pages or funnels your website okay so if someone comes to highrest.com and clicks anywhere on this website that's where we're going to be getting all juicy with okay all right so keep that in mind now emails anybody that puts in their email on your website just needs to be on your retargeting list period okay and then finally youtube and any of your content youtube is able to generate great retargeting lists so for example when i send training to my customers when i put this training online the youtube retarding lists are spot on because there isn't all the blocks and everything that you're seeing other places youtube and google are very aware of who's watching a youtube video that has no problem tracking those and just marketing to that user or customer whereas if it's on the website youtube and google have to line up what it's on the website with who's using their platform they have access to directly who's watching on youtube okay so the way you're going to market to these customers right here in particular is slightly different in how you're going to market the people that click ads okay and we can actually move youtube down here but i'll talk about how to do it in different situations so if these type of ads right here we're not going to send people to the top of our funnel we're just going to send people to go for the kill okay because if people have entered their email they've already in our funnel people on our website reading around around they've already entered our funnel okay so we want to send them back just the point where they need to buy it so for example when i'm using this on hi-ros i'm going to send people on our retargeting ads just right back here okay just write to the main landing page not to a funnel not to anything else because i don't really need them to do other steps i already have access to their information i don't need to collect information on them and i'm going to be using my retargeting ads like a second email list so again i don't really need to be collecting their email and going through the whole deep funnel i want to get them to book a call so a lot of times with these type of pages sending people back to the main sales page sending people right back to the actual page where something or the objective is being done it's going to work a lot better it's a lot simpler and we don't need to be sending them down our funnels again okay just keep sending them to the goal point that's at least what works for us very well okay now we're going to do that for people that visit our website our email list and youtube in general just send them straight to the offer this works great for us okay now what also you need to consider is people that click your ads aka the people that land on the top of your funnel or click an ad or people that have recently watched your youtube you need to you need to split test and see which one works better for this right here so for example if you're watching this video right now you're just going to get ads literally just sending you straight to our call booking page you should book a call at hiros we literally guarantee you'll get better ad results in your ad so you don't pay for it okay that's why like literally every big influencer on planet earth is using us right now anywho not to brag about harass but when you're sending people and retargeting people in your funnels what i suggest doing is anybody clicks the ad just send them right back to the original opt-in page or landing page for your ads don't go crazy and like hit them up with a completely different ad and a completely different offer just use the same ads to them over and over again this works great okay again you could make special ads for people who've already clicked your like how you come back do this thing whatever a lot of times if people haven't interacted with your funnel or gone down the funnel they don't remember enough for that really to be effective so hit them with their most effective ad over and over and over again so they finally do what you want as soon as they enter your funnel move them into this just basically sending them the offer over and over again this works great and it's easy now the reason why you want to use these big giant audiences right here instead of using microns is again ios 1 14 has and i always name it the wrong thing it's either 1.4 or 14 i'm an idiot by the way you shouldn't ever watch anything i say anyways micro items just don't do very well and you just can't get the amount of traction you need with them because the targeting is just so small okay so it usually happens when you use micro audiences that you just can't get the the the reach that you need okay and you're just gonna be marketing the same like two people over and over again it's it's keep it to the bigger audiences and now the other thing i want to talk to you about that's really important is email lists don't work quite like they used to okay so for example people used to live and die by their email list and you understand people don't really check their email that much anymore they have like 16 different email addresses and they don't they don't it's just not how they get their information anymore and it's not an effective way to communicate with your customers not that email is bad i'm saying you need to start viewing retarding ads as your second email list or actually your main email list why is look if i get someone's email i can only message them about once per week with a marketing message before they stop opening if your email open rates go down you you you your delivery just gets tanked google just says no you're not you're not you're not hitting the inbox anymore that's just how it's going to work okay so what you need to do instead is look at these different layers of retargeting as your different email list so for example if i have a new offer or an upsell or something i want to promote to my customers what i want to do is use these lists that i have right here specifically existing customer lists which are going to be these ones right here people actively investigating our product without needing an ad and so i can go and follow these people around on the google display network on youtube on all the facebook platforms do this right here with a simple image ad even it's pretty much impossible for kirsten your customer to get on the internet without being hit by you okay so whenever i'm making a new promotion anything like that i'm just going to load up a gdn ad a youtube ad a facebook ad usually just image based and hit all my customers with that maybe for two to three days look ads don't have to be a long term thing you can run an ad for two to three days when it's roi is exceptionally high and then turn it off okay ads don't have to be long term you can use them as promotional things because you're only hitting your most active of active customers so that's how i would use retargeting right now there's a few things you need to be very very careful of when you're doing retargeting the first and foremost thing you need to be super aware of in facebook ads i'm going to tell you about when it comes to attribution and setting up your campaigns we go and look at this campaign right here i've set this on before this video so you can see what it looks like on default but you're going to see detailed targeting expansion is on this is facebook's way of breaking out and just going and marketing to everybody and blowing up your ad spend turn it off okay turn it off you don't need this on here you don't need detailed targeting expansion because it's gonna break outside your list okay it's going to break outside your list of people you can target it's just going to be a big old mess make sure to turn that off that's absolutely huge now on google ads make sure when you're creating a new campaign for your retargeting make sure to just set it to website traffic so you're gonna get as many clicks as possible because you're just you're not targeting things that need to have optimization to the pixel that the list is too small when it comes to retargeting to need an ai to optimize for you're already messaging and running ads to your targeted customer you don't need the ai for this so just set the website traffic and just you want to get as many clicks as possible that's it that's all you want to get all right now remember display and video and discovery are all different things you can remark it with okay so video ads are going to be ads that really go and interrupt people's youtube videos display is going to follow people around the internet display works a lot better as an email list alternative because you can just have your little face popping up on every website the person's on it's almost like having a notification okay discovery you can put stuff in gmail you can run the little you can run special promotions from that usually not going to get you the best bang for your buck it can work you should try it and you have video so usually when i'm going to do like a remarketing campaign a short promotion one i'm going to use both of these every single time if i'm going to do a promotional campaign i might use discovery in some cases but i'm too lazy most the time so i just use this now you also need to understand finally when you're using display or video or remarketing what happens is you burn through the customers very quickly this means that you really don't need this means that you don't really don't need to be spending that much on your ads for about 340 bucks i got a thousand views on it and that's a large amount of my retargeting list okay so that's a large amount of people coming in here and so you need to understand if you crank this up to like 100 150 200 bucks a day we're just going to be messaging people way too much and wasting ad spend you want remarketing campaigns not to be polite by any means but you don't need to be hitting people three times a day with your remarketing ads one ad per day is about what you're going to be looking for so when you're looking at the frequency in your ads and you're saying the views and everything try to hit a person at .5 times a day so every other day try to look for that type of frequency when you're running your ads if not it's just going to burn and hit the person over and over again and it's just unnecessary and so what people do a lot of times that's finally going to mess you up is they're they're going to see a retarding campaign pop off and they're going to increase the ad spend when really what happens a lot of time is the initial ad was clicked and then someone sees the retarding campaign and so what really needs to be increased is this ad you don't need to be increasing the spend on a retarding campaign the best way to actually do that and see that is using something like scientific mode and hirose okay so here's a perfect example of this this going haywire so when people search the hi-ros keyword obviously they've already seen an ad or something in the future so if i'm looking at this this mode right here in hi-ros traffic and of course i can dive into our dashboards and see the tracking way deeper so here's a perfect situation on this right here so here's our search campaigns you can see our search campaigns right here last click are not doing so well okay they're not they're not doing as well as the scientific mode what scientific mode is is basically this let's say we got a 15 day span right here and we have a sale that happens within the 15 days or outside the 15 days so let's say this is the first click right here let's say the sale occurs on a last click okay so if the sale occurs within 15 days of the first click or any time span i set it's going to go to this first click sale i want to attribute it there because that's the campaign and needs to be scaled we could even lower it down to like three days or five days or something like that this is the campaign that's during the sales now if a retargeting ad or an ad generates a sale outside of the 15 days so it's been 15 days since the first click we obviously don't want to attribute this to the first click we want to give it to the last click okay so if we're targeting ad campaigns and other sources what continually happens is you can see the same thing is happening right here in our search campaigns the search campaign is actually starting a lot of the sales but it's not finishing a lot of them okay you need to be able to see that across facebook your youtube ads your email marketing and whatnot if you don't see this what could happen right here is i can only see in last click mode when i'm using my accurate tracking i could i could think it's not doing that well and i could turn this off okay but if i turn this off i'm gonna be hurting my retarding campaigns this thing helps retargeting it helps our secondary traffic sources it helps other ads on other platforms immensely thus i can crank this one up to keep seeing results okay so it's incredibly important you do that with your ads and even when you have multiple traffic sources are you going to be turning off things based on the last click that isn't accurate okay so that's the last thing i can tell you you should pick up hi-ros i don't understand why you'd run ads without it i don't care what you do if if you run i don't care if you even hire a guy with a wiffle bat to chase people down and hit them after they buy something asking where they came from you need to know this information or you're going to be scaling up the wrong things okay so for example in this situation i would scale this campaign down and then increase my retarding campaigns or my other campaigns and other traffic sources that aren't generating the initial click or sale and then those would have been failed campaigns and i would have been turning off the campaigns making the most money you do that you're gonna make less money don't make less money so that's the lesson for the day guys that's how everything that i see happening as far as retargeting ads go again subscribe to this channel i release new videos every single week and i post links to free courses that you can get there you can go buy them for 3 000 or somewhere else or you

because this is the biggest hack when it comes to running facebook and youtube ads if you understand how to structure an offers in this way you're gonna kill it every single person i know it's made 10 20 30 million dollars worth of sales plus via ads they're doing this every other person i know that's getting mediocre results constantly and can't escape out of this and is trying to do all sorts of complex stuff they don't do this okay until you do this you're going to keep wasting money it's going to be a struggle and it's going to be terrible because i had the same exact experience before i started applying this real quick if you're new here i'm alex becker i'm ceo of hiros again we're the fastest growing ad analytics cup in the world this gives me a little bit of insight in what's working with ads i also run the most successful ad mastermind online based on results i have more six seven eight-figure results than anybody else ever with ad masterminds it's really cool and i'm not saying that so you can join it i'm just saying i need i kind of know what's going to be working with facebook and youtube ads and so in this video i'm just going to show you exactly the type of offers that work and if you understand how to make an offer like this oh it's going to be juicy it's going to be fun you're going to you're going to you're going to have a lot of juice you can have juice parties everyone be like where'd you get all that juice and you'd be like from this alex becker video which has the content i'm gonna show you right now and i'm gonna stop rambling let's get into it alright guys so let's talk about this because this is actually in my opinion and i know i always say this but this is the number one secret to running really successful ads so the problem that i see with almost every ad campaign that won't scale or once it just won't work at all you might have always been just confused why does my offer not work with ads why can't i get this on ads why does it never work with ads it's because the offer is not made to work with ads you know we got to really think what type of offer is going to work with ads not all offers work with ads for example something i constantly see businesses fail at is they make a low ticket software for example when i made market hero okay this thing ranged from nineteen dollars to let's just say a thousand dollars per month with the vast majority of users being in the forty nine dollar uh to one hundred dollar range and also had a 14 day free trial all right this offer right here absolutely sucked with ads why well first off email marketing very saturated there's already tons of other things in the market but on top of that it was very hard to ever make a profit upfront selling it like this in fact it was impossible one people just go to the front of the site and try to free trial uh or they take it through there and even when we work out the free trial numbers it was very hard to make our money back unless we were willing to wait three months for all the rebills to come in which is actually a great setup if we're looking at ltv profit but when i'm running ads i want to make profit up front because the more profit you make up front the farther you can scale look if you're making if you're spending a thousand dollars and make five thousand dollars you can scale so far to the point that you're spending five thousand dollars to make five thousand dollars and you're just getting all the customers in and let's just look at it this way all right so let's imagine so let's imagine it like this okay so let's imagine this is the amount of leads per day that we get with 5 000 leads per day being down here 1 000 up here okay and let's look at our roi at you know a 5x right here all right so 5 000 back a day for a thousand dollars spent and a 0x right here right we're able to actually go and fuel our business this way because we have so much profit margin to wiggle our scale into so we could scale maybe 5 10 15 times farther and get way more customers into our business which we can then make money on the back end from which is where everybody should make money anyways okay and so this offer here doesn't work and i've seen people try it with like a 47 offer i've seen people try 99 offers i just see them try and sell their supplements i see them try and sell books and then what eventually happens is they have to take these offers that don't work and put something in front of them like a book funnel or something like that they have to go and put weird stuff in front of it or a trip wire and they end up having to do all these things in order to sell this offer that they would rather just that's their core offer okay so when you're thinking about your business maybe you have an offer that just won't work with ads it's just been extremely difficult to work with ads what you don't want to do is take an offer that's not designed to work for ads and run ads to it what you want to do is you want to let's say this is your core offer you want to put something in front of it that's designed for ads or you want to design your product from the get go to work with ads so for example iros is uh it's 347 a month on the lowest level okay easily gets people 10x roi you guys should check out hiros because if you're running ads without hirose you're actually functionally insane it pays for itself 10 times over we guarantee that result with tracking and correct attribution people can scale much further they save a ton of money it's just a known fact at this point this is where we have literally every influencer big info marketer large e-commerce brands sas companies this is why it's the fastest eye tracking company growth wise in the world right now okay it just works you should you should use it enough about that though but there's a reason why i only allow us to sell it at 3 500 up front you have to buy one year up front why why is this why do we require a phone call for this why don't i just sell it for the free trial why don't i sell uh 29 packages 99 packages well there's a reason because we like to provide super stellar support okay and we can't provide super stellar one to one support at these prices right here but another secondary reason right here uh that i don't allow three forty seven dollar signups is because this works exceptionally well with ads okay look the number one funnel for ads by far are call funnels to high ticket products by far why the conversion rates on a five thousand ten thousand dollar product especially when you work in a phone funnel work out to just generate a far better roi i've talked about this every single time i talk about ads in these videos if you have a thousand people in let's say you're paying ten dollars per lead and you're selling a 50 product and you have a 10 conversion rate so you sell 100 of these and 10 is insane i've never seen anybody achieve that ever we're gonna make five thousand dollars back okay we're gonna lose money on this thing if we get a thousand leads in and we have a eight thousand dollar product and we get a point zero two conversion rate okay our point two percent look my math is going to be terrible but a point 0.2 conversion rate right here yeah 0.2 math is correct right there we're going to make sixteen thousand dollars and six thousand dollars profit and this is much easier to achieve than this okay especially when you have a cough line right there so when you're thinking to yourself all right how am i going to get leads in my business because what we talked about last videos one of the most profitable things you can do is use your ads as legion free legion and the way you do that is if you cover ad costs if you eliminate this let's say we're getting uh we can get 3 000 leads in a day uh and we spend 10 000 okay that that stinks for 3 000 leads we're down 10 000 per day but if we make 10 000 back it becomes a free three thousand dollar leads which we can then sell on our backlink back end for all infinity and make tons of money now if we can make money let's say we make 5k profit on that uh 10k let's say we make 15k back every day that's even sweeter because then we're making money on the front end and the back end but this is very hard to do unless that product is designed for ads okay so we have to think about what type of product is best for ads i'll tell you what i would look for it has to be high ticket the higher ticket the better if i can sell something for 10 15 000 that's what i'm gonna do that's the service i'm gonna design that's what i'm gonna use to get leads in for example let's say our main product was like workout courses or something like that like we're selling 99 150 uh workout courses and supplements what i would do is i would make a 10 000 super offer like an event or something like that on the front end and i would use that as my thing is everybody who comes in from this going to buy the ten thousand dollar thing no but if point two percent of them do the other 99.8 percent can then become customers of our main product that's that's the goose right there okay so the first thing you want to do is you want to make it as high ticket as possible even if you have to make another product to be super high tickets you could sell your most high ticket level form of coaching on your front end use that that will cover ad cost then you can sell all your smaller things to people that don't buy the highest ticket thing also sell it on the phone if you can buy a call funnel or if you can make a call funnel work this is what gets you the best rois so what can be super high ticket what can be sold on the phone next what is missing in the marketplace this is one of the best things you need to look at so many people go out there and they sought at one prog let's say sam evans consulting course okay well about 50 200 consulting courses later if you go through youtube there's about 200 of these damn things you're going to be running ads against so many people that the cost acquire customer is so expensive just due the choices the customer has okay if the original pie of this marketplace right here was 100 million dollars and you could originally get a customer for let's say you could get a lead in for one dollar well the more people that start bidding on this the lower the profits get so let's imagine if we have 200 courses right here each course can only make two million bucks maybe some of them stand up and make five times more another but again it's it's extremely difficult when you're not the only person going for this thing and the cost per lead is going to skyrocket because all these people that have courses are going to start paying more and more so what happens is the cost per lead goes up and the total profit you can make is down so what can you do against these niches instead let's say you're in the consulting niche figure out a service that is high ticket you can sell on the phone to consulting businesses that nobody else is selling maybe it's optimizing their social media maybe it's optimizing their email campaigns maybe it's optimizing their youtube ads maybe it's going and getting them published on forbes or something like that find the service that much fewer people are selling that appeals to your target market so if you're selling the consultants and you got a 2 000 course or something like that or a membership or high ticket coaching or whatever think hmm how can i use a front-end maybe done for you service it's super expensive for consultants people will come in here to learn about it or get information on it or whatnot and then i can get them into here this is how you would go out there and really crush it with ads see what you need to understand is that when you're making ads it's like you're getting in a dog fight now look there's all sorts of roles for all sorts of dogs a chihuahua a poodle you know it's great for sitting on a paris hilton's lap doesn't mean the dog can't make money it doesn't mean the dog can't be a successful business but when you're going into an ad arena you're going against other people so you need to have a pitbull all right you need to genetically breed an offer to be a pitbull you need to make an offer specifically for ads first don't make the offer and then make the ads make the think about the ads and design the offer around the ads and then use the pitbull offer to get people in get leads in and then you can sell them poodles okay you can sell them poodles at a massive profit margin and then you're not paying a massive cost to get them in there that is how you kill it that is how i have grown high rose that is how i grew my last company market hero for example what we did is i said okay cool this offer this 49 per month offer absolutely tanking it not working at all i'm losing so much money up front it's not going to work well what i did instead is i made a 2 offer that i sold through a webinar okay and then i got people in to this webinar we made like a a 0.5 to sometimes 4x roi on the webinar when all payment plans and everything were coming in long story short it would to get leads in and then let's say i got 50 000 leads a month okay cool i can get a thousand of these people to sign up for my software that's ten thousand but you get it i get a thousand these people to sign up for my software bam my recurring revenue is increasing by 50k a month and this is where the real money starts coming because once i get this let's say we increase this this revenue this recurring revenue the 300k per month okay i'm just making this passively on top of it increasing and it's all fueled by this thing right here so i have a very successful business right here because if i just sold this thing right here this money wouldn't be made i'm able to make a little bit of money right here by selling the high ticket offer that's genetically bred for ads and i'm able to get leads in for free and so there i have a nice 350 k per month business this isn't our revenue and the numbers we were doing we actually did way more on this offer and what we're doing right here i'm just giving you right here i have a nice 350k per month business without ever having to lose money on ads that's how you make offers for ads that's what kills it on facebook so depending on what you're doing let's say you have supplements find a high ticket offer maybe a done-for-you camp a huge bundle of your your supplements together with an info marketing course find something you can sell for a thousand and two thousand dollars up front say you're selling courses find some ten thousand five thousand dollar done for you service you can sell up front that attracts the target customer okay say you're selling a sass find a way when you're designing your sas in the first place the best thing to do is find a way to make a high-ticket sas where you can sell enterprise maybe a 25 000 per month package or something like that that's where it's going to become so easy to run ads at because you can spend five thousand dollars just to get one customer you know you could spend 25 000 to get one customer and it's 12x profitable in a year that's that's where the juice is at say you're making a software or something like that so that being said guys that's the lesson for the day if you do this this is makes this is made this has been my secret to running ads this has been every successful business i know that has had a lot of success running ads without much effort they sell something they sell something matches the criteria they use the strategy i talked about selling low ticket things selling things that are not optimal for ads makes your life hard selling low ticket reoccurring things you lose money up front you have to wait six months you sell these complicated funnels they fall apart you have like these tripwire seven dollar ten dollar fifteen dollar thing it just becomes a real mess and it's hard to manage and you should check out the video from uh earlier this week where i talk about the perfect funnels for these things but if you can just make a big simple offer which the simplest way to make an offer and sell a high ticket is a call funnel that's the juice you're in so that being said guys one thing i would suggest use hyrus track accurately it will improve your roi on your ads 15 and 20 would literally guarantee it or you don't pay for it on top of that if you want help growing your business like i

TITLE: This 2 Page FB AD Funnel Made $20 MILLION! (Advanced 2021 FB Ad Funnel Guide)
VIDEO ID: 8JigXUfomxk
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JigXUfomxk
================================================================================

in this video I'm going to show you the best funnel strategy for Facebook and YouTube ads I'm not kidding I've been applying this to my funnels for years I've had one funnel on Facebook and YouTube ads over $20 million in sales my current funnel is scaled High RIS to being the fastest growing ad analytics company in the entire world right now it works really really really well and I have multiple friends whove used this exact strategy have done over 50 million 20 million 30 million big numbers everywhere shoot the fireworks off okay it works period if you apply this to your ads you're going to see much much much much better results and I barely know anybody that has had massive success without this and I know hundreds hundreds of people that are mediocre at Facebook and YouTube ads that just completely ignore this Rule and they will be forever until they appreciate this rule the whoopings and wasted ad spend will continue until you do this have I sold this well enough okay great real quick my name is Alex Becker I'm the CE of hyros ran a lot of ads I've made a lot of money from ads understand the ads pretty well and I have access to the entire data from across the entire industry so I can tell you exactly what is going to work with your ads on Facebook YouTube and everywhere else and what's not going to work I also have the best ad Mastermind on planet earth based on results I have more 6 seven eight figure results than any other AD Mastermind online right now so again I see what works I see what doesn't and on these videos I tell you what does and doesn't and that's exactly what we're going to do here so let me break down the strategy before we get start here's the number one thing you need to understand about ads that very few people grasp I see people do when they start hitting scale resistance with their ads is they make different funnels and different ads so the most common mistake I see that is going to stop you from ever ever ever having a world class funnel and a funnel that can scale to the Moon from your ads is you're going to go and I see people get to let's say I don't know $2,000 a day and they stop being able to generate a profit so what they think to themselves is oh what I need to do is I need to make another funnel and another funnel and so if this one right here makes let's just I know these are big numbers for some people let's just use them in in context with whatever numbers you're doing this fun right here makes $4,000 a day back here s of 2x Roi their logic is I'll make another one and then I'll make another one and I'll make another offer and I'll make another weird funnel that goes in this off right here I'm going to try all these different ways to scale by adding different offers and different entry funnels to this this is the dumbest thing you can ever do inight of ads it's the number one reason why people do not have success with ads and why they cannot scale okay if you've ever hit a point where you just keep getting resistance and you keep making new funnels this is exactly why in order for an ad to work it has to be profitable duh okay but in order for an ad to work at scale it has to be profitable at scale these are this is such a stupid duh statement like of course I get that Alex but here's what you're not understanding in order for an ad to be profitable at scale I don't know how I'm explaining this the ad has to be phenomenal the funnel the offer and the ad have to be on effing point and the only way to get an ad in a funnel on point on effing point is to spend a crazy amount of time on them and optimize them to the zillionth degree okay so for example when I was running hcom I scaled that to over $20 million in sales $25,000 End Sales a level most people won't ever get to I'm not saying I'm the greatest I'm saying I've gone to a level that a lot of people pursued getting to that's what I'm saying so that funnel had to be rebuilt that offer the pitch the ads everything had to be redone many many many many many times at least seven times the funnel broke down stopped working as we started scaling it up or we were at scale and it would just slowly fall apart and go down during this time period I saw competitors and people trying to mimic me they'd make new funnels for their product they'd make a a book funnel they'd make this funnel they'd make that funnel they never caught up when I just kept working on the same damn funnel why is this well it's very simple when you're running ads you're running ads against other people's funnels okay so let's imagine we're running a YouTube ad right here well guess what we got funnel number a uh from let's just tell let's just keep it simple we got it that from business a business B business C Business D and then imagine we go all the way down the alphabet because everybody's trying to run a funnel if you're in a niche that's even slightly competitive there's probably like 10 other people 15 20 100 other people trying to run ads for your same Niche so the way you pull ahead and win at ads is you have to actively beat other people you have to be able to get a better Roi from your ads than other people because if they can get a better Roi they will out bid you for example if you make $2 for uh every dollar you spend well guess what if you have a competitor that makes $5 for every dollar he spends he's simply going to start increasing his bids until it's until you're at a point where you make $2 for every $2 you make he's going to increase the bid where he doesn't have to spend a dollar anymore to get a lead he'll spend $2 to get a lead so if you for example again I'm explaining this very poorly just let me dumb this down even more let's say you spend $1 to get a lead and you make back he spends $1 to get a lead he makes $5 back well he's just going to increase the bid till it's $2 per lead so he can get more of the leads that's simply what that's how the bidding algorithm works it goes to a win or take all and so in order for your funnel to scale to the next point you have to get to the point where your funnel makes a better Roi than any other funnel that you're competing against or at least a better Roi than 95 90% of them if you're in that lower 10% you just get out bid that's how this animal take eat what dog eat dog ad game works and so only way to make sure your funnel wins and the only true way to scale is to have a dominant funnel if you have a dominant funnel you can scale it to $100 million I know multiple people multiple people who have done 20 50 hundred million plus in sales in Revenue they only had one main entry funnel what how did they do this is it's because they're funnel one and beat all the other funnels when you have a funnel that beats every other funnel you don't need any other funnels you can just scale that one to the Moon because you can spend more than other people and when you spend more on other people eventually what happens is you got the entire range of people who get an Roi in their funnel and once you get to the point where you're the king of the castle right here you just Escape you you escape this threshold right here where you really don't have any competitors when it comes to ads and then your ad just takes off because there's no one else left buying traffic at that price and so if you're making a lot of our Y at that price guess what you you got it that's that's the biggest key to funnels on here so the number one thing I can teach you of all things is you want to make one funnel to rule them all in your business one entry point funnel okay your your business should never ever I'm just going to give you tip number two your business never ever ever should just be one funnel and ads and going to a prog that's the silliest thing on planet Earth you should have funnels so people can enter your business and then they come into your business and they buy more things later on okay or they come back and buy it because they have a good experience with the funnel at the start but until your business is doing 1020 million per year I really don't see much use for having five or six different ad base entry funnels I just don't maybe you can have retargeting funnels in the back end and go to your existing customers but there's no point to have one more than one entry funnel because that thing can just be super optimized to work and generate customers better than anything else so what makes a great entry funnel first off it's easy and simple seriously all right I cannot tell you how many people I I I am the CEO of hrus I I can see what's working across the industry and what's not I cannot tell you how many people I know that are making crazy amounts of money and they just have a basic call or webinar funnel or uh High ticket sales video funnel I can't tell you I can't tell you the numbers are endless and I can I cannot also name to you how many people who have impressive stats with complicated funnels whether it's a book funnel whether it's like a weird survey funnel it's an up or down funnel where they do a handstand I'm sure you've seen all of them upsell down cell wazu funnel they're all a mess why because when you have tons of moving Parts when you have tons of moving connections when you need to get really high conversions on a low ticket product or something like that there's so many different moving parts to optimize and each part of the funnel is its own Beast to optimize so if I have a call funnel which is very very basic okay let's just look at let's just look at the hyros ad for example all right our ads go straight to a page where a person just books a call okay and then let's look at all the moving parts of that funnel just from this simple basic funnel all right we got the ad itself okay we got the landing page okay we got the book A call Page all right which I'm just going to put a square around it then we have the follow-up process of the call they get them on the there we got the pitch itself on the call uh and then we got the offer okay that's a lot of moving parts to optimize I can spend all day just optimizing the ads I can spend all day optimizing this part I can spend all day optimizing this part and this part the pitch itself working with the sales team the offer that's more than I could possibly wrap my damn head around that is that is a full-time thought process right here the SEC this is enough to completely overwhelm my mental capacity maybe you're a genius I'm not and I don't even know if I got this all drawn up correctly okay cool yeah it's all focused in the frame great see I can't even run this damn presentation effectively if we just 2x this this is something my brain can't even optimize or comprehend if we if I were to make another call funnel or like a webinar funnel on top of this or like a book funnel no if this strategy required me to sell like a book and then have a downsell number one down sell number two and like three to four different sales videos no I couldn't do it it's just too damn much information to optimize it's too many buttons and toggles optimized because every little thing affects every other thing on here okay so that's why when you see some of the most successful funnels of all time Sam Vin's webinar funnel very basic it's just a webinar that's it sells $2,000 Pro build his entire business around that one webinar funnel you go look at the initial funnel that took off clickfunnels just a webinar funnel go look at alexos funnel that did like 50 hundred million sales just a pitch funnel you look at almost any agency or e-commerce business they usually just have one funnel where everybody gets in at now of course as businesses get bigger you can have a marketing team you have different entry points you could be expanding in the different markets let's say uh for example I want to expand hyros to focus on agencies okay of course I could have a different agency funnel to Target a different type of customer but a lot of people have multiple different funnels for the same type of customer our customers are extremely similar that's wonky that's craziness and you should focus on maxing out that particular customer which again if if your business can't get the $10 million a year on one particular type of customer you're kind of picking the wrong Niche okay so then what's the next thing we really want to focus on all right well one thing I would suggest just to make things simple make it high ticket whatever whatever is in your industry for example I see people with e-commerce funnels where they're selling like a $47 product or something wrong with there it's way easier if you just sell like a $300 product I've seen people bundle information and and a a bundle of all their products together to make it high ticket why is this easier because with lower conversion rates your numbers will work out better I've talked about this a billion times on a channel go watch the other trainings we have a full YouTube course a full Facebook course full courses on literally everything on this channel when it comes to ads this just works better because just from a basic Roi all right it's a lot easier to get a 2 to 1% conversion on a high ticket product and it is to get a 7 to 10% conversion on a $47 product so we just put in basic math right here okay uh let's say we're paying $10 per lead and we get a th000 people in okay that's 10K okayy and we can get 10% of the convert on a $550 product okay so we get 100 people we just made $5,000 we're not making our money back right there we get a th000 people in and we get 1% of them we get 10% of them to convert on a 1K product or so 1% 1K product we just made our bunny back we just covered our ad cost the numbers simply work by default a lot better okay this is what you're going to see across the board across every industry another insanely useful tip I'm going to give you is find ways to connect with the customers in person on ad funnels why is this because if you can get a person on the phone or in a chat you can convert them to much higher products because you can sell them something something specific to them for example at hyos you know we survive because we have really high ticket products because we can sell people a customized solution that works for them okay this is why having some type of product that is designed for ads you want to sit back and this is the best advice I can also give you in a funnel is think about how you can make a funnel and offer with ads in mind not how you can make a funnel and offer or an offer and then find a way to make a funnel an ad that works for it so what does that mean don't make your offer first make the ads and think about what offer would be best for ads and then make the offer around the ads not the other way around because then when you're trying to match ads to your offer it doesn't always work together right not all not all offers are great with ads and it leads to the final Point use ad funnels not as your core business okay not as your core business you can and it makes it even simpler for example we only have one damn product at hyos we just have one but sometimes in businesses the best thing you can possibly do is use your ad funnel as an entry point so for example uh when I had my info funnel hcom I'd use as an entry point for my SAS business so people would buy this product right here and it would cover ad costs and it would allow me to then sell people a recurrent subscription at my other business for $99 to $500 a month okay so it allowed me to get people in for free to my business and then build a very large reoccurring income with this this is how you want to think about it think think about how your entry funnel sets up the rest of your business so for example the reason why clickfunnels sells information marketing on their front end while all their ads sell information marketing and not really clickfunnels it's because that covers ad costs and gets people into the business Russell then sells you a book or whatever else is going on that funnel I personally think that funnel is overly complicated but don't pat my you know click funnel is doing all right so just we'll leave it at that but you can see he sells a ton of stuff on the front end and indoctrinates and gets people in the you can you can create an infom marketing business you can sell courses online you can do whatever that you know they're doing over there and then they sell click phones in the back end which is where they make the huge reoccurring subscription fees okay the funnel sells products that are optimized for ads to cover ad cost they cover all the money that they spent on ads right here and they get tons of customers in for free then they sell them the reoccurring product and they're able to Market to the customer much cheaper through retargeting ads email marketing and their communities once they get a person in from this point of the direction right here so again very simple let's imagine we spend 10K in ads well they make 10K back from their info procs which are optimized to be sold for ads it's way easier to make money in your money back selling info procs than it's like a a reoccurring software it's nearly impossible to sell subscription software and make money on your ads it's it's in incredibly hard to do I've never seen it I haven't seen it done in years there might be someone I don't know who it is but you're not going to make front-end money whereas you run an ad and and it suddenly pumps out a 2xr same day but what they do out here is they do this and then when people come in here they make their money back however the person becomes an optimal customer that they can End Market to very easily whether they buy or not because they see the funnel they get to know brussell they get to know what click phones is all about then they can be retargeted sold to much cheaply much cheaper they can be marketed to on their email list and the person's probably going to join their communities which allows them to get them in the other thing pretty much for free so this cost money right here but the money the customer is for free and then they get them on a $99 subscription it's $1,000 per year and they gain $1,000 per year customer for free that's that's the funnel strategy that works okay so all these techniques right here one have one funnel two make the funnel easy to understand and operate three preferably make the funnel High ticket best way you can also do this is by finding ways to talk to the customers one-on-one as much as possible that allows you to sell them things that are much more expensive okay a much more expensive info product a much more expensive bundle yada yada y yada okay three or four make sure the funnel sets up the rest of the business what does it communicate to the customer how does your brand appear I see people try way too hard also to sell their front end prodcts and it burns out the customer before they get into the back of the business and this is truly where every business makes the tens of millions of dollars it's all in the back end the 10 millions of tens of millions of dollars in profit all right people make make all sorts of Revenue on their front end but until you separate that ad cost you can actually get people into your community and your actual funnels where you're not paying an arm and a leg to talk to them each time it's really going to be hard to make those juicy profit margins so guys that is the lesson for today realiz I put on a huie hoodie mid video that's the listen for the day guys if if you want to see how to grow your ads a lot more

VIDEO ID: hHJSoHQW1hE

================================================================================

point blank if you apply what i show you in this video to your landing pages you're going to see much higher conversions just period i'm going to walk you through some of my highest converting pages and some of the highest converting pages of all time that i've ever seen from youtube ads from facebook ads and i'm going to show you the micro optimizations and the big optimizations that i know other people have made and i have made and that for example people in my ad mastermind we have the best youtube ad results of any ad mastermind on planet earth i'm not telling you that to get you to join the mastermind i'm telling you that because i consistently show hundreds of people in this mastermind this exact strategy this exact landing page design and it just every single time improves their conversions so it works it's easy to do and i'm just going to show you this in this video if you want to know why i'm showing this my name is alex becker i'm the ceo of hyrus it's the fastest growing ad analyst company in the entire world i've also generated 10 plus million dollars in sales from facebook ads and over 20 million dollars in sales from youtube ads and i tell you exactly how i did that and how i've helped other people do it so as you will grow your business to a point with ads that you need proper attribution which is what hirose does if you just use proper attribution you're gonna see much much much higher rois on your ads and you're gonna save way way more money we actually guarantee that and we actually guarantee that and deliver that every single time which is why pretty much everybody uses hi-ros these days that being said i want to show you this so you can grow your ad account first so that maybe you come back around and use hiros in the future so let's just hop into it okay guys so let's talk about this by reviewing two of my most successful landing page styles of all time so what i see people try and do in their landing pages and i'm just going to give you about three or four tips you apply these you can do so much better tip number one stop trying to communicate so many different things okay so you can see in this one right here youtube ad template i've used to generate over 18 million dollars in sales get my copy and paste ad scripts and targeting swipe files you see how simple this is to comprehend what i see happen all the time with people in their landing pages is they try to convey like my ten step formula to help me move out of my parents house and finally achieve a financial freedom by xyz by using a secret amazon style thing get get your free bonus and template okay what you need to do is you want to focus on only using words in as few words as possible while still being extremely impactful without distracting the human mind in too many different directions and you want to communicate something very very simple in every page the results you're looking for in a repeatable easy way and then that's it okay without effort the results you're looking for without effort you can take anything else from anything it's that youtube ad template i've used to sales what does template can convey easy repeatable what is it that they want the result they're looking for money from youtube ads get my copy and paste ad scripts and targeting swipe files this again conveys without effort copy and paste without saying it this is extremely important on any type of opt-in or call booking page okay look how simple this page is right here and there's not much else being communicated why because what do we need to communicate let's just remove the the rest of this page right here okay because you're gonna see there's literally not much communicated right here okay but again it's communicating the same thing what are we communicating right here we don't need to communicate too much if a person wants this right here they're going to opt in for it and a little tip and give you an opt-in pages is find a way to hook in without effort and easy into something that they can download or copy or or obtain okay if you just offer that simply right there people are going to do it and you and if you focus on being very simple keeping everything else basic it's going to work that's why on opt-in pages that's why on my landing page designs whenever i link a page to an ad to a page i keep it abysmally simple that's why when you go to like apple's website you're going to see something very similar to my designs right here because i copied apple okay how highros uses ai tracking to instantly increase ad roi and really this page this video is going to mostly just be about headlines look how high-risk uses ai tracking increase at roi how you can get a higher ad roi without doing anything that's what gets them to watch the video that's it or you don't pay okay so this is this is basically saying you're going to get everything you want without any effort or you don't pay for it this is a this is a just look how simple the communication is i'm not using a lot of words i'm not explaining a lot because the point of headlines is to get people to read the rest of the pages to get people to take an action it's not to explain everything that's happening okay that's a huge thing you need to do on your landing page understand headlines are meant to get a person to take action and take interest in the rest of the page not explain everything that's going to be happening people try to do too much in every section instead of letting sections do their own thing okay so i'm not really going to talk about the sales video because if you actually go in this video there's an exact walk through step by step of how this sales video works the sales video converts like crazy and you get walked completely through it for free on our hirose blog or on our hirose channel right now so you should really subscribe to it and if you need help writing these things and whatnot check out my ad mastermind below we have more results than any other ad mastermind on planet earth you should check it out it works pretty well so look i want to also show you what's going on in this page right here when you're writing pages what a lot of people try to do is they try to follow just some template and marketing script because that's what makes sense but the most important thing i'm going to tell you on any page or any funnel that you make is focus on context of who you're talking to and what they're thinking when they land on the page of course copywriting tactics have their place but more so thinking what is a person going to think when they land on the page this is the best copywriting tactic it's worked very well for me i've done very well with ads so it at least works somewhat i will tell you that and what i do when a person lands on the page is i think what is the person going to do in the land of page they're going to come here and they're gonna we need to hook them with this so i gotta hook them then i gotta get them to watch this video but they're probably not gonna watch this video or like 50 of them won't watch this video okay so what am i going to do next well i'm just going to say if you're short or they're going to watch very little of it so what if people watch very little of it well they're going to get hit in the first two minutes with all the benefits of hyrus and all the excessive proof that we increase people's ad rois by 20 30 percent literally every time we guarantee it you should use it it's silly if you don't that being said i predicted people are going to only watch two to three minutes of the video so i assume they're just going to scroll down and say look if you're short on time do this now what people are going to do on this page also is they're going to skim through or they're gonna watch two minutes of this video and then they're gonna just pop up questions so what i do is i answer the questions i think they're gonna have right off the bat what is print tracking okay boom okay and then i explain it in very very simple terms i never use any complicated terms i never use a lot of text anywhere why have you seen how people use the internet people don't read anymore they just simply don't they read big chunks of words okay so i use big chunks of words and pictures in my copywriting now another thing i'm gonna tell you is look at how simple this page is a lot of people have graphics and griffins and wizards flying around their page i could do that if i wanted i have the designers to do it i could draw a raven you know fighting a unicorn with with cyborg implants if i wanted on this page but i don't for a spare specific reason i want to be communicated very simply i use black backgrounds white text or i would use white backgrounds and black text and you can see i'm not using tons of colors and i'm just using red to stand out in key places okay just to give it a little bit of flair so it's not super boring to look at why am i doing this because i don't want complication i want simplicity at all points of the page so that my message is communicated in an understandable way too many people try to have way too much going on in their pages i'm not going to review pages but you can go to any sas company page you go to anyone there's just so much text and so much information to digest people don't you're you only have probably 20 of a person's attention when they're looking their page they got they got their cryptocurrency prices in upper right-hand corner they got their facebook thing dinging off they got telegram pinging them you only have you have very little of the human brain okay so if you're going to try and communicate with them in a deep way it's just not going to happen that's when that's the job of the sales videos that's a job of your webinars that's the job of your sales calls teams okay what we're trying to do right here is just get the bare enough attention to make the person uh just understand we're gonna get them these results and then give them the book a call that's that's all we're trying to do okay so what does this page really show you're going to get the results without effort here's what it is here's why it works here's all the results it's gotten you want to book a call do you want to book a call do you want to book a call and most people are going to book a call at this point right here now of course when we're doing like a webinar funnel or a longer sales video you know we're going to have to rely on the sales video to do a lot more of the heavy lifting this is why you don't necessarily want giant pages of text when you're not going for something that's really easy like a phone call you usually just want just a sales video and then all the the rest of the hoop plot comes out that's what a webinar is for that's what a longer form video is for okay one other final thing i'm going to show you that just works really well is what i like to call the endless conga line of i'm just giving you random land and landing page tips in this video if you haven't figured out yet there's really no objective with this video i just sat down like what do people want what's going to help them landing page tips look one tag that i've used forever is called the conga line of results if back in the day when i used to launch procs on war for a forum and i was the general piece of uh just kidding i love you war reform people you're great um but look back in the day when i used to launch procs like like a goofball on forums one thing that was super powerful was just posting an endless scrollable line of results and so you're going to notice on almost every sales page i have i line up results in a way so that people have to scroll past them why because people don't read results they don't read results they they but they take in how much they're scrolling one thing you can do when you're showing results is you don't necessarily want your landing page to be too long in my opinion people just aren't going to read all that it just they just really aren't what you want to do is you want to make them feel like the results are endless which i mean at high risk they pretty much are so this is easy for us to do but you want them to make them feel like the results are endless so they just go i'm not going to read all that this thing obviously works that's another really really really useful landing page tool you can use and then when you're showing testimonials results specifically long-winded results take the gist of what the people are saying and put those next to the results okay that's going to help a lot because people aren't going to read this they aren't going to read this this is just proof that what is right here is true so if they want to go prove it they can but most people aren't going to read this okay most people aren't going to read this stuff right here and then finally the last thing i'm going to show you is when people click away from your pages to the thing you want them to do keep it hyper simple you can see when they click this page right here they can't scroll down if they want but it's just pow pow like this is this is the only thing they can do right here there is nothing else there's no other there's no other pages for them to click to there's no terms of service there i mean it's at the bottom of the page of course there's nowhere else from the go same thing with this page right here right this is what i link ads to okay and this is why i keep this page so insanely simple there's nowhere for them to go there's nowhere for them to get lost on this page okay i see people they have like their whole entire website blinks up here like person a person be like oh yeah i do want to know about this guy or like hey i do want to like uh see pricing and whatnot no when you have a funnel there should be no escape from the funnel okay except the place you want them to go there's nowhere for you to go on this except here and there's nowhere for you to go on this page except here okay and uh those are the tips i'm going to give you for the day if you guys want more tips leave some questions in the

TITLE: What I Learned Generating 10 Mil With FB ADs
VIDEO ID: WAlACPfbI9o
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAlACPfbI9o
================================================================================

in my career i've generated tens of millions of dollars strictly just from facebook ads alone now look i don't want to toot my horn but most of the things people do on facebook ads are counter intuitive counterproductive to actually going and making your ads scale the things i see every single day looking at accounts at highrost which is the fastest growing ad tracking company in the world so i have a little bit insight in what's working and what's not and what i see is a lot of people are doing things that really limit their accounts and if you do what i show you in this video i can almost nearly guarantee you're going to see a 20 to 50 increase in your ads because frankly these things are not that simple it's not like you have to go and rework the entire system and then get albert einstein and elon musk and have them make a baby and then have them come optimize your system without you really just have to go and understand what is going to make facebook move forward and what's going to make it move backwards i'm also sorry about making you picture the baby of elon musk and albert einstein in your head i apologize so that being said that's what we're gonna get into you should also subscribe this channel because i alex becker have nearly a decade's worth of experience over 30 million dollars in sales and advertising alone and i also am the ceo of the fastest-growing ad tracking company in the world iros which gives me even more cool insights so you subscribe because i'm just going to tell you everything i know and everything i see because if you're at scale you're probably going to need to get better attribution which you can get through highros which is guaranteed to increase the roi in your ads by 15 20 or you don't pay no seriously you should check it out after this video but let's get into this okay guys so we're at the white board of truth and justice if you want to know why it's called that it's because there's a lot of truth and justice going on here so if you're an evildoer who lies a lot you should probably you should probably back away from this video it might make your skin burn so look i'm just going to start with the top five things you need to be doing on facebook if you just do these five things you're gonna have a good time so let's just start from the top the number one thing i can tell you about facebook ads or any ads in general but super duper facebook ads just go high ticket what does this mean so what high ticket means is you want to be highly priced for your industry so for example if you're like in the fitness industry 297 to a thousand dollars is high ticket if you're in the b2b uh software industry ten thousand dollars would be high ticket if you're in the info industry or you're selling information courses five thousand dollars would be high ticket you got to really look at your industry overall and see what the higher end products being sold are the ones that are more expensive you don't really have to rack your brain on this i can guarantee there's high ticket products being sold in your face and the deeper you can get towards the high-end spectrum the better now what i mean by high-end is don't just make take your product and be like now it's five thousand dollars i was selling it for a hundred dollars yesterday that means look at the products selling for five thousand dollars in your space the most expensive things selling so for example in sas i'm in sas you can look at something like segment when it originally came out they were selling i think for like ten thousand dollars up front or they sell large business packages if you look at hubspot back in the day the way they really made their ads work really well is they start charging a year up front that's high ticket they found a way to make their product high ticket if you look at some info products out there in info coaching instead of selling a 47 product people sell a more exclusive mastermind for i don't know ten thousand dollars this is what i'm referring to right here and you might even be wondering how can i do this in something like the supplement space it's quite easy you just find a way to package all your products together into a larger upfront sale and you can actually just go out there and actually slap some info marketing or a course on top of it to increase the value even more so for example i believe dr axe was selling all the supplements all together with like a uh gut healing course at the same time for 199 to 297 which is pretty high ticket in the supplement space i've seen people do this all the way up to like 497. why do you want to bend over backwards to do this it's very simple your goal with ads and the best way to make your ads hyper profitable like insanely profitable is to make your goal of your ads to acquire customers at a profit what does this mean so most people's goal of their ads is just to make profit this is bad because it actually slows your business down a whole lot you want to acquire customers first as your main goal while making a profit or breaking even but when you go high ticket you can have the best of both worlds why is this so important why is it so important so the hardest part of a business is getting not sales from ads it is going and getting enough customers in your brand to consistently not need ads if you can make a brand where you have a customer base that repeatably buys you are going to be comically wealthy that is the number one main thing now how can we best acquire customers how can we scale up so we acquire customers as easily as possible easy the ads have to be profitable if you have a if you have an ad for every thousand dollars you spend you make two thousand dollars back while acquiring let's say 100 customers at 10 each you could scale that ad all the way to 20 000 a day in theory and be capturing excuse me if i mess up my math any point in this video 2 000 new customers a day who can then come and spend let's say if each of them spends with you over the rest of the year an additional twenty dollars well you're pumping out forty thousand dollars a day in additional revenue on top of let's say i don't know forty thousand dollars a day of actual revenue coming in at a twenty thousand dollar hard cost this is juicy even if we remove this right here this is juicy see the problem with ads it's really hard where most people get caught up is it's really hard to convert people from cold traffic you're you're going to have some people they're going to buy but most people are not going to buy so the key here is just look at this simple metric right here let's say we have a thousand people come through a funnel and we have a 99 product okay if we have only 10 of people buy this product right here which is the most insane conversion rate ever you're not going to have 10 of people come from a cold funnel and buy ever especially at 99 let's imagine this is an insane super crazy world it's the best funnel ever you're going to make 10 000 for that thousand people that came in but let's imagine to get those thousand people to come in you're paying ten dollars per person which is very reasonable okay very reasonable so let's imagine you run this it costs you ten dollars per lead you get a thousand people in ten percent of those people buy at 99 okay cool so we get 100 sales at 100 bucks got 10 000 bucks whoo awesome that sounds pretty good right except we just literally broke even even with the world's greatest converting funnel so let's imagine we we switch this up a little bit we keep the same exact numbers but we get a thousand people in and we get one percent of them to buy a two thousand dollar product just one percent not great conversion rates okay we get one percent of them buy a two thousand dollar product well we just made twenty thousand dollars in sales and we get one percent of them to buy a two thousand dollar product well we just made uh twenty thousand dollars in sales i'm sorry i'm drawing this very badly but there you go you know one percent of people in the funnel that's ten two thousand dollar we doubled our money while getting the same thousand people into the business that's just why it works and i'm gonna tell you it's way easier to do this than it is to do this because there's gonna be a certain amount of people that come into your funnel that are just really targeted customers and really want to buy so let's say we're selling information on how to improve your businesses facebook ads okay and we could sell a 99 course or we could just go a little bit higher ticket and make a more exclusive uh master course for two thousand dollars it's gonna be impossible to do this it's gonna be extremely easy to do this the same concept applies in almost every niche any niche i've ever seen going high ticket with your ads is a better way then you can sell anything else you want because you have this thousand people in your business that are now targeted customers they know who your brand is they know what you're all about they can buy your other products but more importantly we got these thousand people in for free while making a ten thousand dollar profit that's the big coconut right here and then we can make we can retarget these people right here we can market to them more we can put them on an email list we can do all sorts of things to them and it's going to do this i stress to you i very rarely see businesses crush it with this and i see businesses crush it non-stop doing this so the next lesson i have for you is keep your ads simple and basic when i see people running facebook ads i see all these ones with dramatic videos they have like these cameras flying around and they have all these things going on and the first thing you need to understand when it comes to ads is the most important thing you can ever do with ads is be able to get fast feedback loops because a lot of times even if you go and make the world's best shot ad it's probably not going to work okay most ads fail so investing tons of time in an ad or investing tons of effort into an ad instead of going and getting ads out quickly is actually going to just ruin your chances of having effective ads it's way better to make almost sloppy or simple to make ads that you can quickly put out there and get an answer back very quickly so you can find the answer and message that works because what gets people to buy on facebook and what gets people to go through your ads on facebook is the message and that's really it people want to people are going to react to certain wordings of your proc certain benefits and certain angles and your main goal as a person run ads is to find out that message so let me explain it like this when i started up hi-ros a lot of people think well i just need to make better shot ads or more in-depth ads or talk more in ads no no no no no at hirers i started off with three messages okay i started off with three different messages let's just say folk let's say i'm running a b2b ad in general okay let's say i'm running a b2b ad for roofers first ad focuses on saving money for roofers next one's focuses on making more money the next one focuses on using a special optimization to get them more customers a cheat list or something like that let's say a cheat list okay when i was running a house i had four or five different messages i tested i used the same filming setup the same simple simple videos i'll show you here in a second this message didn't work this message didn't work this message went it's insane okay out of the five messages i used one of them went absolutely nuts and my ad costs plummeted my ab results skyrocketed the ad results did not come from me filming a better video in fact if i'd spent tons of time making in-depth videos and i just committed to those ones i wanted to be able to get that feedback loop fast enough to find out the message in my business that was actually converting people the way i made ads that worked really well was simply by making simple ads that i could produce rapidly that's the most important thing you can see right here look at this ad right here this ad performs super well performed super well let's skip the fluff let's skip the fluff however lowers add costs by as much as 52 while increasing roi period here's how i'm not going to read the rest of it because all there is is a picture of me saying are tracking ai skills your ads are you don't pay this ad right here crushes it it is simply a picture of me taken last year with some simple text and a picture of elon musk with his with ai stamped on his head that took me literally 15 seconds to make and then the headline right here new ai gets customers cheaper learn more okay i took this ad right here is actually very complicated because it took many iterations and micro changes to do but overall to produce the overall ad and then get feedback on those micro changes and optimization took seconds feedback loops are how you improve ads quickly not by going and making complicated ads i guarantee if we just go through my facebook news feed right now extremely well-shot well-filmed ads like this going through look we can talk about all day if there's some benefit to this and i'm sure having slightly more professional ads works really well but this this looks like a tv commercial right here and this doesn't even have subtitles but i guarantee right here it took them so long to make this video right here like there had to be multiple people involved in this we had to get this good crazy camera set up right here all the photography all this stuff going on we don't even know if this is the ad message that works the best we don't even know if this is what converts people we don't even know if what's being said in the video is something that hooks people we got to find that hook and then if you're going to make these complicated videos you're going to make more complicated more professional ads get your message first split test ugly simple ads they'll come kingdom comes find the one that gets you to absolute lowest lowest conversion rates or lowest cost of acquisition rates and then make the professional video i can almost guarantee you that the professional video will do worse i've had powerpoint presentation ads destroy well-shot will optimize well beautiful ads that i've made okay so take that to heart next thing with your ads this is where everybody dies in facebook this is where literally every single person dies in facebook there's two markets you can only get into all right so let's say you're in the space for teaching real estate agents to get more clients there's only two markets you can focus on that will work and allow you to scale let's say we're in real estate teaching people to get more clients you can either focus on people who are absolute beginners aka they've never even thought of making real estate uh their their business they've never thought of getting in the real estate and actually becoming a real estate agent okay or you sell the people that are already making let's say 50 000 a year from real estate what most people do in facebook is they try to market to both these audiences at once this is the biggest single mistake on facebook ads everyone does this and then they can't get on the youtube ads because youtube ads punishes this 10 times when facebook does see what facebook does when you first get into is most people try to market to both at once so they're gonna make a course that can help beginners start their first real estate business but also is designed for existing real estate agents who are already making money this works on facebook to a certain extent because at low scale you can really target both these people right here and the market and the targeting on facebook is forgiving enough to let you get away from this but the second you start to say scale what happens is you go into a broader market and you start advertising to more people in facebook's optimization is just not nearly as good at this level all right and it doesn't matter there isn't enough people in this this targeting bubble for it to work even if it had the best optimization okay there just isn't enough people for you to go this this far out in scaling for it to bring you enough customers to scale with so what you have to do is you have to make sure you advertise to only one of the spectrum so you can maximize who you're advertising to you can't advertise the two people at once they're in completely different positions it doesn't work and so people do is they do this and they keep trying to scale out and then their ads keep dying this is why ninety percent of people's ads die and they can't scale on facebook and this is why e-commerce businesses have such an easier time scaling on facebook because they never try to market really outside their niche if they're selling something if they're selling a supplement that helps people lower their cholesterol they're only selling to those people that's it maybe men uh 40 to 60 they pick their demographic and they just go in on it the thing with almost every other niche people don't pick a demographic and go in on it if you pick a demographic and go in on it you're going to dominate it and you're actually going to see better rois at low and you might not even have to scale so for example at hiros i only need to spend two thousand three thousand dollars a day to [Music] generate tens tens and tens and tens of thousands of dollars a day i'm not going to get into the exact metrics but it's a lot all right so either make a product for existing real estate agents making money and in your ads do not focus on beginners you can even say this is not for beginners this is for real estate agents making only 50 000 plus a year or say this is for absolute beginners this is for absolute beginners you this is this is the easiest way to make money ever this is a great way to make money you don't even mention real estate in the ad why do you do this because beginners are going to be repulsed by a course that is too in-depth and too focused on real estate up front they're going they're looking for a way to make money quickly they're looking for a way to get started without effort okay so they're going to gravitate towards something that's super beginner oriented and start for someone who's just looking to start their first business ever that's what they're going to gravitate to they're not going to want to buy a course that's even sort of made for a real estate agent can be like i'm not in real estate i have all these pre-existing expectations and i've never done it before blah blah blah i'm going to go for this course over here that tells me i can make money starting this new fresh crazy business that's what they're going to go for and then real estate agents are going to be repulsed by any course that even is sort of for beginners why because they are not a beginner why would they buy a course that's sort of for a beginner if i'm buying a set of golf clubs and i'm an expert golfer i'm going to buy expert level golf clubs i'm not going to buy an expert level a golf club that sort of works for beginners and is sort of awesome for experts i'm going to buy something that's tailored for me if i'm a beginner i'm not going to buy expert golf clubs i'm not going to buy middle tier golf clubs i'm going to buy beginner golf clubs so don't be in the middle tier because you can't scale the metal tier okay you can you can stay very low scale and so a very expensive product of super targeted people do very well you can go mega high scale and sell to mass people so for example if you want to take over the golf market guess what 90 80 percent of the golf market i would not be surprised is mostly people who play once a year or are beginners in golf and if you're gonna get the largest chunk of that market you got to make it for the beginner golfer the end and the five percent of the market that is expert level golfers that will spend ten thousand dollars on a pair of clubs they're not gonna buy anything else except those ten thousand dollar club so just make the ten thousand dollar clubs insult them that's how you're gonna make the money on facebook the next thing i'm gonna tell you that is so incredibly important is look at the overall stats so if i go and look at let's just say last 30 days on this okay so i go and look at these stats right here a lot of people are going to go and they're going to look at like this one uh we're once let's just even go like we'll go to like delivery okay and they're going to look at all these stats video engagement they're going to dig through all of these these are all useless these are all useless stats there's only one stat that matters and a few major stats after that that are important and the best way you can make progress in ads is understand this simple concept roi is all that matter matters okay because in context of everything this is it cpc cpm all of this is irrelevant why because you can have a great cpc and a bad roi you can have a great cpm and a bad roi what i look at at ads let's say i'm running a webinar funnel or let's say i'm running a call funnel what i'm going to look at is key metrics this would be cost per lead okay everybody at ops in cost per call and an overall in context of roi if roi is bad none of these matter but you have to understand that let's say cost per call and cpl or cost per opt-in these indicate under a reflection of the other stats okay so look we could have a great cpm but if our cost per call is high it doesn't matter if we have a great cpm and our cost per lead is high doesn't matter what is going to control cpo and cost per click and an inflation roi is going to be the message of the ad so for example we could have an ad that has terrible cost per click but a good cpl and an amazing roi an amazing roi you could also have an ad that has a great cost per click a great cpl and a terrible roi why is this let's imagine i was running an ad in the info marketing space okay and i was selling a ten thousand dollar mastermind well i could have an ad that talks about beginning your first business online and is very very broad and appeals to everybody then i can have an opt-in that appeals to everybody so i can have a great cost per click attract tons of people into the funnel a great cpl tons of people who are really cheap leads and facebook guys are opting in and none of them buy the product okay so what you need to do is you don't want to be looking at cpc or cpm you want to make sure your ad is bringing in the right people which is going to be reflected by your roi and then you want to go and once that roi is there focus on the key metrics right here what i focus on high risk is exclusively the cost per call since i know i'm bringing in the right people at this point so look my cost per call right here is going to then be a reflection of my cpm and my cpc if my ad is doing its job and getting the right people in based on the roi and cost per call then it's naturally going to go down and so then what i try and do while focusing on the message of the ad is lower the cost per call by making the ad and the opt-in or the the funnel better okay that's what i'm going to try and lower i'm never going to try and lower these other stats that i can't control you can't control your cpm and frankly your cpm doesn't matter this is what matters right here focus on the key metrics finally that being said my last tip for you is again get the metrics that actually matter one of the biggest problems with facebook ads i'm going to show you straight up is that the attribution is usually not correct because facebook is wildly inaccurate with its its view view conversions if people skim through an ad okay i skim past this ad right here i look at this for two seconds skin pass facebook is going to give itself credit if you don't have last click only attribution on okay on top of that you have to understand if you have a business as any other traffic sources like look if you have a business that's just exclusively if you have a small e-commerce business for example and you don't have any back-end sales you don't have any other interaction with your business besides the ad and the sale not going to be entirely hard for facebook to track but if you have a business where you have google searches you have ads you have youtube ads running you have an email list you have people just organically interacting with the business on a daily basis coming back and buying more facebook is going to start giving it credit for like literally everything because this prom right here if there's ever a click at any time it's just gonna give itself credit because it doesn't talk to the rest of your business this results in you doing all sorts of goof troopery the biggest thing would be investing in ads that aren't paying off like for example facebook said this one generated two calls it didn't it didn't and what i'm looking at right here is the hi-ros chrome extension which again i can go look at all the very very deep traffic tracking that's in the hirosh dashboard but if i just click here i can go and see exactly who came in and i can see exactly where they clicked and where they came from from i can see everything this person did and i can see all the ads this person clicked on the way there you can see they actually clicked multiple facebook ads came through and then came through our email list and came in this is where they came in at okay click clicked welcome on one of our emails so i can see exactly where this guy came from and i can see that this guy's first click wasn't even on the date that facebook was giving it facebook gave credit right here okay which it did and so of course the credit right here is accurate but this guy right here actually clicked for the first time in 2020 all right almost six months ago so you need to have correct attribution because you're gonna be investing in ads that aren't actually paying off and you're gonna be killing ads that are paying off for example this one right here reported two calls i actually got four calls from okay at this point right here the cp cost per call right here is acceptable for me even at 150 bucks uh at 71 dollars actually but i'm actually getting 35 calls i need to be like quadrupling down on this ad on top of that feeding this data back to facebook is incredibly important i don't do it on this account because it's one of my smaller accounts my bigger accounts that i use for more serious business stuff i feed the data back to facebook and it allows the the ai to optimize much better because again it's missing half the data right here that it should be optimizing for so what i suggest you do get some type of attribution software if you're interested in having that and not wasting money on bad ads and saving a lot more money on ads that aren't actually performing well and increasing ads that are performing well and then combining it with ai optimization to make your ads perform much better overall check out hirose below this video there's no reason to be running any ads at scale without something like high risk and again we guarantee that you're going to see a 15 to 20 minimum increase in your ads or you don't pay for it so check it out when the video's done maybe and really guys that's that's the video for today if you do those five things that most people don't do it's so simple those things that broke down most people just don't do those and it's why they are wasting so much money and time on facebook ads they're spending so much time in their dashboard and playing with all these irrelevant stats and going to agencies and all these things when it's really quite simple if you just nail the things that actually matter that being said guys subscribe to the channel i'm releasing three videos like this week going forward to covering youtube ads funnels everything if you're in the ads for your business and want to make more money from your ads i'm just going to tell you how to do it and i know how to do it if you want a little bit more something if you want a little bit if you want something a little bit more on death check out my iron mastermind below this video i have more results when it comes to ads than any other ad mastermind that's being offered

TITLE: ULTIMATE Facebook Video Ad BLUEPRINT
VIDEO ID: VwPznbPTp7Y
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwPznbPTp7Y
================================================================================

most people are terrible at facebook video ads they just are it's not an insult it's not a dig it's just not these aren't going to convert guys what i'm going to show in this video is exactly what will make your videos convert much higher this is in terms of clicks but this is also in terms of people landing on the page in a much more likely to buy state okay if you understand how to start videos with the same the middle videos the proper length and how the format the colors the text all these little things that are actually really important on where the eye lands in the video you're going to get such better results from your ads okay so why am i telling you this well straight up i'm the ceo of hiros it's the fastest growing ad attribution company in the world because um we basically guarantee results people consistently at least see a 15 20 increase in their ad roi from our a optimization and print tracking or they don't pay but what that gives me is a little special insight on how our industry works and evolves and i'll never share anyone's data i will show you the trends in industry and what i've learned from growing two businesses to eight figures almost exclusively from ads so that being said let's hop in the value because i'm going to show you exactly how to make your videos convert so much higher if you just do this it's simple it's easy and it could actually go and increase your business significantly because if you get more clicks at a cheaper cost that's going to give you cheaper conversions and more of them that can be a big result if you get like a 20 50 more increase from that and it's quite simple to do if you just listen to this let's get into it okay guys so like always i'm just going to get into this i'm really going to be comparing ads that i just don't think are optimal to my ads that have performed very optimally okay again i'm not taking digs at these businesses i'm not here to i'm not here to smack them or anything like that i just from my experience seeing tons of ads working at hiros these aren't optimal so let's just get started with the most important thing when it comes to video ads judging your video ads performance what most people get lost in is they look at the cost per view and the cost per click this is pretty irrelevant are these things relevant in the in a micro scale yes but the only thing that really matters is your cost per acquisition and then overall your revenue you have to understand that i could get an amazingly low cost per view on my video ads if i just put a cat on it and just rambled and made the cat do cute things i could go and get very low cost per clicks if i say click here and you'll get free things this doesn't mean the ads can perform well you need to understand that your goal with that is to attract your target customer and if you're really attracting your target customer sometimes your cost per viewing cost per click will be expensive what is important is that you attract people and put them in a state of mind to perform well on your landing page that is going to be reflected in your cost per acquisition whether it's cost per call cost per lead or short-term cost per sale that's super important to understand because if you send the wrong people to the page cheaply you're going to have a very high cost per acquisition so what i'm going to tell you straight up is a lot of people are going to disagree with us i don't care don't pay attention to your cost per click or cost per view it's irrelevant what you need to be paying to is cost per acquisition and more so cost or total revenue back in okay which is again why you should be using hiros because you can see facebook is missing calls all the time right here i would not have the right it's over reporting and some of them under reporting and it's not catching my call conversion so i can see calls that converted a week after to click and actually get my true roi this is what i judge my ads by and the reason for that is because if you were attracting the wrong people you're not going to get the actual results that matter okay and you can spend all day optimizing your cost per viewing cost per click this right here gets the right person to my page and then i'm able to look at the revenue numbers and actually judge it as a good ad by the cost per call and the revenue generated okay so again do those things now here's the most important thing with video ads there needs to be something to entice the person to watch them i this this is so straightforward we look at this ad right here design pickle it starts the video off the thumbnails i'm sitting around with garyvee and you really can't even recognize garyvee if we're scrolling through this ad right here like this we're not gonna recognize garyvee and frankly that's irrelevant because i'm not gonna buy something because they're sitting down with garyvee this doesn't tell me what the proc does for me doesn't tell me why i should be interested look at this ad right here the most important thing first off is i'm using all the tactics from the last video to draw the eye in on the purple stick people want to know what's on this stick they go what's on the stick that's that's exactly why i'm doing this create a question that gets a person to look at that present the benefit of watching the ad our tracking ai will scale your ads or you don't pay let's talk about this headline real quick ai is a buzzword that gets people interested they make something it's something new cutting edge that they're missing out on something we'll scale your ads you don't pay a person that run ads is gonna go wait buzzword guaranteed results explain lower ion buzzword slash interesting context subject guaranteed result that they're super interested in this lures people in like that okay so we go and look at a lot of these ads right here we can look at like i'm not i'm not here to pick on wiki reports we do enough of that at high rows but if we look at wicker reports right here you start the video you don't know what are we what are we watching right here why what what is the benefit to watching this video behind the scenes with clickfunnels and it's it's already it's a tiny text right here what's the benefit click funnels trust wiki reports what what is the benefit to a person running ads i don't even know this is a company that tracks ads we just see a guy sitting here talking so all right whatever uh we go down and actually look at some other ads right here let's go look at some i i believe i saw a good one right here okay so video starts off it's muted of course we don't where is the thing that hooks the viewer in tells them the benefit they're watching okay ppp performance framework not for beginners this doesn't tell me the benefit if you look at this ad right here our tracking ai hooks you in buzzword blue stick guaranteed result hooks them in like that now another thing you're not going to see on ads like for example we saw like the wiki reports ad they don't have they didn't have subtitles people you literally can't get people to click your ads so what makes you think they're actually going here and turn on the sound while they're on their phone like you see someone in an airport being like just skimming through facebook and being like oh yeah you know what i want to hear right now a bunch of noise no they don't do that that's why you need to use something like veed not the facebook caption manager because it doesn't always show up to just slap the subtitles and really big well-positioned clean text that people can read because people most of the time aren't going to turn on sound on your ad okay so that's the next thing now first five seconds if you run ads this ai tracking script will scale your ads at least 20 further and get you customers as much as 52 cheaper i guarantee it what's what's the benefit i'm offering what is this ad about what are people going to get and what is the big gain they're going to achieve if they click this ad it's all explained in the first if you're a person that runs ads and cares about making more money this video has your attention at this point at this point all i'm doing in this video ad is that first eight seconds focus on who is your target customer what are they most interested in and how can you make it extremely enticing to continue to watch the video the way i do it in this one i say this stuff is going to get you this result this result in a new cutting-edge way i guarantee it it's like whoa all right this is new and cutting edge and he guarantees that house is going to go down a lot of people start their ads with rambling or they're walking around their house get to the point and tell people what they're going to gain okay what they're going to see so for example when i was doing an info ad info ads in the past i said the next 45 seconds i'm going to show you how we made 45 000 selling this wolf mug okay for my youtube mastermind ads okay that i'll run i'm gonna say this ad right here this powerpoint presentation did two million dollars in sales i'm going to show you exactly the ad targeting that i used on youtube what's the person getting in the first five seconds there you go that hooks them they want to see the rest of it so at this point right here i just follow a really simple pattern that's really covered in our youtube uh ad script is also on this channel as well and i want to really express one thing to you guys this first five seconds and the things we just covered is 90 of the battle all right most people are not going to watch past the first 10 seconds now now that we're into the first 10 seconds customers as much as 52 cheaper i guarantee it no literally guarantee this is called hyrus and if it doesn't get you those results you don't pay for it and that's why so that there's a huge hook right here so the the thing i like to do is i like to present a huge hook and explain the benefit behind it okay especially on facebook where we only have about 60 seconds we don't need a five-minute ad on facebook you want a 60-second ad okay then what i do is i back it up i back up the big crazy challenge so i make a big challenge statement then i back it up big brands like clickfunnels.com tombylow's impact theory dot com ingrazios and tonyrom's mastermind dot com six seven eight and nine figure ecommerce brands like ladyboss.com those and ads leaders you get it so i back it up and this way the way in this video i back it up is i just show the brands that are using hyrus in my info ads i show the results of our customers and people talking about it and then mentioning the product all right all right show our results on there so i back it up with proof like dan henry and even one of the highest revenue click funnels funnels of all time alex marsey's gymlodge.com they all use this too and so do hundreds of other businesses and frankly if you're not using it too you're at a massive disadvantage because frankly you're paying way too much to get a customer then after i back it up i induce fear and fomo you can see i did exactly right there this thing does incredible things here's proof that it does here's proof here's the fact the the sad truth that you're missing out who all right this thing is amazing everybody else is using it you're not using it that gets people hooked in there okay and then when i do at the end of this at the end of every video it's very simple very simple close i don't have time to explain it all here i will break down everything in extreme detail and give you every aspect of how it works if you click this ad same thing with info ads look i just showed you that this concept right here is making people a ton of money here's a ton of money people that made a ton of money doing it look they're all making money and you're missing on this thing that is just sitting right here it's a huge opportunity i can't explain it all in a 60-second video of course so click this ad and i'll show you exactly how it works we'll give you a template on how to do it we'll give you the scripts we'll give the yada yada so we wrap it up with a call to action to get something laid out extremely easy whatever because when you use print tracking plus ai optimization you pay much less you can scale much further you get customers cheaper you can bid more competitively and if you click this ad i'll explain in extreme detail how it all works and we will even set this up for you and we will also guarantee the results i've talked about that's it that's how simple a facebook ad can be you can see how easy it is hook them back it up create fomo call to action people don't watch five minute facebook i've never watched a video on facebook have you have you i don't i mean if i'm watching videos i'm on youtube i don't i don't ever sit around and watch videos on facebook like ever because the way facebook is set up is so unoptimal for watching videos it's meant to keep you scrolling they don't want you watching videos the more you scroll the more ads you see so it's not set to get you watching a video youtube wants you to watch videos because the more videos you watch the more ads you see it wants you to skip from video to video to video facebook wants you to scroll okay it wants you to spend as little time as possible on there so the site isn't designed to get you to watch videos so what do you do keep the video short hit hard use those subtitles make sure to hook the person with a with an appropriate headline in the video itself this is your biggest headline space in the entire ad use it use it do not have an ad that just says nothing do not start your ads off in a vague way okay and for the love of holy monkey holy moliness make it abundantly clear who you're at is for what the benefit is and abundantly clear what they're going to get for watching the ad okay like almost every ad we've skimmed through you like what is this what does this ad actually do make your ads stand what are we getting right here hey let's keep going through these ads right here okay i love magics strong roi and free to try this is much better okay uh magix is one of the people we actually kind of partner with with our integrations so look they're literally going for this is a great ad this is a great ad actually you know um i was worried i was gonna have to poop on magics for a second here's another one right old way to plan marketing from a new this doesn't this doesn't if someone builds funnels what does the old way versus the new way have to do with them [Music] what is the benefit of what we're seeing right here how's this so this stuff right here guys is just really chronic when it comes to facebook if you don't do this the right way you're going to be looking at weird metrics like cost per view and cost per click and you're not going to be getting the most important thing which is the cost per acquisition for sale at the levels you want to be so this has worked abundantly well for me it's so simple it makes it easy to make ads very quickly high level produce and i think you should use it so that being said guys if you're interested in increasing use if you're not tracking your revenue and your inspiration accurately you're not spending your money that's simple that if you want to help scaling your hands my headmaster has more results literally guaranteed if you don't see and i'll see you in the next video you

TITLE: These Images BLOW UP Facebook Ad Conversions
VIDEO ID: KcKuSvE5oNo

================================================================================

what i'm about to show you this is like basically using sugar to attract ants if you apply what i'm going to show you to your images on facebook ads even on your youtube videos whatever you're doing you're going to get significantly more clicks you're going to attract more people and it's just that simple this is the complete basics but nobody knows this nobody uses this but the basics of getting the human eye to pay attention to something and then making the human brain go i'm interested in finding out more about this something if you follow this very simple pattern that every single top youtuber uses and apply it to ads you're gonna get more clicks you're gonna get cheaper clicks you're gonna get more of your target audience paying attention to your ad you're gonna get the people that you want to click your ad to click your ad i cannot make it any more simple and the reason why i know this i've grown multiple businesses to eight figures exclusively using ads i'm the ceo of hirose which means i see the data across the entire ad industry i see what's working and i've worked and have the highest six seven and eight figure result ratio of my ad mastermind of any ad mastermind online meaning i work with tons of other that are running tons of ads and i see exactly what's working i see what doesn't work what i'm going to show you in this video is exactly what works by the way if you want to check out that mastermind get some coaching on your ads and scale as well there's a link below but first let me show you exactly how this works so let's just dive into this because frankly this is probably going to be one of the most important marketing lessons you ever learn because it's simple and it applies to virtually anything whether you're making youtube video thumbnails whether you're making facebook ad thumbnails whether you're trying to get a person's attention you need to understand how the human eye works what it's going to think and how it behaves so look when you're making images for your ads specifically but this can apply to anything you need to understand a few simple basic concepts when a person is skimming through something you need to understand that i must focus on one thing and so the focus of an image must be on one thing and what you need to have happen is the way image should work is the first thing that should happen is there needs to be something centralized that grabs the person's main attention and then there needs to be something that creates a question maybe it could be the image itself which simply is happening in the the image alone but usually it's going to be something side or beside the image that's going to create that significant question it makes them go what is going on here i'm interested okay that is the most important thing when making an image for an ad and then what you're going to get them to do when you're making an ad is then interact and understand what they're clicking on or what they're going for with the headlines or maybe the headlines that you'll start playing in the video of the ad as well see what a lot of people do with their images is they try to fit the entire message into the image at once so they'll have like a picture of themselves and they'll have some headline here and then they'll have some other image right here and there's so many things going on this doesn't pull the eye into anything and it makes it very easy to scroll past and very easy to ignore and some examples of this would be like this ad right here now there's all sorts of bad things going on with this headline right here but there's just a zillion different things happening we've got this pink thing right here we got this guy standing right here we got a headline right here nothing particularly creates a question of what's happening here what's going on and most importantly there's nothing for the eye to settle on so you're just going to scroll right past this thing okay we can keep going and looking at other images right here okay we got we got yoda right here it's a very bland there's nothing here that creates a what's going on here you know immediately this is an ad it doesn't perk your interest and there's nothing no main benefit or anything to really call out to the person right here now let's look at basically the master of doing this it's it's mr beast so if you go look at any of his videos what's happening in all these images right here let's not even look at the headline yet we have a picture of him right here in a coffin very bright you can notice that everything is extremely bright in the image why because this captures a person's attention bright things attract the eye you can notice really bright colors in every single and that's one huge takeaway right there now the next thing you really want to focus on when you're looking at this is look at how there's one central thing going on in the image or something to pull your eye in each time at least in the the best performing ones right here you can see this one right here boom right in the center of the screen boom one key image that's going on right here so you see him eating this golden ice cream it makes you wonder what's going on you got him in this stack of stuff none of these images right there describe exactly what's happening in the video you need to look at that it's very important none of these describe what's happening in the video and so when you see people putting giant headlines and all these things in here these headlines aren't doing anything to create a question they aren't doing anything uh to create interest and the whole point of an image when you're using it on facebook or on youtube it doesn't matter is to create that interest to get a person to read the headline and then want to see what's happening next so check out some of my images on my youtube channel okay you can see like this one right here this video did very very very well why why don't why do my videos consistently do very well well because the images create interest you see you see me right here with bitcoin on my eyes saying oh my god creates interest what's going on here all right you can see a picture of me right here with sunglasses on i have a picture of ada the cryptocurrency and i have really bad above it what's going on here that's the point of the image is to get a person go what's going on it's not to convince the person to click or to sell to them okay and so when you're doing this on facebook it's extremely important then to have a very powerful benefit in the headline and the text because that's what you're going to get people to do okay let's look at a few of my image ads pay attention to this because this is super important when you're running video ads it's very important your thumbnail has these qualities okay that has these qualities you can see this right here this isn't particularly a great image a really good example of a great image on ads is going to be this one right here all right so you see me holding this little stick it's the same exact concept that you see in the beast videos the same exact concept you see in my youtube videos but what i'm going to try and do here on facebook ads is just slightly bit different as i always try to use a key focal point to draw people in this ad just absolutely dominates it's because of this thumbnail okay and so then the best way i find to make ads work on facebook because people aren't you're not you're not doing content all right you're not going to do something as interesting as burying yourself for an entire day right we're not doing cat videos here we need to get people to pay attention to the image by having the central point right here you can even see if we want to get down to the colors we have an extremely different color so if i want to make this image really stick out i would probably have my a white background me blurred out in an extreme focus on the thumbnail on the uh the thumb drive right here and make it a very very strong bright blue that would get the most interaction by far on the ad because the central point is right here and everything else is blurred out and not being no attention is being dragged from the eye to it so what i like to do is i don't want to have uh you don't ever want your headlines to be suggestive or broad if you're going to do them in your images what you want to have is a headline that creates a question or a challenge okay are tracking ai will scale your ads or you don't pay and that by the way that's the case at high risk literally if our ai tracking optimization does not scale your ads you don't pay okay and frankly with ios 14.5 out people's tracking not working accurately if you're running ads without high risk you're an insane person because you're not able to attribute correctly when you're not able to attribute correctly you can't scale as well you waste a ton of money and the ai optimization on facebook and google is a mess so you should check out hiros below if you get a chance we literally guarantee you'll see a 15 to 20 increase in your ads that being said you can see what i'm doing right here is i'm using this challenge to get the person to click because this is highly incentivizing to this is something they badly want look on youtube what a person badly wants is to be entertained all right and have their adhd influenced so that's why i'm not going and making challenges or or hooks or putting crazy things in the thumbnails because frankly when people are skimming through thumbnails on youtube we really need their eye to settle and then i use this right here i used it i used the challenge of entertainment why cardano will 10x and kill e this is this is a challenge it's the same exact thing okay so the reason why i put headlines in thumbnails on facebook is because in order to really lure in our target audience our target our target person we're not trying to get everyone to click this is the big important distinction on youtube i want everyone to click so i'm going to use something kind of broad and anonymous because i want as many views as i can possibly get okay our goal on facebook is to draw the person in with the image and then get our target prey to click with a very targeted challenge right so what i do right here is our tracking a will scale your ads or you don't pay this is a crazy challenge right here it's going to create a massive amount of interest for a very particular type of person okay but we don't want we don't want to take this broad approach that we use on youtube over to facebook so move faster build better what does that mean build a start a free trial because what's going to happen is when people see an ad what's they're going to do is they're going to notice it they're going to get their eye draw into it they're going to notice it's an ad so you better make some strong case because the only time a person will click an ad is they know they're not about to be entertained so you're not going to lure them in with some viral nova viral content ploy right there you might as well throw that out the window at that point we don't want everybody clicking we want to attract everyone's attention and then get a specific person to click okay because the best way to attract that specific person to click is to tap onto them like you can any other human being okay by using the same concepts that mr beast uses and his thumbnails that really popular youtubers use then once you have everyone's attention you want to sort out everybody by making a very clear benefit-driven challenge get started free is not a benefit-driven challenge give technologists a better way to build up skills is not a specific challenge this is not going to interest anybody and the cost per click and the people that you have coming through there's nothing that's being delivered here so what you want to do is you use this simplicity to draw on the eye you can maybe add something else that creates a little bit of interest then what we're going to do is we can add a very specific headline in the top right here to lay out the benefit that they're going to get especially when a video is playing and feeds you want to have this right here to remind people what the challenge and benefit of watching is and if you've drawn in your target audience using this method you then need to find a way to keep them and that's the way you do it with this challenge right here saying be the yoda of ads or get a free trial this is not going to lure and keep them okay the same exact thing goes with the headline the same exact thing goes with the text okay if you go and look at the text on my ads using p tracking and ai to optimize to get customer cheaper lets you scale yours let me show you the results it's just a straight up challenge these are the results you're going to see because the only reason people want to buy stuff they want to click as is results see tracking results how we hyper skill ads with data plus ai one thing i'm also doing right here is i'm not completely describing what we do as a company why because i need to create that interest to get the click the result is they're going to scale easier and make more money but i want to also be a little bit mysterious about how we get there i'm using again the same concept kind of as the beast videos or you see on my channel where i'm not completely explaining how we're going to do it but i'm explaining the result all right cardano will kill ethereum is the result that's what people are interested in but they want to know how it's going to work so if i say ethereum will kill eth because the scaling solutions are better it's going to fall apart because people know what the video is about if i just say it's going to kill it completely different thing okay so take these lessons to heart it's a very simple lesson that i have for you today that that's literally it if you can apply this you're going to see such better results with your ads your youtube videos literally anything you do that involves images and catching people's attention online now if you want more training like this or you'd like to actually see exactly how i've skilled multiple businesses to eight figures on youtube ads almost exclusively you should go below and just book a call with me i'll help you with your ads and give you a skilling strategy now that also being said just some shameless thought now that also being said just some shameless showing real quick look if you run ads you really should just be using hiros you need to have proper attribution you need to be able to make the right decisions by picking the ads that are actually scaling and actually pick the ads that are losing money and you can feed that data back to ai you should just check it out because we literally guarantee a 15 to 20 increase in your ad roi and this is why it's gonna allow you to scale so much further for example if you just go look at my simple call funnel right here i actually had 30 calls booked google caught 20. if you look at my call funnel right here i had 10 calls booked google caught four one caught four caught this right here would mean me turning off these ads and making a lot less money i can even click this and see every single person that click this ad i can go click and see their entire click history everything they did like tracking people up for years if you're not using this you're making bad decisions through ads you're losing money you're not scaling effectively you're wasting money and you're passing bad data ai book a call below on top of that if you want to see how i've scaled multiple businesses to eight figures hi-ros and my last info business if you want to see the exact strategies i do with ads you want to see exactly how to scale your business with ads a lot more efficiently book a call with me below my iron ad mastermind has more seven and eight figure results than any youtube ad or ad mastermind online right now you should check it out both of these have 90 day refund guarantees so if they don't work for you you don't pay for them because

least twice a week aiming for three times a week that's all i'll see you next time [Music] you

TITLE: NEW!!! #1 FACEBOOK AD METRIC [JUST BLEW UP MY GAINS]
VIDEO ID: U2-gK4xvTKQ
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2-gK4xvTKQ
================================================================================

you're about to see the one metric to rule them all in fact if you just alter this metric in your facebook ad account and ignore everything else you are going to see plummeting ad costs and much much higher rois on your ads no hyperbole this works nearly every single time i do it any person i show it to it works for them as well and this right here is perfect for you if you look at your ad accounts and you see all the stats like cpc and cpm and bpm and rpg as well as dps you got to have high dps in your your facebook accounts okay that way you can get sweet loot by killing the raid bosses the nerds got that joke anyways you probably look at all the stats in your ad managers and you're like whoa cpc went up or a cpm went up and i don't know what's going on and everything skyrocketed or went this way this this is the fix to all of that and will allow you to get your cpc cpm everything at dirt cheap levels and it will just be easy for you to do so instead of talking this up anymore let me just show you and by the way hit the like button hit the notification bell and subscribe i release these videos every monday wednesday and friday and on this ad channel unlike other ad channels i don't teach you one fourth of what i do and then sell you a course i have no course to sell you i want you to grow your business and make more money so that you buy hiros my ad tracking company do make you more money and the best way for me to get you to buy hiros so you can make more money with hiros is simply just give you everything i know because then you'll buy highers and even upgrade your account because you're making so much more money from the attackers i give you like this one right here okay guys let's just get going and i guarantee again if you apply what i'm going to show you in this video you're going to see such better metrics and get all the things you're looking to achieve cheaper clicks cheaper cpms dramatically reduce your ad costs this works nearly every single time and that's not me being hyperbolic when i help people in my mastermind do this and they stop thinking like i'm about to show you it nearly always works so let me show you what i'm talking about right here what i'm looking at right here is usually the number one sign that a media buyer is about to get really really lost don't get me wrong this is actually a spreadsheet that i'm pretty sure this media buyer captured from one of my friends sam evans now sam evans and his team are like literal data scientists so this stuff can actually work for them i never use it but i i know it's helped him the thing is what most people do when they're buying facebook ads is for example sam's business which uses this is like a 20 million dollar per year business people that are making a hundred thousand two hundred thousand less than a million dollars a year even less than five million dollars per year they'll go in and they'll start adopting this type of data scientist strategy and what happens is they end up trying to control all these little metrics right here and i want to tell you something about these metrics you can't control any of them directly your cpc is controlled by facebook your your ad spend your impressions your cpm these are all these are all indicators of something else that is you can't actually control for example if you want to control the speed you're going on your car you don't look at the mile per hour you don't look at the rpms you don't look at the battery you just look at your gas pedal and you press down and the thing you need to focus on if you want to make the car go faster is not the readings aka the mile per hour the rpms etc you want to actually focus on how hard you're pressing down on the gas pedal i know that doesn't make much sense so let me explain this if you look at my ads i've clearly identified the gas pedal and that is going to be my cpl my cost per call and my roi if you go and look at my ad accounts the only columns i really ever have showing are these things i will occasionally look at these stats that i'm mentioning right here when something has gone terribly wrong but these stats still don't help i usually use this to look for glitches or something that's broken okay for example if my cpc skyrockets or something like that i i haven't literally looked at these things though in years so again i don't even want to use that example but why alex why do you only look at these things shouldn't you be looking at all these things and trying to micro bid and optimize here's what you need to understand let's just look at a simple metric like cpl now you have to break down what actually leads to your key metrics and then what actually controls things like cpa cpc and cpm there's all sorts of other crazy stats that people look at i'm just going to focus on those two because they're just the easiest to explain okay and if you're new cpc is cost per click cpm is the cost for how many 1 000 impressions you're getting so if facebook shows your ad to a thousand people and you pay 21 dollars for that that's your cpm but you have to understand cpl is a reflection of metrics that are then also reflections of your cpc and cpm so cpl is the top level metric and by focusing on that the thing that controls your cpl is actually going to be your ad click-through rate your ad engagement and going to be your opt-in rate at that point all right there's many other ones out there but for example your ad click-through rate is going to be controlled and your ad engagement is going to be controlled by two things actually one thing how engaging your damn ad is okay and these two things are first off how many people watch your ad and how many people click your ad you're probably thinking no duh obviously alex but what you need to understand right here is that if you want to get a low cpl what we're going to focus on instead is not going and altering the ad click-through rate and the engagement we're going to focus on lowering the cpl by focusing on the thing that controls all this the ad itself okay we don't ever i don't ever look at these metrics right here what i'm gonna look at is i'm gonna go upload an ad and i'm gonna look at which one gets the lowest cpl uh across the same opt-in page now follow along with me right here if the cpl is lower automatically that means the ad click-through rate and ad engagement are better every single time because i know that in the sub of this an ad that has a high ad click-through rate and a high ad engagement also has a lower cpc and thus because of the engagement has a lower cpm but again i'm not looking at these right here i'm going to only look at the cpl because again the cpl is a symptom of these things and these things are a symptom of these things and so what you can do is you can cut out all of these charts right here you can cut out all this excessive data that's going to confuse you and lead you to an action you can just focus on one metric the cpl because as you focus on the cpl let's imagine we haven't optimized the opt-in page or our sales page uh or the shopify e-com landing page the landing on or the call funnel okay let's imagine we haven't optimized that yet your cpl is naturally going to tell you the ad that has the best ad click-through rate and the best engagement and thus the best cpc and cpm and by focusing only on cpl you're moving all these things in the direction you want to anyways so instead of that i'm going to upload five ads and i'm just going to look purely at the cpl don't move the cpl i can guarantee you 99 is going to have the best metrics that's it and so then what i'm going to do to reduce cpl is focus on the overall thing which is the ad itself and the ad itself is actually controlled by how many people watch it and how it speaks to them and so i'm going to focus on the ad message not the metrics at all i'm going to focus on what message i see so if i have five ads and they all five say something a little bit different i'm gonna look at the one that gets the best cpl thus gets the best of these things i'm not gonna repeat them anymore and then what i'm gonna say is oh that message is what people respond to and then i'm gonna make five more ads around that message and then see which one of those ones people respond to the most and say oh okay this message out of the five out of this message gets the most powerful response and that's how i'm gonna go out there so instead of actually even focusing on the cpl i focus on the add message and this is how you drive all these to the floor then what i'm going to do is i'm going to go and apply this add message to the opt-in and then try five or six different opt-ins that have a different version of this message right here and so then i'm gonna get the opt-in right so let's imagine right here we started off with a cpl of let's say 15 okay and this 15 cpl is actually your ad click-through rate engagement all these things right here contributing to this so what i'm going to do first is i'm going to focus on the add messages and get this cpl down to let's say nine dollars by focusing only on the ad message not the opt-in page yet if the opt-in page let's imagine it has a 10 opt-in rate right here all right a 10 conversion rate 10 something okay whatever we're trying to do get calls or whatnot so i'm going to use purely my ad messaging and using the cpl to tell me which ad is the best message ignoring these other stats so once i get this down to nine dollars or i'm gonna say all right that looks really good now what i'm going to do is i'm going to try and get this opt-in up to 30 or 40 percent or increase my conversion rates on the page by uh three to four x which is very very very doable on your first version of anything your first version is usually going to have so much room to be optimized to again just look at the cpl and i'm going to try and get this cpl down to three dollars by purely focusing on the opt-in and that right there is going to in turn make my business significantly more profitable if i take my cpl from fifteen dollars or my cost per any acquisition i'm looking for from fifteen dollars to three dollars my business just 5xed in profitability ish all right and i'm off if i'm off a little bit there just because i don't do math in these videos that's not my strong suit getting ad messages is this right here is by far the best way to improve your ads versus this excessive over analyzation this is something that your mind can understand right here i can easily focus on cpl and i can easily focus on the message of the ad i can control that and think about it super clearly i cannot look at this chart and make clear simple decisions and this is what most media buyers do they they come to this and they try to they try to do it like the stock market okay we look at all these metrics and whatnot uh all the billion things that are going on try to make a call but the thing is the stock market is not under your control the cryptocurrency market is not under your control so you need to sometimes do all this over analyzation okay in theory i guess your ads are literally under your control so you don't need to do this you can literally just go in and focus on one key metric now the last thing i want to focus on is i always like to look at the upfront metrics so that's going to be your cost per call cost per uh lead cost per call is cpc that i'm referring to right here or cop cpa so cost per sale or something if you're doing ecom okay but these aren't always the best thing to look at especially cost per call and cost per lead because the main thing is actually roi we want to get these things as low as possible to tell us to to basically control the add metrics so these things right here are going to control all these metrics that we're looking at right here okay they're going to be symptoms of all these metrics at least the roi at the end of the day though is the number one most important thing and i want to show you this by looking at the stats right here from just hiros and google ads okay you can see right here the cost per call on these right here is actually really good this one is great 49 cost per call i can come in verify look at the stats and hire see exactly who's booking calls and who's coming in so the cost of a call is looking amazing on both of these actually 200 cost per call is amazing but you can see if i optimize for cost per call this is a weird instance right here where the cost recall also lines up with the profit but you can see that these calls right here didn't generate me a profit these ones did this is actually tracking that's impossible to do in google ads because these are being closed over the phone and i'm tracking this with hiros again i hate to show highrose in these videos actually i don't it will just improve your business immensely and the point of these videos is to help your business so much that you're eventually going to be like hmm i'd like to improve it more with hiros we literally guarantee you'll get these results and be able to grow your ads you don't pay for it so i have no problem showing it to you because frankly it just works but tying into this lesson right here if you are optimizing just around cpl or cpc and not around profits what happens all the time is people look at everything except their profits and then what they do is they go and scale up ads they're actually unprofitable in roi terms but they look amazing in cpl and cpc this is chronic so don't do that as well this is a lesson for today guys to wrap it all up what you want to do is you want to understand that your cpl or your main metrics are symptoms of all these other metrics but if you focus on the symptom it's not like the doctor's office right here which is usually going to then be controlled by your ad messaging and then your landing page we want to focus on the messaging first because the landing page can artificially drive this up and down focus on the messaging first because that will then control this and this will just control every other stat okay or will we be a reflection of every other stat and if we just keep our minds simple focus on the ad message to lower cpl this will lower everything else and then once we've lowered cpl enough without focusing on the landing page or funnel then we focus on the landing page and funnel to lower it even more to get our ads to massive profitability this is the best way to do this and my iron mastermind whenever students stop doing this okay and again i'm not hating on this for example my friend sam evans i massive respect for him he's a genius i have not seen this work for many of people it might work for people in his mastermind or whatnot i usually see people get way better results in my mastermind by doing this okay so it depends on who you are and maybe what you want to look at but nine out of 10 times simplifying everything to a point where your mind can easily get it is going to deliver better results for you speaking of which check out the links in the description right here you could book a call with me you can literally see the results i've gotten six seven and eight figure results by moving their business to youtube and improving their facebook ads you can go check that out book a call with me i'll tell you exactly how to do it for your business as well you could even join the mastermind if you're a good fit that being said in these videos this is the lesson for today i share everything i know in these videos because frankly i want you to grow your business to the point where you need highrose so i don't hold anything back i don't have anything subtle to sell you here and that's why you should subscribe because i release videos like this every monday wednesday and friday and you'll see them when they go live and it'll be super cool because again this is the only channel where i'm just gonna tell you everything i do instead of telling you like three fourths of what i do or one-fifth of what i do and then selling you a course i don't have a course to sell you i just want your business to grow so you buy hyrus so subscribe and i'll see in the next video [Music] you

TITLE: HANDS DOWN!! THE BEST AD TRAFFIC SOURCE OF 2021 [I Can't Believe It]
VIDEO ID: XjJvuEEM7fA
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjJvuEEM7fA
================================================================================

this is by far going to be the best traffic source for you in 2021 hands down everybody who does what i'm gonna tell you in this video makes significantly more money i'm not exaggerating this is not hyperbole i i could literally show you hundreds of testimonials of people doing this and making significantly more money from this traffic source if you understand what i'm going to show you in this video and you apply this to your ads i this is how i've generated multiple eight figures in sales at my info business this is how i've scaled iros to being the fastest growing ad tracking company in the world right now if you just use this traffic source and this type of mindset towards this traffic source you're gonna kill it now let's back up okay you're like whoa tai lopez calm down with those income claims okay i know everybody all the time is like this is the best traffic source that's ever just oh i get it i get it but what i'm gonna show you in this video is back by data it's backed by results and i've tested this multiple multiple multiple multiple times and it just consistently works and i have absolutely no incentive to show you this other than the fact that i need you to make more money from your ads because if you make more money from your ads you're going to pick up hi-ros because ad tracking is absolutely essential especially after the ios updates so unlike everybody else who tells you this is the best traffic source ever i actually am going to show you the best traffic source ever so that you will make more money and then you can actually run in the tracking issues and then buy my product and the only way you're going to do that is if i actually give you the best traffic source and you're able to go and get the results i just got done talking about so instead of hyping this up and talking anymore and showing you cool little like thumb is how do you i got your nose tricks impress you i'm just gonna get right into it let's go okay guys so what i want you to understand in this video is this is how you find the absolute best traffic source this is how you define what's going to be the best traffic source for you in 2021 and then in this video i'll actually tell you what i believe is the best traffic source but you need to understand this first if you understand this you are going to make an absolute killing every person i know that does this makes an absolute killing i have made an absolute killing doing this here's what you need to understand so when you're working on an ad source what you need to understand is the way that you actually make a killing with an ad source is through feedback loops okay and so in order to set up a proper funnel a proper ad campaign what do you need to do well you're going to need to make let's just say for the hi-ros funnel okay i'm going to need to make an opt-in page i'm going to need to make a sales video page and then i'm going to have to have all the call booking and whatnot where the people go on the phone and close the more important thing going on here is going to be the ad the opt-in and the sales video and depending on the traffic source people can behave super differently so for example when i was running hcom which was an info offer i scaled up on youtube to eight figures actually multiple eight figures in sales uh gross the people who came from youtube behaved super differently than people that came from facebook now there's all sorts of theories on why that might be for example a person on facebook is scrolling on their app while they're in line at the grocery store a person on youtube is sitting down and watching something so they're much more inclined to watch a sales video or a webinar presentation but just knowing that know that traffic sources people are going to behave differently because they're using them at different times and for different reasons and they're in different states so when you're writing an ad for facebook or youtube or any other traffic source tick tock doesn't matter you're making an opt-in you're making a sales video the way people behave when they go through these steps of the funnel we can really get rid of the call booking and close that's not entirely important the way people behave when they go through these steps of the funnel is extremely difficult different so you also have to understand that making an ad making an opt-in and making a sales video based on a traffic source is extremely time consuming you can't just make a one-size-fits-all i can't just go i've literally not been able to do this uh outside of highrose highrish just works everywhere because it's just an extremely profitable funnel but i've never been able to do this on facebook and then youtube and then any other so here's what you have to understand next setting up this kind of system right here is extremely time consuming just on its own okay this is this is a lot of work creating three or four ads an opt-in and a sales video for each traffic source there's a lot of work and yes you can cookie cutter clone it back and forth but here's where it gets super complicated and so let's imagine we're doing this on facebook right here then we have an ad and then we have an opt-in and then we have the funnel itself which would be sales videos and whatnot so here's where you get absolutely hosed if you don't understand this the way you make an ad funnel work is for example my highros ads uh for my my software company didn't work at all last year okay the first ones that came up didn't work second ones that came up didn't work but now they generate almost 10x rois how does this happen how does this happen i'm going to be straight up with you a lot of it's word of mouth because hyrus just literally makes people's ad accounts generate 20 to 30 more money like that like clockwork every single time once word gets out about that people start buying it a little bit more and that's that's guaranteed by a 90 day refund guarantee that's not me just throwing something out there if it doesn't do that you don't pay for it so poke a call below anyways the way it got better is i kept looking at the responses to the ads the opt-in and the funnel and through that what happened is feedback loops and what a feedback loop is is imagine you're writing code for example or you're playing guitar either one but if you're writing code and then you run the code for example i code video games very badly all the time but when i'm writing code the reason why i really like the writing code is you instantly get feedback on the code so for example if there's a bug in the code when i go to run it it says there's a bug okay so i instantly know if something's broken in my code but more so if i run the code in a video game i'm going to be testing certain things when i'm writing the code and i'm gonna see something weird happen in the game all right outside the code crashing i'm gonna see like my character uh start dancing across the screen like a maniac because the ragdoll physics is thrown off or something like that i'm gonna go oh something's wrong and so my first code doesn't work my second code doesn't work my usually like 15th attempt at code because i'm terrible doesn't work but the 16th is perfect it gets there it's nice and crispy and it works and you can see how i got there wasn't by getting the code right the first time it was by the rapid feedback loops and constantly improving based on the feedback okay so the same thing is going on with ads but on a much slower scale your feedback loop is usually like one to three days instead of where it's coded it's every 30 seconds that's why you can rapidly improve code but it's hard to rapidly improve an ad because you have to look at a lot of variables so let's say the ad is getting low engagement the opt-in is getting five percent opt-ins and the funnel is getting one percent call conversions in this instance right here okay well i can go and look at all these data points right here and go okay cool we're gonna we're gonna improve the messaging of the ad we're gonna improve the opt-in we're gonna improve the funnel okay and so when we get that then we get the opt-in to 12 opt-in rates that doesn't look like a 12. uh we get the ad to medium engagement so this the cost of clicks and cpm goes down we get the funnel to two percent okay there's there's one feedback loop cycle right there okay and that's usually about like a two week thing and proving it like this okay then we do it again and we do it again and we do it again and just like lines of code we look at what happens and then we react we look at what happens and we react and over the span of six months what happens is this ad goes from low engagement to high as i figure out exactly what customers are looking for and what they're responding to so for example if you look at the first ads for hiros they're very different in the ads right now and that's because i looked at the feedback the customers were giving me okay i looked at what people were clicking and i looked at what ad and media buyers were clicking also in relation to my cpl or opt-in okay and so my opt-in went from you know five seven percent to 40 percent in some cases usually around 30 percent and then my funnel uh conversion rate went from one two percent to five percent to just so high now that i don't even really check it anymore it just works like at a 10x roi i'm i'm fine man this is this optimations this optimization is fine to start scaling with but this happened by me going through these feedback loops where are you going these feed draw don't drag these feedback loops over and over and over again in each feedback loop every result from a feedback loop would at least take about a week now here's what you need to understand about all this you're probably thinking alex what does this have to do with finding the best traffic source here's what it is if i was doing this on youtube if i was doing this on linkedin if i was doing this on tiktok if i was doing this on snapchat the amount of work required just to do this on one traffic source is already 40 50 hours a week if i throw on youtube now i'm at 100 hours a week i throw in linkedin i'm at 150 hours a week so on and so forth unless i start half-assing each traffic source i start going and only investing 20 of the time that's actually needed to actually perform these feedback loops but then what happens is you have these feedback loops that are extremely slow and not optimized at the rate they need to be at instead of taking one ad source to like this instantly with really rapid feedback loops with a ton of attention and time put into them all your traffic sources are going to go like this and this is a really bad example really bad drawing but this right here is probably going to generate five times more than all this right here slowly going up all right look it's for example if you invest in cryptocurrency right now if you invest in 15 different cryptocurrencies and you spread out your investment across all of them this is a weird example even if one skyrockets you're not really going to see that high of an roi whereas if you just focus on one cryptocurrency and you really nail it which again cryptocurrencies are outside of your control let's imagine the cryptocurrencies are inside your control in this example and you really nail it and that one gets a 15xry it's going to make it's going to make more money than having it split across 15 currencies you have to understand this about ads but the thing is unlike cryptocurrencies your effort and time invested controls the accelerated returns right here and you only have so much time to invest it's not like cryptocurrency where you have unlimited money you can make and invest you only got like really 50 hours of concentrated focus smart work you could you could do 70 but after about 40 hours i'm an idiot anyways so that being said if you have a hundred thousand dollars to invest in ads and you want to turn it into two million dollars okay maybe all right let's let's let's take down the numbers alex come on we want to turn into 500 000 our best way is to get into an ad source that's going to give us a huge return and just put it all in that ad source diversifying isn't really helpful in this case because you have to understand unless you're a giant brand that's making hundreds of millions of dollars per year there is more than enough traffic on facebook or youtube or linkedin or tick tock or snapchat to make you 10 to 20 million dollars per year easily there i have i've done it i know multiple people that have done it there is more than enough traffic source on just what there's more than enough traffic and buyers on one traffic source to get you to a income that is nearing tom brady's income if that's what you're looking for right here or at least taking your company to be worth one tom brady how much is a company worth a tom brady sir it's laughable but it's true so what's going to be the best traffic source for you in 2021 well it's quite obvious it's going to be the traffic source that you dedicate all your time to what you shouldn't be doing in 2021 is trying to run on facebook and youtube and tic tac and snap talk and snapchat and whatever club whatever the hell you're doing right here your best way to do it is just to pick one you can experiment with all of them and see the one that works out easiest for you and then just go all in because the thing that actually controls your roi on ad platforms isn't the traffic source it's the feedback loops and improving and optimizing around the if you only optimize if you have 50 hours and you spend 10 hours on each traffic source each one's going to get 20 optimization you're going to see that the way traffic sources work is it's exponential returns on your feedback loops so if you're only putting 20 percent in each one is kind of kind of like bobble and go like this bobble and go like this whereas if you put 100 in it works on an exponential curve so you're going to get farther down the curve and eventually the way traffic sources work is like this okay it's not going to go backwards but you're getting the point and this is when you master the feedback loop of one traffic source in one funnel so to wrap it up if you really want to kill it in ads what you want to do instead is find the traffic source that gives you the the base easiest returns so for example if i started running ads on youtube and facebook and if one of them gave me like a 1.5 x roi and the other ones gave me one x i would just go all in on 1.5 x roi and ignore the other ones until i have so much traffic that doesn't even make sense this is exactly what i did with hcom uh when i scaled it to 20 million dollars in sales facebook was always all over the place and working with their terms of service and everything was always just it was always just kind of like ah so i just said no i'm not gonna run facebook ads and i'm only gonna do youtube ads and the result was all right first off i got the little minimal bounce right here but then what happened is i went deeper and deeper into it okay and i scaled a business past amounts that i couldn't even imagine and i only used one traffic source if i'd used both traffic sources i would have gotten this i would have gone the [Music] like that i would have gotten i wouldn't have scaled it very far and that's the key to buying traffic it doesn't matter where you buy traffic from unless you're buying twitter ads that's that's that never works for anything okay uh ever but if you're buying any other traffic source i i know some in the comments because i need a million dollars on twitter ads you're not an addict okay cool man all right so that being said the way you're going to get the best return is by not diversifying your track traffic this is not a stock portfolio where the the the returns are out of your control so it's better to just spread it all out your returns are a hundred percent under your control and the time and effort invested into them and the returns are always going to be exponential okay if you put a hundred percent in something you're going to see vastly better returns on it than if you put 20 in something because you have to get farther down the curve the more time you put in the farther down the curve you get that's the best way i can explain it so in 2021 stop diversifying and stop trying to be a jack of all trades it doesn't work okay for example facebook works really really really well for me at hi-ros okay now we're actually seeing better results at google ads after all the updates and whatnot however for the first six to seven months i focus almost exclusively on that being said for hcom my info product youtube worked insanely better right off the bat so i only focused on youtube both companies have got an insane rois on their ad spend and it's not by me being a jack of all trades or an all-around ad expert it's by me analyzing what f what platform worked best off the get-go and then going all in on that platform okay so that's the lesson for today just a quick little summary to give you exactly what you actually came here for because i know i kind of tricked you if you're doing info marketing especially to the masses youtube works a lot better if you're doing b2b facebook works a lot better off the bat if you're doing ecom it depends on the econ proctor doing if you're doing like shirts or devices or something that falls outside of the health or wellness niche if you're doing something that falls outside of the skincare or appearance niche basically the big niches out there weight loss whatever then you're probably gonna do better on facebook if you're in those niches though that i just discussed you're gonna do better on youtube because those are mass market niches where you can easily just peg right into the person okay i would also just i would think about i would think about youtube in the future if you're an econ because it's crazy that also being said b2b again better on facebook uh b2c especially better on youtube all right especially if you're doing like a high-end info offer or something like that so for example if you're selling like info products like nine university freaking killed it on youtube uh with a call funnel okay but that's not b2b that's b2c like business is civilian person that's new to something b2b would be like highrose running to media buyers and business owners okay that's what you should look for now that being said two things if you're running any funnel tracking is the most important thing go check out hiros because if you are not seeing 20 to 30 percent of your ad data you're going to make the decision when it comes to scaling and turning off ads wrong 20 to 30 of the time that's going to lead to you making double whammied losses by killing ads that are working and keeping ads on that are not working if you're spending a hundred thousand dollars per year that's an extra thirty to fifty thousand dollars you're just losing just because go check out hyrus we have a 90 day guarantee that we will fix that and actually make you that extra income or you don't pay on top of that if you're interested in seeing how to scale your ads on youtube or even facebook book a call with me below the amount of businesses you can click on the page below that i've helped get to six seven and on youtube just alone on youtube is insane i have more results than any other youtube coach in the entire industry you should check it out at least because it consistently at least does good things or just like with highrose you don't pay all right i have 90 day refund guarantees on all my stuff because it works and if it doesn't work i don't want your money so that being now go subscribe because i release videos like this three times a week because is that how you spell subscribe i want you to make more money i don't hold anything back because i want you to make more money so you eventually buy high roast because everybody needs it for tracking so if i just help you make more money you're eventually just going to buy hybris so i'm just going to tell you everything i know how i've made tens of millions of dollars in gross revenue from go i generate tens of millions of dollars in revenue from youtube and facebook ads and how i grow my businesses with ads i'll just tell you how i do it because i want you to make a lot of money and then buy hiros that's it i'll see in the next video

TITLE: WHY 92% Of Facebook Ads Fail (Don't Do THIS)
VIDEO ID: fNw3Px7wJZk
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNw3Px7wJZk
================================================================================

so i know you see the title of this why facebook ads fail and most people make titles of this on their videos and they act like they know why as the ceo of hirose i see so many ad accounts i've worked with hundreds of people in my iron mastermind who run ads i can literally tell you why ads fail i can tell you exactly why some facebook ads scale to the moon and youtube ads as well and some facebook ads never take off and in this video i'm going to show you exactly why this is not a debate this is not theory this is not me like calculating and get clickbait this is literally why this is literally the difference between super successful ad campaigns and non-successful ones if you get this you can mess up almost everything else and you will still win if you do not get this you could have the best ad targeting the best optimization how you could have the the frank sinatra of running ads in your account and it will not work so take the 15 minutes to understand this because this is how i generate a 10 to 15x roi in my ads well not doing anything that complicated while people doing super complicated things can barely even generate a 1.5 x this is why so pay attention okay guys so this is a simple lesson but it's probably the most important lesson in all of paid advertising i can't stress that enough i know i say hey this is a very important video all the time this is the foundation everything builds on as the ceo of hyros again i'm never going to share anything i see clients personally doing or anything like that i can see the problems that are absolute plagues in the industry and this is by far the number one one if you don't have this understanding you are never going to do well with ads even if you are a master of ads let me explain see i've said this before but i really want to break this down i see people all day try to go and become millionaires or grow their businesses or grow their clients businesses within the ad account they're trying to get the the targeting correct they're trying to get the specific ai optimization correct they're trying to get the exact manual bidding correct they're doing micro audiences and splitting it down they're literally doing albert einstein level stuff that i don't do in my account and my account generates almost a 10 to 15x roi in my ads so am i saying this stuff right here isn't going to help no of course if your if your business is doing really well with ads doing this is going to increase the roi by 20 30 50 percent 50 being excessive i've really never seen anybody grow their business by doing these things massively but what people are failing to understand is that first and foremost for ads to work it's as simple as if you walked into a room of people let's say there's a hundred people that are in the ad space for example okay let's actually say this is in the weight loss space and then let's say there's 10 of you you there's 10 businesses that walk in let's even remove ad spend from this equation if all 10 businesses present their offer okay i'm not sure that's ten but the offer that is worded and the most enticing the offer that is most desired by the marketplace and needed and the offer that is also the hottest and most hyped up is going to do the best that's three places where offers live or die let me repeat that the offer that has the best messaging and best communication or the offer that is most needed in the marketplace or the offer that is just simply in the hottest angle at the current moment the most hyped up angle is going to do the best and if it has all three of those things it is going to absolutely dominate the room and what you need to understand about dominating the room in this instance right here is if the room is dominated in this instance it will also dominate in ads because what's going to happen in advertising is the same exact thing that's going on as i just described in this room you have tons of businesses tons tons tons of businesses presenting to 100 million people instead okay but in your niche in particular let's just let's just say 100 000 people and the way you get the best roi on your ads is not by doing this this crazy optimization stuff right you're never going to outdo an offer you're never going to beat the roi you're never going to have that breakout moment until you are this offer you are that offer that has those three things or one of those three things are all those three things the more of those things you have the better you're going to do with ads for example at highrose right now tracking is very hot for example the reason why my ads at hi-ros do so exceptionally well is first off the market really needs what i'm selling two tracking is extremely hot right now it's all the rage so it's also hot three my messaging and my funnel is incredible okay i present my ad my ad presentation the way the ads are constructed the way the funnel works the way the sales team closes it is superior to any other offer on the market that's similar okay maybe not the best funnel ever made but in tracking and for the most part most b2b ad based offers it is absolutely by far the best you combine those three things together and that's why i can do i'm just going to throw out a random number right here we can easily do 20 to 40 000 a day off of very very little ad spend because we have these three things but what i constantly see people try to do is they say all right what's in the marketplace right now and they try and make an offer that's not hot at all for example a really good example this is sam evansconsulting.com sam originally made this offer when it was very needed in the marketplace and if you don't know what this offer is it's just it's just a very well known info offer where sam taught people how to make consulting businesses and i believe they've done like 20 to 30 million dollars worth of sales and they really set the pace for the entire industry with this offer there's many other offers similar to this like you know for example alex and rosie's gymlaunch.com and you argues accounting.com russ ruffinos i his coaching consulting program thing all these offers have been breakout offers and what they always had is first off the marketplace really needed it okay it was also hot it was new okay when i'm just gonna use consulting.com as an example right it was new like nobody was really teaching this in a way that was this expect this effective and finally also sam i know personally because i've i've just known him for a long time spent so much time on that funnel and messaging and getting the ability to convert the right people that came in that it had these three things right here and it made oodles of money it's one of the most successful info offers of all time but then what people did is they tried to replicate to this day they still replicate it i and my iron mastermind i constantly see people uh that come in and try and just completely rip off these the offers i just mentioned i can't tell you how many uh agency offers or grow your first consulting business offers i see and people's ads don't work and they think hey is it because i don't have the optimization set i don't have some specific targeting is my ai back in learning phase i cannot tell you how many people i see come into iron or try to use hi-ros and they they think that their entire business lives and dies by the pixel on facebook which again the pixel on facebook is important but it's only going to give you a 15 increase okay if you're targeting everything is perfect it's going to give you a 15 to 20 increase tops that's not enough to turn a business that's not working or breaking even into an explosively successful business and so what people try and do is they go and try and replicate sam's offer but it's not new on the marketplace anymore okay it's not needed there's already there's sam's course is already out there and there's already like 15 other courses that are also comp competent it's not hot okay consulting simply is not hot people are way more interested as i shoot this video and amazon fba that's that's what people are really interested in the info marketing make money online space and this can apply to everything i just know this space pretty well and then finally their messaging simply isn't as refined the funnels and all the marketing and the sales copy it just isn't it isn't there and so they have none of these advantages and so then they try and go to their their advertising and they spend they pay some super agency they take all these courses they take all these classes on optimizing their ads and getting everything perfectly right everything's dialed down to a t they're doing the most complicated demographic targeting i've ever seen they're optimizing their ai and doing manual bidding in ways that i can't even comprehend as as a person it is not the most successful ad runner of all time but i've generated tens of millions of dollars that came in at a significant roi so i know what i'm talking about and it doesn't work and it's because they're missing these foundations right here when you're thinking of running your business on ads when you're thinking of taking your business on ads you need to look at the market the best advice i can ever give anybody when it comes to running paid advertising and getting very successful at paid advertising is the first thing you should do is look at the market and what does the market need what is the market obsessed about ak what is hot and then what messaging will the market respond to okay so for example the messaging the market will respond to and the make money online space would be a new opportunity that's hot and push button for example i'm going to say at hiros i'm going to make up something right here but when i was using one message that focused on scaling ads and i was using another message on focusing on ai the ai message responded better and then so i constructed the funnel based around ai and that type of optimization while moving and selling things in a certain way that i knew would convert and i improved the messaging and that's when my ads also took off as well so that's what messaging is and so you need to look at this because what most people try and do is they try to take something that is not hot it's not needed and the messaging is not anything that's that's going to really entice people because it's either been said before or it's just not enticing in the first place and this is usually done by people trying to sell what they want to sell instead of what the market wants and so they're messaging reeks of what they want to sell and guess what the market doesn't buy what you want to sell it buys what it wants to buy okay if the market wants a washing machine that is dyed pink and poops bubbles out the back in and fills your house with a disco strobe light but you want to sell a classy upper class washing machine doesn't really matter the market's going to buy that disco ball washing machine then the whole point of this lesson is once you achieve these things right here it is actually extremely easy to run ads even if you're not that good at it now what do i mean by this i'm very good at running ads i'm very good at writing ad copy i've again generated tens of millions of dollars off of much less ad spend than that that being said nothing i really do these days on youtube or on facebook is something that i would say is super out of reach of a beginner i'm not saying in this video if you're a beginner you should get in the ads you're gonna make a ton of money i don't think you'll make much money at all okay i'm saying what i'm doing is not really outside the realm of learning of a person in about two months of ad running there's nothing i'm really doing that's that complicated that you couldn't learn to do in two months very efficiently even less than that now of course i have some instincts and other things that are built upon that but what i'm trying to stress right here is that there's no secret to my ads beyond besides these things and just good ad copy there's no magic ai targeting there's no magic there's no magic deep crazy thing going on with my bidding it is simply understanding this foundation right here and with that being said because i have this foundation i greatly outperform people that make the complicated stuff we talked about earlier their foundation i absolutely destroy them it's not even close roi wise my i have them one of the most cash profitable ad funnels ever that i've ever seen and it's because i don't focus on this and this is why facebook ads fail in the most obvious simple way that i could ever describe they feel because people ignore the market and focus on the ad platform optimization it needs to go the other way around ninety percent of your focus or at least eighty percent needs to go on the offer and what the market is doing that's it if you get that right you can have bad ads and will still work one of the most successful businesses i know they made close to 100 million dollars in sales off of very little ad spend their funnel i'm not insulting it it was not anywhere near as optimized as 90 of the funnels that you see online right today it just was not it was a very very simple basic one page funnel their profit margins were insane it's because they nailed this and their ads were okay their ads are good i'd say they're in the top 70 top 25 percent of ads but they had this and this is where the profits came from it didn't come from that and all day long at hiros i watch ad managers freak out over this and completely ignore the other thing and then they're they're constantly shocked why their ads aren't profitable and do not scale that's the point that's absolute point then the final thing i would add to that track your ads with hieros if you are not tracking your ads with hiros you are literally wasting and making 15 to 20 less than you should be from your ads by default if you're making 100 000 a month from your ads you can make an extra 20k a month very easily that's an extra 200k a year for doing literally nothing except that's actually more than 200k tracking your ads correctly and making good ad buying decisions on top that if you want help actually making your offers

TITLE: EMERGENCY!!! APPLE just NUUKED FB ADS [take this action now!!!!]
VIDEO ID: oVPC1Z1f63o
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPC1Z1f63o
================================================================================

guys i'm straight of the shower because for the first time ever the thumbnail actually matches the severity of this video the ios update went live and it hit facebook tracking way harder than i thought it would i frankly didn't think would have that much of an impact and it did if you're wondering why i'm smiling it's because it didn't hit higher at all we were already better at tracking before and with our facebook api integration we actually work with facebook to make your tracking really really good so it's it's really excellent for me but we already had preparations in place if we did get hit so it wasn't like something i was concerned about but i'm also haven't been really concerned about it because the way we track is very ethical we track people from the websites that the businesses put us on we're not tracking people moving all around the internet and watching what they're doing we're just simply recording people hitting the websites of the businesses that have us on there so it's not invasive it's not digging into where people are going it's just where they are i'm not here to talk about that i want to give you the updates on this i was resisting making this video for a long time because i wanted to wait and see what happened instead of just going on like everybody else and talking about what they think is going to happen no one works at apple so they can't tell you now that things have gone live i'd like to share things with you on top of that i'm not going to pitch hiros in this video if you're interested in fixing your tracking there's a link to it on literally every other video on this channel and more so i want to show you how to fix this or at least understand how to fix it it's actually pretty simple if you understand the premise of everything that's happening just do me a favor and just watch the video i'm going to keep it super short and you don't need to be tempted to click away from the video there's not going to be any like fast action pitch or something like that so let's get to it okay guys so first thing first and foremost i am a tracking expert i've worked in tracking for my own ads and deeply deeply deeply inside of tracking at hiros for years so i want to stress in this video one thing i don't also work at apple okay and so while i know how tracking works i don't work at apple so i can't tell you everything technology wise is an update i can just tell you what i'm seeing and i can tell you what i believe that we're seeing so first off what you need to understand just happen and i believe the first and foremost thing that apple focused on is blocking facebook's apps and what you need to understand is two things about how facebook tracks and then also how their apps track and one thing i want to point out this video is not the hate on facebook they're tracking for what it's been the past few years is incredible because it's a one size fits all slap on solution that doesn't require any customer support that's pretty cool and i want to also stress that what we do at high risk is work with facebook we're not here to bash facebook or like say facebook is dead use us instead frankly what i'm going to show you at this end of this video is how we actually work with facebook to make facebook ads better than ever that being said what apple really went after first is the app and you need to understand when you're on the app scrolling around on your phone what's happening is you're being tracked the entire time because you're in facebook's let's just use for lack of better words i'm going to dumb this all down you're in their network all right so everything you're doing on there you're being tracked all your actions are being tracked as you use the app that's not good okay because it can see that you're on the app it could see who you are can see everything you're looking at and then when you click out of the app what also happens is you're still viewing websites inside the app so it can see everywhere you're going and everywhere you're moving around to i'm not going to talk about whether this is good or bad i think i don't think anyone's a fan of this but more importantly this is what apple went in and targeted okay and so you have to understand that like let's say this is the website and everything that's going on the website server level and then the website is contained in the app all right so this is the container of the app and so the app is watching everything you're doing from here but what it did is it just blinded the app the website can still see what you're doing this is why for example server side tracking which is what hirose is or if maybe you've set up your own custom solution in the past that's why this is working just fine because the the ios system isn't blocking websites from loading up okay isn't blocking websites from loading up and even when you're looking at the website you're in the facebook browser okay so that also being said what you also have to understand about facebook tracking is that it's semi blind all right you have to look at where the tracking is applied at so when you click an ad what's going to happen is there's going to be an fb click id on the link which isn't necessarily tracking it's just used for identification purposes and what's going to happen is this is where your tracking begins at now the problem is whenever you jump from page to page this has been going on forever by the way this isn't anything new specifically if you're on safari or firefox what happens is it wipes the facebook tracking now of course you have the facebook pixel up here but the reason why this is bad is when these clo these browsers are closed down the tracking is lost uh to some extent all right and again i don't work at facebook all i can tell you is what we've seen going on in the tracking okay what we've seen in our tracking and their tracking this right here could be fundamentally wrong i want to stress that okay i don't want to make any statements where i'm just pulling stuff out of my butt i'm just telling you what i think okay so at this point the tracking is lost whenever you close down the browser you switch devices or whatnot this isn't great for tracking in the first place this is one of the reasons why facebook tracking had a lot of inaccuracies with webinar funnels call funnels etc because really tracking is applied right here and then you're watched right here and so it can watch when you're logged into facebook and watch basically when your browser is connected to facebook but as soon as this is closed down these browsers are switched you hop to another device the tracking's lost in the first place so this isn't necessarily important to update this is how it tracked before the main thing you need to understand is that one of the key ways where it had a huge way to track with and apply tracking from the app just got knocked out and so most people are using the facebook app or they're using safari on the ios system which is again kind of doing similar things i'm not sure every place that apple wiped out their tracking but it looks like if you're on an app that's in uh if you're an app that's in the ios system it's going to be slapping the stuff and the reason why this is also bad again is because facebook tracking needs to have that connection to facebook it's not reapplied every single click it's not actually stored on the server when the click comes in so let me explain pretty much how highros works or any server side tracking works so if a person clicks a facebook ad on facebook what happens is the link itself first off iris is going to grow i'm just going to use hiros as the example right here and sorry if i'm talking fast i'm just excited because this is this is cool that being said what's going on right here is facebook is going to send in a facebook click id and then there's also going to be a parameter talking to hirose that tells you what facebook ad it came from and i'm going to use hiros as an example in this video you can also interchange this with server-side tracking i'm not trying to press you into buying hiros you should be setting up some type of server side tracking i think hyrus is the best for it but if you want to set up something custom by all means you just need to understand this so the parameter that's in the facebook link which is going to be a little light of text after the link and the facebook id is going to be collected on the page okay and so right off the bat hyrus is going to know that this ad was the thing that generated this click and this is exactly where this person came from so what then happens is every other link they click on the website let's imagine they go back to their cell phone and click an email to get to this page let's imagine they close the browser down and then reopen the browser doesn't really matter we have enough levels of tracking to recognize so the tracking is reapplied at every step on top of that let's imagine the person goes to a website and this is an opt-in page then they land on the thank you page for the opt-in then they come back to a checkout later on and then they process it in a stripe what's going on right here is the data is reapplied and rechecked and recorded at each of these steps and so as long as we can connect one piece of data to the overall big chunk of data that's being collected it really doesn't matter we know exactly who clicked the ad and where they came from more importantly as soon as we see the data come in what happens is we can easily go and say oh okay this is the data that came in and the re the place that this person came from the original source was this ad and this was the original facebook click id now here's where it gets really cool because then we can go and basically say all right this is the facebook click id and facebook knows this they have this information right here so then what we can easily do is say hey facebook we can use their marketing api by the way i could be wrong here but i'm extremely sure that i'm not iris is the only system that does this we're only one that connects to the facebook click id like this okay we also do this for google ads as well that being said what we do is we say hey facebook this is the this is who clicked and then facebook goes oh okay i know who this person is and i know what this ad is and then they go and place the conversion inside their system which then trains their ai pixels the same way you were training them before except much better because we're dealing with 100 accurate data or at least as close to 100 as we can possibly get here so the main takeaway is that well this original tracking that facebook was using in the past just take a major hit a that wasn't the best form of tracking in the first place b it wasn't the best way to train your ai see the same solutions before server-side tracking that was already the better way to train your pixels in ai and the better way to track your ads it's still there and you can still train your ai much better and you can still assign sales directly in your facebook ad manager you don't even need for example here's a picture screenshot of a customer sent me yesterday after the update happened you don't even need to be using the hi-ros chrome extension which if you look right here in my browser shows me way more calls collected yesterday than facebook collected but i can push this data back like this customer showed you right here and literally my ads don't change i'm still pushing the same exact data right in the ad manager and still training my pixel so that's what's going on that's what okay i don't work at apple or facebook and those are the solutions to it you should definitely be looking into server-side solutions i think iris is the best i think our competitors are terrible that's one of the reasons why hiros has done so well the past year that being said you should be looking into having someone set up a server-side solution for you if you're interested in checking out hi-ros every other video on this channel has a link to it below it every single one i'm not going to do it on this video because i just wanted to go and break down what is happening and how you should be looking at it so this has been becker take it easy you

TITLE: HOLY...THESE TINY AD FUNNELS MAKE 30k DAILY
VIDEO ID: ON7qL3w1Ipw

================================================================================

hyrulians this 2021. we're going to do the same exact thing we did last year i'm going to give you the best ad content you've ever got and today i'm going to simply give you what is in the title of this video i'm going to show you the best funnels to be running on youtube ads and unlike people who hype stuff up and like this is the best thing ever i'm just going to show you from my experience one of these funnels uh actually was generating almost nearly on some days a hundred thousand dollars per day and this other funnel that i've used a lot is routinely pumping out for at least my business around twenty to thirty thousand dollars back a day off about almost two thousand dollars an ad spend so they're really good but of course it's about how the funnels work and how they interact altogether but if you're going to be running ads on youtube or on facebook these are the best from everything that i've seen across hiros myself being the ceo of that i'm not going to talk about anything that our clients are doing but of course i have a pretty good thumb on the pulse of the industry from what i've seen every single time i see a really successful business running on youtube they're running one of these so without further ado we're just going to hop straight into this and so without further ado this and by the way as you watch this video if you want to get actually coaching or training or consulting on this i'm going to teach you everything i know in this video but if you'd like more of that book a call with me below my team we can actually help you get set up on youtube as well but more importantly let me show you this works okay guys so i said i was going to talk about a few of the best funnels but there's really only one funnel i think you should really be looking at and considering and if you can't do this funnel i think you should take the reasons why this funnel works and take it to as much hard as you can every single person who i know that has made a hundred million dollars plus from ads and this isn't this is a hyperbole statement they run this funnel now of course there's other examples but most commonly the people that do it the easiest for example i have a really good friend i'm not going to name him if you're in the marketing world you might know who he is he's not he's not a mmo slash make money online marketer just does something for businesses make close to i'm just going to say a number because you'll guess if i give you the number he made over 80 to 100 million dollars in sales and he barely ran any money on ads it was next to nothing and what i'm going to show you in this video is i'm going to be straight up with yet hi-ros and iron my consulting business we really don't run many ads i'm shocked by it because i consistently spend about a thousand to it max 3 000 a day on ads usually around about 2 000 and routinely i'm going to do about and of course there's going to be hard costs of the business and everything else that comes with it i'm just talking about add roi cash in same day i'm usually going to be doing anywhere between 15 to sometimes as much as 35k a day off it's absolutely bonkers and i've never had a funnel that works like this before i had a webinar funnel when i was running h-com but i'd be spending 15 to 25k a day back and i'd say the roi on that when everything was said and done was anywhere between 35 on a good day where we had good margins and what that 50k a day okay and this is hard to do and not sustainable this right here i'm it's like i'm driving a car and i'm i'm barely having my phone on the gas this right here man i'm putting uh alcohol in the engines and i'm drunk at the same it's it's risky endeavor so let's talk about this and if you've probably seen any of my funnels you know their sales call funnels but i want to show you the two types of funnels that i run and why they're very very different let me tell you first why sales call funnel works and i'm going to show you my phone highros which i think is it's magnificent okay i've never had anything that pumps up this high of an roi i'm gonna break down why that works here in a second but you need to understand why sales call funnels are just basically the best thing for paid ads so look a lot of people think paid ads the goal is to make money now that's true that's true but the goal of ads really is to cover ad costs to get people into your business this is where the golden goose is everyone who doesn't make a lot of money thinks like this everybody who does make a lot of money thinks like this for example not a famous quote from russell brunson but i know he runs his ads just like this and he says all the time the goal of click funnels with their advertising is just to get people in to their business without losing money and that's not even in the clickfunnels just into the community okay so if they spend a hundred dollars and if they make 110 that's a phenomenal roi absolutely absolutely fantastic this is how clickfunnels grew into a giant company uh if you look at most sas companies or most tech companies how they run is for example hubspot let's imagine a person pays 100 a month over there they're willing to spend twelve hundred dollars to get that person in because they know the person is going to stay over two years so they don't make their money back 2x until two years in which if you look at an investment standpoint it's phenomenal we're just really short sighted here in internet marketing and ad buying the best way to make a return on ad spend is to maximize the amount you make from the buyers the way you do that is like this for example let's say we get a thousand people come into a funnel okay we're paying ten dollars per person we just paid ten thousand dollars so getting seven percent of these people seven percent of this which is actually pretty low actually we'll even crank it up if we get ten percent of these people to buy let's just say a fifty dollar product so we get a hundred people to buy a fifty dollar product we made five thousand dollars that's not five thousand this isn't great which is weird because this conversion rate right here is insane i've never gotten a 10 conversion even on like a seven dollar product okay i have but it was like doing a launch and doesn't count that's not how ads work if we get a thousand people to come in and we get three of them to buy a 5 000 product we just made a 50 roi it's not hard to get a 0.003 conversion rate it is extremely hard extremely hard to go and get a 10 conversion rate this is why it works better with ads this is the simple basic reason why i almost actually i haven't ran a low ticket product in almost six years because it doesn't work very well it's really hard to do and i don't like hard things because i'm kind of stupid so why do sales call funnels work the best it's very simple if we get a thousand people to come into a funnel specifically if it's like b2b or b2c i would say there's probably about 20 people who are capable of buying this very very high ticket product that you're going to sell in a sales call funnel now in order to maximize if we do like a webinar funnel or a sales video or just send them to a sales video it's just not going to convince these people and to get someone to buy something very expensive they usually need to be sold to specifically so you can listen to them and see what they're looking for and then sell them what they're looking for and i'm not i'm not saying in a scuzzy way for example at hiros a person might have an e-commerce business or a webinar business they might have certain problems that they have there's different other businesses and so we need to ask them what problems you are okay yeah my webinar sales i can't track the ltv and i'm really trying to get the ltv of my opt-ins okay you can easily do that in hi-ros oh okay great i'll buy or hey i just can't see where my sales are coming from for example i run my ads and 30 to 50 percent of sales are missing in the ad managers so i can't make good decisions okay well you know high risk fixes that instantly or hey you know the ai isn't finding me customers well enough okay well hyrus fixes that instantly because we sent data back over so it's it's very easy for us to talk to the person figure out what they're looking for and we can easily sell them something at a very high value that's why it's a very simple concept you can't do this with a webinar you can't do this with a sales video now are those more low effort and more automated yeah of course but again the goal of an ad and this is where the real juice in a sales call funnel comes from is to get people opted into the business because then you can do all sorts of marketing all sorts of marketing for example at hcom a lot of the money didn't come from the initial ads it came from the people who opted into the ads now that also being said if we need a person opt-in and then we have a sales call funnel which is really the only funnel i think can do like a forex cash roi easy i don't see other funnels doing that and i see a lot of funnels other ones that are exceptions this rule yeah i'm sure there might be someone in the comments but like i had a book funneled it pumped out of 10x roi that's fantastic most funnels i see the big ones the big webinar funnels they're probably doing a 2x roi max most of them break even most low ticket funnels i see they lose money and then they make money in the back end all the sales call funnels i see it's just clown mode okay again one of the most profitable ones i ever saw y'all saw he barely ran ads and that's how you want your business to be now i'm probably pretty sure that you've seen a sales call funnel before by the way everything i go into here if you want us to actually look at your sales call funnel and kind of show you how we run ads you can book a consultation with me below and we'll just literally walk through how i'm doing this on youtube and facebook on the call that also being said with these funnels the most imperative thing is tracking if you run a sales call funnel or a webinar funnel or you have a long sales funnel you probably already see that most of your sales don't end up in the ad manager at least you're missing 30 40 percent of them track it with highrose because if you're going and this is just a general tip for sales call funnels because if you're watching this you might have one or our long-term funnel look if you have three ducks one two three and one of them is pumping out a 400 roi one of them is pumping out a 50 roi another one's pumping out 150 ry you need to know which ones are because if they're if you're going and spreading them equally based on the opt-in which is what most people do or some general other stat that's not based around roi you're silly because you could literally just cut this guy off you could cut this guy off and you could just quadruple down on this guy and your business is now way more profitable growing much faster simply by doing nothing okay and then you push this back to the ai your ai gets smarter and then that's the pixels that you're working with and then you get customers much cheaper it calls much cheaper and it just works and you should do it and if you're not tracking properly especially with the sales component where you can't even see the sales inside of facebook and youtube i can't tell you how many people i know with sales call funnels that don't track based on roi they trapped on it they track based on cost per call and often it's insane because if you're doing that then you're optimizing for the cheapest people that will book calls which is not your best customer i have call funnels where the calls are 400 a call and they absolutely just wreck shop okay so let's discuss this right here this is my first sales call funnel this one works really well i'm going to show you the one that works best but if you're doing info marketing or some type of like consulting where you're doing an ad agency or maybe you're like helping specific types of businesses this is what i would suggest doing and i'll talk about when to run what i'm using for hirose next so look it's just a basic opt-in right here person comes in books gmail.com and they move on to the next page so i'm going to give you just a few cents on this what i love to do on this type of call funnel right here is i basically have as short as video as i possibly can i want to get it done in about 10 minutes below i don't i don't really don't like linking these things below the video so you just can kind of go figure it out to yourself but you can just see right here this is basically just a seven minute sales video okay and actually i'll upload the sales video as a private link below this uh just on the channel i'll just put like a sales video example section so this thing works really really well and what's going to happen is about 10 minutes in the person gets the book a call then they're going to go a very simple call page like this and they just book a call with my rep and they go through this is what works if you look at some other funnels they're so complicated upsells down cells you got these webinar funnels are crazy i'm really good at them but they're just crazy this works absolutely fantastic and so i would really suggest running this if you're specifically youtube ads and this on facebook like this is just this is just what you should do in 2021 and if you can't do you should find some way to sell the most expensive product you possibly can on your front end to cover your ad costs and you can make all your money in your back end this is why i absolutely love this funnel now let me show you the real golden goose because i love this one because what you should try to do on your funnels when you're running ads is you want to remove as many parts as possible usually with this opt-in funnel this works really well the one i just showed you because this is how you run it and this works better with my info product you want to run the opt-in funnel with info products because what you're doing is usually the person's already seen what you're selling you're not selling a unique opportunity for example if you're selling seo you're selling some some course or something like that there's a thousand other things out there so you kind of have to lure them in and really kind of work on them and so you want to run the ad to the opt-in and what's going to happen is they're going to see the first video and you might actually make money just from there but where it really becomes easy is if you have an email sequence that just goes on for months and you just keep sending them valuable content with a link to buy or a link to book a call and i mean if you send really good content to people eventually they're just going to book a call with you because they opt in in the first place because they're interested in what you're offering they're interested at least in the results if you just prove that you're the right guy you're trustworthy and can deliver the results over and over again by sending them really high value packed videos which is what i'm doing to you right now you're not stupid um [Music] but let's also be frank if you're a high roast user you make more money from your advertising you upgrade your account and you pay us more let's just be frank with what i'm doing here and that's why i'm just telling you i'm just giving you the farm right here because i want your ad accounts to grow because then you're going to run in the tracking issues and then you're going to use hyrus to solve them and we're all going to win you're going to make more money i'm going to make more money and then we can go hang out and have a birthday party somewhere i'm not coming to your birthday party you probably don't want me there i'm i'm i'm a real wet blanket anyways so just some general two cents on funnels so if you look at this page right here it's literally just a single page and what you want to do if you're in a b2b business is specifically where you have something unique and you can guarantee results like i do at highrose for example we have a 90 day refund guarantee if you don't increase your ad roi which is up to you or you're not happy with the results you just don't pay okay so that allows me to make just this crazy offer where we're going to increase your ad roi you don't pay this is essential with with b2b call funnels if you can't guarantee a result and you're doing b2b that's just weird okay uh that also being said we scroll down right here what i like to do on a b2b sales call funnel that works very well is you can see i have a very short video the the pitch the book a call actually comes out about 45 seconds in and all i try to really do in a b2b video is i try to show people the opportunity loss that they're missing and this is essential for ads b2b you don't ever want to sell some mysterious like benefit you want to be very simple i'm selling you a hundred dollar bill for twenty dollars a person signs up for hiros they stand for high uh iron the entire pitch is like look you can make a hundred dollars if you pay us twenty dollars you can make more money from your ads you can make more money from your business with youtube ads tracking and if you don't you don't pay us and that just works great because i can back up all the results i have more results with youtube ad coaching than anybody ever and then hyrus the results are ridiculous so that's what you want to do if you're in that type of position you can describe your business like that don't go for the opt-in go and run a single page and then show people your results and then make it very clear that you're selling a hundred dollar bill for twenty dollars okay they can just come on and they will get the results that they're looking for which is making more money from their things all businesses want to grow all businesses want to grow so if you can go and make that case very strongly and guarantee it just shoot for that as long as you can make the case and clearly show that you can do it and make them understand the case okay so just a one-page funnel and then what i like to do on this actual funnel right here is i like to give everybody everything all at once so you can see what i do is i make the case up here and then what i do is i show basically specific instances because the person looking at this page probably has specific problems and so what i do is i say hey look if you want to see it actually in action go check out these specific videos on these things that being said this main video right here makes the case and if that's all i need to make it's a seven minute video goes 14 minutes breaking down what's going to be on the call but you can just skip all this stuff right here and go there because most of the time b2b businesses or owners they're not going to watch a 30 minute but you can't even get me to watch a 7 minute cat video that way you're going to get me to watch a video on ad tracking for seven minutes come on that's what i like to do for b2b and unique b2b businesses look if you're selling seo you're selling the same exact thing that everybody else is you might actually be able to pull off the single page thing but if you're selling info marketing you're selling make money online courses you're selling like fitness courses you're probably gonna need to run the opt-in call funnel instead and again you're probably thinking well you know i don't feel comfortable selling a two thousand five thousand ten thousand dollar product you should and this doesn't have to be your core product you need to sell one of your higher level products up first because then you can get everybody in via the opt-in and you can sell your lower level products first them and you can send them through these sequences which is where the real money is the goal of ads the goal of the offer yourself formats is to pay for the ad if you can break even on the ad while getting people in you are a dynamo you are awesome you should you should have a small parade if you can make money like a two three x roi or doing it well then you're as cool as me and you can come to my secret squirrel club it's it's a tree house outside my apartment it's actually made of boxes and it's really cool it's for secret scrolls only you don't want to go there it kind of smells but that being said guys this is the lesson for today i just want to break down how these funnels work to you and make them make you really aware of them because when i look at hirostats when i look at my stats when i look at all the funnels i've ran throughout the years this thing just dominates and i can't imagine running any other funnels because they're so tough webinar funnels are tough um they work though they work like crazy okay i was able to scale the hcom funnel past a million dollars per month some months that's it what that's insane lower ticket funnels i'm not talented enough to do that if you can do that you should come up here and teach instead and then sales call funnels i've worked very very very hard on the highest funnel and the whole reason it works very very well is because also we always deliver results or people don't pay for them makes it easy to sell it so just keep that in mind so that being said guys if you're interested in learning more about this or applying this to your business number one why not just book a call with me if you have a sales call phone or an info funnel we can connect it to youtube ads and you'll make significantly more about if you don't if you don't believe me go click the consultation link below and see literally some of the hundreds of businesses that i've gotten significant results i'm not talking like hey oaks is really nice and i like them i mean like their business came in and they're making a lot more money now if you want to actually track your ads and you want to run your ads correctly and make the correct most profitable decisions while turning off the unprofitable ads click the link below this video it will give you a demo of hyrule so we'll show you everything we do and i literally guarantee that if you sign up for hirose you will see an roi increase in your ads or we just give you your money back that's it that also being said subscribe this channel i'm uploading about three to four times a week here i give away all the ad content i can in about 12 to 15 minutes for the very simple reason is if you're my customer you're not my customer if you make more money from ads you're going to want to become a customer or you're going to increase your high rose account so i'm just going to tell you everything i know and i know quite a bit so subscribe i'll just keep telling it to you it's been becker i'll catch you next video [Applause] foreign

TITLE: URGENT : YOUTUBE ADS ARE CRUSHING FACEBOOK IN 2021
VIDEO ID: UPNxJeDrx18
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPNxJeDrx18
================================================================================

since the dawn of time since the days of achilles since the day of caesar octavius and marcus aurelius there has been one question on the minds of human beings what is the best ad platform who will get you the cheapest people to your website to buy things in an efficient way that's literally caesar quote from him right here uh look it's 2021. you're probably wondering should i use facebook should i use youtube i have scaled businesses to eight figures on youtube and facebook i have helped multiple people scale to six seven and eight figures on facebook and youtube i own hiros which helps people track their ads correctly to get a higher roi and then combine that with the ai on facebook and youtube to optimize your ads get even higher roi so i can kind of see what's happening across the entire industry across almost every single niche so when i tell you in this video i'm going to tell you which platform is better in 2021 well i got a lot of data points and so it's probably going to be closer to true than it's not or at least better than all the other people screaming like this is the best thing we're going to use data and what you're going to see in this video is that they are better at certain things depending on your business depending on the type of funnel you run depending on what you're selling it's sometimes better to start on facebook other times it's better start on youtube and so i'm going to be breaking it all down for you in this video that being said i can only get this so much in a 15 minute video so if you'd actually like help with your ads my team and i have actually helped multiple businesses scale to six figures seven figures eight figures actually hundreds of businesses at this point you can click below and see all the results you can book a call with us and we will actually help you scale your ads as well and we'll hop in a strategy call with you and actually show you everything you need to do to scale your ads on youtube which i think is a little bit of a better traffic source this year by about 25 percent let me show you why all right guys so let's just get down to it we're talking about what is going to be the best traffic source of 2021 and if you want my overwhelming decision i'm going to give it to you at the end of this video but you have to ask yourself with these two traffic sources youtube or facebook what niche are you in and i'm going to cover the niches in this video i'm going to cover kind of my predictions but these aren't predictions i see the stats every day and it's really obvious here's what you need to know all right it depends on what niche you're in whether you're in e-commerce or in a certain niche inside of e-commerce i'll get into certain niches that are very different or if you are in high ticket infield marketing which would be sales call funnels where you're selling an 8k product et cetera or if you're in consulting okay and so i want to talk about these three because these are really you if you run an online business you probably fall into one of these categories all right so so first things first let's talk about youtube for info businesses okay so look when you're running an info business you have to understand that youtube is by far the most superior traffic source for info marketing period okay so for example if you check out the page below i'm not saying sign up or book a call for iron but when you do check out that page you'll see countless businesses that are in info marketing that have crossed the six and seven figure market is primarily fueled by youtube on top of that when i look at hiros every single day the businesses that are crushing the most on youtube are going to be info business now does this mean ecommerce and other businesses won't crush it no it's because when people are watching youtube they're in an info-consuming mood they're there usually to learn if you're catching them on youtube now there's there's definitely circumstances on youtube where people are not there to learn but you need to compare the state that the person is in when they're on facebook versus the state that a person is when you grab them with an info ad or a education ad on youtube on youtube they're actively watching something on facebook they're in the line at whole foods doing something else it's it's very easy to understand why they convert so much better to webinar funnels and why they convert so much better to sales call funnels i'll be getting into these funnels actually in the next video we're going to be trying to release about three to four videos a week in the next video i'm going to be talking about the best sales funnels for youtube and facebook right now so the reason why i can say this is because when i scaled one of my info businesses i was spending anywhere from 15 to 25 000 per day and i'm going to tell you straight up that when i was spending this amount of money right here the returns on youtube were significant so for example if i was spending 15 25 k a day what would usually happen is when we did everything back when did all the payment plans completions whatever we're usually doing about 40 to 50k back a day okay and of course there'd be all sorts of other hard costs and businesses and stuff like that so we could probably lower this down to i don't know 30 to 40ish k a day on good days so i don't want to use big imaginary numbers that's about what we were doing around this time so that being said when i run these same exact ads on facebook i would get a much lower return that's why i think if you're an info marketer right now and you're running ads on facebook it's just silly because i think the number one reason why they perform so much better is that key they're already watching something mentality and info is sold with sales videos okay info is sold with sales videos people don't know who tai lopez is because of his facebook ads they know who he is because of his youtube ads so that's what you need to focus on right here 2021 by far if you're in an info business and you're not running youtube ads you are missing out on growing your info business immensely because what's going to probably happen now that all the election and everything is over hopefully the us is about to go like this and with that comes the demographic that buys info the most that's going to be your uh people that's going to be your middle class to slightly upper class incomes okay the people that have lots of money right now they're probably not buying info okay now don't get me wrong info is doing quite well right now however as soon as the nation starts to take up again which i believe is about to happen it's just going to explode and you want to be in a position to double down on that with youtube now let's talk about e-commerce the e-commerce that works really well on youtube there's two types of them there's high ticket e-commerce which is for example people may be selling solar power are really high ticket items okay so you might see people selling solar panel ads where you put panels in your house they have to be expensive because it doesn't really work you should check out my video that i'm going to link to right below this video i'll link to a few of them but it explains the type of products that work on youtube and why they usually need to be high ticket if you're selling little 30 dollar trinkets or the general things that you see people selling in e-commerce it usually doesn't work out very well okay so first off if you're running high-ticket e-commerce you want to be on youtube okay it's because again you're going to need sales videos and sales calls to sell these things and this is superior now if you are also running what i like to call entertainment e-commerce so if you're looking at makeup if you're looking at e-commerce products that tie in the channels with mass thousands amounts of views for example what's interesting right now is if you look at all the crypto channels that are blowing up if you were selling like wallet devices or things that help people stow their crypto that's a form of e-commerce now we do exceptionally well because the channels are blowing up however if you're selling weird off things like cat food bowls and whatnot that could actually do really well on youtube as well now that i think about it i've seen examples like that what you need to think about when you're running ecommerce on youtube and i see this all the time with people where it works and people where it doesn't work is you need to look at how many people are routinely watching videos that relate to your e-commerce product it's not really like facebook where you can easily go and target people based on their interest and then they just buy i don't know hats or something like that it's gonna be hard to sell those however if you're selling things that relate to the entertainment videos on youtube that does very very well now if you're outside those niches for example if like i was in the camping niche on youtube that probably wouldn't do very well because it's really hard to find mass amounts of views talking about camping it's really hard to find mass amounts of views where people are talking about air purifying machines yes the views are there but they're not there in mass okay you can probably target people that are interested in health and wellness way better on facebook and then sell them these devices that works a lot better and so if you're not in a niche where you can easily make the connection facebook is the reigning king of e-commerce okay you just that that's just what you should know about that now for consulting again it's another catch-22 because i've ran extremely profitable funnels actually run two extremely profitable funnels that are consulting funnels right now somewhat we could say this is also consulting in sas so at the moment i run hybros uh which is our software company which works for high level ad runners okay so basically a person plugs in the high roast they instantly are able to get like a 15 20 percent higher roi due to the tracking and optimization we provide that's kind of more almost like a consulting service because we sell something very high ticket and we sell it through a sales call funnel on youtube if i'm running these type of ads i don't get the same type of easy conversions that i do on facebook now don't get me wrong hirose ads work really really well on youtube for us but they're much much easier to run on facebook as far as my iron consulting program i run a little bit of ads on that and it's just they perform far better far better on facebook and the reason for this is i can't particularly explain it i think it's just generally a lot easier to target small demographics on facebook okay so think about like this if you go look at the targeting for youtube what you're going to run into is it's very broad mass market this is the big difference between these traffic sources youtube is purely mass market marketing and so it's really easy to scale from a thousand to 25 000 a day it's totally possible to do i've done it before if you're in a mass market the thing is if i want to target people that specifically run ads or people that specifically maybe like contractors for homes very hard to do if i want to target like gym owners very hard to do facebook's as simple as going in and targeting people that fall into that demographic and have ceo owner something in their job title and are the heads of facebook ad groups and so it's really easy to run in these niches if you're spending one thousand two thousand dollars a day me extremely profitable that's just something you have to keep in mind this works incredibly incredibly well on facebook so i'm saying right now so i'm saying right now that while it's true that you can totally run consulting in sas ads on youtube the easiest place to get started is going to be facebook that's what i've seen many many times that being said if you understand how to tap into and make your ads work on youtube you can run youtube consulting and sas ads just fine i do this all day it's just a bit more challenging and so here's what i suggest you do in this instance if you're in this category if you're in this category right here you're probably already on facebook or if you're thinking about getting started start on facebook to get your copies and your funnel and everything that goes into what you're doing right okay and then what you want to do as soon as you cap out in traffic on facebook because here's what's going to happen when you get the thousand two thousand dollars per day it actually starts to get quite hard to target business owners now i'm not saying you can't do it you can definitely scale further than that but you start facing a lot of resistance and the easiest way to get past this resistance is then take it to youtube take your perfected funnels and then start slapping it on placements start slapping it and really layered intent audiences for example and i'm gonna you should check out our youtube guide that's on the channel i'll link to that below as well that's going to break down intent audiences and scaling and whatnot and what you then do from there is you make those layered intent audiences for example people are in advertising and marketing layered with people that make over 50 000 per year so you don't want to get people that are below that because they obviously aren't business owners and that works really well as well and so if you actually go and look at my youtube ads for hiros let me show you an example you can see down here for hirose we're at about 131 dollars per call and if you come over here to youtube it's a little bit higher but i find the quality is a lot higher okay you can see i'm some of these are really profitable for example this one right here i think we're getting like a 24 cost per call and it did 30 000 roi and just off of like literally in the last uh month right there did 30 thousand dollars roi off of only 20 a day so like it totally works google ads and youtube totally work you can see this one right here this was at eighty dollars a day um it's it twenty six thousand dollars in total sales right there and then that's reoccurring highest it works great um you need to understand that's exactly what i just did on facebook and youtube i went and scaled up on facebook first and as soon as i started seeing the roi start to dip a little bit i also then just take it over to youtube and i perfected the funnels on facebook and just drove them right over to and it works great if you understand how to do that my only suggestion for these type of funnels this is my biggest suggestion for 2021 and yes it's extremely biased but check this out right here so if i go and look at the sales funnel right here it says i got eight calls if i go look at the tracking and google it says i got three i would have shut down this ad and the cost recall is great i have no problem paying 300 per call that's very profitable for us long term that being said if i saw only three calls right here that would mean i'm paying like 500 per call and i would have turned off the ad i would have just shut down this ad right here instantly right here seven calls at 212 dollars a call that's fantastic okay but if i were to cut that in half by the reported four calls right here i would have turned off this ad maybe all right that would take me to 350. if you're running ads like this first off based on these conversions and cost per call it's not accurate so you're just going to be flying all over the place with a sales call funnel or a high ticket funnel it's the most important thing to be tracking this way get wicked reports get high risk set up your own custom thing i don't know what you want to do okay um but more importantly with these type of high ticket funnels as well for consulting just giving you one last piece of advice you need to be looking at the roi because you can see right here uh there's there's ones down here where it has a great cost per call let's go and find one with a really good cost per call really good cost per call no sales coming in right here really good cost per call no sales coming in right here now this is a weird example because i'm pretty sure these will generate sales because i know how to hirose data trends but a lot of people just run based off the cost per call and they're buying all these calls that are really cheap they don't turn in the sales or they're buying all these opt-ins that are really cheap but don't turn the sales and when i was scaling on youtube from about ten to fifteen thousand dollars per day to twenty five thousand dollars i must have wasted at least almost five to ten thousand dollars a day in ad spend sometimes on opt-ins that weren't actually generating sales because i wasn't able to track like this so that's just a bonus tip right there so that guys is my analysis of 2021 and what you need to be looking at based on the business you're in if you're in info marketing get on just do it okay uh if you're an e-commerce think about what type of e-commerce you're doing i'm not saying this other type of e-commerce over here hats maybe like stuff where you can't tie it directly into videos isn't going to work um but if you can tie it in entertainment videos for example if you had like a facial roller device that irons out wrinkles or something like that and you were going and sticking that on makeup and cosmetic video ads that would crush it okay and if you are running a e-commerce object think about like i don't know you ever seen like those john deere tractors if you had something that was like really good like that and you were putting this on farming videos and whatnot where people have to make this large investment you can get people on the phone you can really work with that traffic because just with a little bit of traffic coming in from youtube you can sell you know five thousand ten thousand twenty thousand dollar object from that phone call so if you're paying a hundred dollars per call two hundred dollars per call that's fine finally if you're in consulting what i suggest you do consulting sas start on facebook once you have your stuff working you're going to start hitting a cap because you're not going to be able to scale us further or as far on facebook because what you're doing is you're working with these micro small audiences that are really hard or easy to target on facebook that are really easy to target on facebook and as soon as you start hitting a cap move over to youtube and then start scaling them with each other okay and that will kind of give you your total reach right there so all in all guys this has been the highros train for the day subscribe to this because i'm going to be releasing i think about three to four videos a week right now we're going to be talking about the type of funnels that are working best right now based on all the data i've seen at hiros based on everything i've seen in my experience in the next video so you're probably going to want to see that final just a little call to action that tracking problem i brought up earlier if you want to fix that you can fix that at highrose below by booking a call with us we have a 90 day refund guarantee on it if you don't see the problem fixed and you don't make more from your ads you don't pay that also being said if you want to get on youtube i have the most successful youtube coaching program of all time based on results you can click below and look at the results and you can draw your own conclusion from that if you're interested in those things book a call will help you out other than that thanks for watching hyruleans i'll catch you in the next video this has been alex becker and uh be careful with those bitcoin investments guys invest in your ads much better maybe we'll see in five [Music] years [Applause] foreign

TITLE: 2021 Facebook Ad Targeting (ADVANCED) PT 3
VIDEO ID: UFAhebOBJbI
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFAhebOBJbI
================================================================================

how's it going welcome back to the facebook advanced ad course where i show you everything i've done to scale business past six hundred thousand a month in revenue off of about a hundred thousand a month in ad spend in this video i'm going to be getting into advanced facebook ad targeting which is kind of ironic because if you understand how facebook ad targeting works you can actually scale it really far using chimpanzee level tactics but i'm going to show you the whole nine yards and everything i've used the scale also what i know just is working across the entire industry that being said i'm not going to waste your time because i hate when people waste my time so we're just going to hop straight into this ad targeting lesson i'll just show you everything we're doing and everything i think you should do this will at least help you get a little less confused about scaling ads and hopefully help you scale a metric ton because if you get this going from fifty dollars a day hundred dollars a day five hundred dollars a day a thousand dollars a day so on and so forth not too difficult okay guys so let's talk about facebook targeting and what facebook targeting is more of is less about knowing technical details and hoopla what i see people constantly they're trying to do to either sell their facebook ad services or just because they think this is how you should think about ads is they try to complicate everything they optimize down the demographics they have all these weird little habits like having 50 different ad sets targeting the same campaign the thing you need to understand about ads is that if you're having to get complicated you're being stupid and i'm not doing that to insult anybody that has a phd in complication of ads i'm doing it because that's just the truth because the thing is when you're complicating ads you're trying to make an ad that doesn't work work that's the first thing that's going on right there nobody just ever had an ad that was a home run was like you know what you need to do is make 50 different ad sets targeting the same audience so like the algorithm will like do this weird thing and that's not how it works okay i have ads that generate 10x rois and we have the most basic kindergarten targeting you could possibly imagine and the reason for that is because facebook ads are more about an understanding of how you're reaching the audiences the audiences you are reaching what's going on in the background and more so how the audience changes as you scale up that's the reason why most people get broken is because of a few bad understandings of the ad platform and if you have these understandings you don't have to do complicated stuff and the complicated stuff never works long term anyways so there's no point in doing it so first off the number one thing we need to focus on when it comes to understandings is what's happening okay so let's cover a few things first up how you want to be running facebook audiences is of course there's two types of audiences on facebook there's the interest targeting that you can target and the ad manager and we'll hop into the ad manager and i'll kind of break this down though this isn't a beginner's course okay so i'm not gonna be breaking under the first audience and stuff like that um and it's not interesting it's interest but there's interest-based targeting and then there's going to be look-alike audiences which you're going to be generating based off of the data you collect from people visiting your website opting in buying stuff and then there's also going to be your pixel and your conversion settings that you decide to target i'm going to give you a quick refresher basically what happens is when you run an ad and somebody hits your pixel let's say the person opts in what facebook is going to do is going to fill in that this opt-in looks like this type of person this person has this interest they manage this demographic they're this gender yada yada and it's going to feed the pixel this data and it's going to use that to say this is what this opt-in looks like and if you want to get more customers like it target people like this okay and so if i set the conversion setting inside of my ad to opt-ins and i've fed this pixel right here tons of people who have opted in it's going to then be far more efficient at finding opt-ins for me this type of targeting right here if you're using just a facebook pixel can turn into a whole bag of horribleness because what usually happens is if you don't have proper tracking on the ads and i'm not going to talk about high risk much in this video i promise to you but if you are tracking from ads first off the things that are usually easiest to track like opt-ins aren't actually the best thing to target and then two what is going to be happening is if you're targeting something like a sale a lot of times facebook is going to miss a lot of sales let's say it only catches six out of ten sales that come in and what's gonna happen is this four to ten sales that were missed it's gonna mark these as people it shouldn't target and then it's going to have all sorts of faulty data it's gonna avoid people that it should be targeting and you're just working with six out of 10 pixel optimization instead of 10 out of 10 which if you know how numbers work is usually better but the thing i'm trying to say right here is all these things combine together and we graduate and grow our targeting over time using these things this is what i like to call facebook graduating so what's gonna happen is let's just break this down in three phases just because the highest number i can count two is three when you first start off you're going to be using base audiences and your pixel is not going to be trained and i want to share one thing don't lose your mind over the pixel i've had ad accounts where i don't use any targeting or i use completely untrained pixel i get the same exact results the same exact results as a trained pixel so it varies but we're going to be using base audiences which are going to be interest audiences and i'm just going to refer them as base audiences for now because that's what i just use in my head now we're also going to have a bad pixel that's not trained and so really we're just going to send this fishing rod out into a cold pond of predetermined audiences for us so interest-based audiences would be you know what they are if you're watching this video in your advance if you're not go back in the kiddie pool okay but interest-based audience would be like people that like shopify or people that like tony robbins or something like that that's what they're interested in at least i'm not gonna explain everything that goes into audiences and interest though because again there's tons of kiddie pool videos on youtube this isn't a kiddie pool video now what we're going to do at this point in time is we're going to be feeding this pixel we're also going to be gathering data so let's imagine we're running a webinar in this situation we're writing anything where we have legion and we're sending people to an opt-in they put in their information they end up on a thank you page what we're then going to have is we're going to be able to build up an audience of let's say about 100 people and be able to create a look-alike audience and so then we can transition and graduate to tight look-alike audiences so this would be one percent look-alike audiences so people that facebook will go and generate an audience of a million people um who closely resemble these people that came in and so sometimes you want you can use a hundred people especially if it's buyers if it's opt-ins you probably want more but a hundred people is what you need to really make a decent lookalike audience again you're going to constantly want to be recreating look like audiences as you get more data as well because it's just common sense okay so what we're going to then do with this is again we'll have this one percent audience that looks like people to devops then people that bought our product and whatnot and primarily we'll start off with our weaker lookalike audiences and so that's why we specifically want to use this one percent setting right here because we want to be as close to this as possible but then we'll also have a trained up pixel that is a little bit more competent than this pixel right here and so our targeting will get better as we make it a little bit broader but still very targeted because it's like these this audience right here now what's going to then happen after a while is we're going to have tons of data we're going to have lots of buyers we're gonna have lots of phone calls we have lots of opt-ins and so we're gonna have a lot of data to make a lot of look-alike audiences and of course our best look-alike audience is going to be buyers in theory okay of course it's going to be our best in theory 50 of the time it's your best audience i guarantee it it will work at least 10 percent of the time it's the best thing ever all right so if you get my joke right there we're going to create audiences off of all these things and what we can then do as we train up our pixel to be more accurate is we make these two percent audiences and three percent audiences and two percent audiences and three percent audiences and once you get to three percent audiences you're dealing with audiences like five million people or somewhere around there three to five so that's more than enough for the goal of getting you to five thousand dollars a day ad spend with this video and as we do this of course the pixel is getting more and more data it's getting more data on what a buyer looks like or what an opt-in looks like or what a call looks like and we always really want to optimize for buyers and it depends on the business model you're in for example if you're an e-commerce you should have no problem optimizing for buyers if you're doing a call funnel you it's it's hard to optimize for buyers right away because you need lots of phone calls to finally do that if you're doing a webinar funnel uh or something with a longer call to se or click the sale we're still going to want to optimize for buyers because opt-ins are usually a really poor indicator of who's going to buy just who's going to opt in so people that opt in for free stuff are usually different than people to actually buy stuff so you're going to need to keep that in mind anyways what's going to happen is we can increase our look-alike audiences add more the pixel is going to get warmed up and we're gonna be able to increase the size of the audiences now what i want you to actually do as you do this is once you get to this point right here you should be actually making some pretty decent money and you should be testing this and being somewhat reckless with this so i mean once you get 100 people if you want to make a three percent audience and just go for it by all means do it part of being an advanced facebook ad runner is being willing to test things and lose a little money on some tests but eventually we're going to graduate three percent audiences we really don't even have to do this in some niches we don't have to go as proud like at highros we really don't need to go this broad and we're gonna have a really trained up okay and by the way the best way to train up a pixel to be way more accurate is again to use accurate tracking for example hirose and pass that data back to the pixel so the ai can be 10 times smarter because the facebook tracking isn't accurate i've proven like six other videos this is well known moving on this is what i mean by facebook graduating this is what i'm referred to in this video and that's the type of targeting you want to use now we can always use base audiences we can't always stick to our one percent audiences we can also use a three percent audiences you don't need to kill these things as you grow them either okay thing is base audiences can be somewhat hard to scale because they're a little bit less targeted but as your pixel gets more trained you can use all of these pretty efficiently okay but you're not gonna be able to jump straight into a three percent audience with an untrained pixel in theory you can try it and it's worked for me in the past but i just want you to know my train of thought now here's a much more important understanding this is why people do complicated stuff because they're stupid you have to understand that as your expand you have to understand this as you increase your ad spend your audiences expand so if i take an audience from 100 to a thousand dollars a day you have to understand with like a look-alike audience of one percent that's a million people you're not gonna you're not gonna cap that out you're not gonna be running in the ad fatigue with that unless you're spending a ton of money every single day especially when you get into three percent audiences of three to five million and what happens is people start scaling their ads they think they're hitting ad fatigue or some mystical beast is requiring them to do more complicated things because they're getting great uh conversion ratios and cost per sale or cost per opt-in at a hundred dollars a day and as they get to a thousand dollars a day on an ad set it all just goes to hell and what you need to understand is that when you're spending 100 a day 50 bucks a day on an ad set what is happening is facebook is going micro targeted with your audience and it's targeting people that are baby level easy to convert but as your ad spend grows if you want to scale you start targeting people that are more broad this is why you have to understand the market size and the type of product and offer you're making like i talked about in the past few months because if you want to scale at any level you can't live in the baby pool facebook you can live in the baby pool facebook and be very profitable but you'll never scale okay you're never going to have a giant business and that's because you're playing on easy mode right here you got to think about the difficulty to convert people as you scale this up an audience at 100 a day has nothing to do with an audience at a thousand dollars a day okay and then making 10 audiences at 100 a day is not a way to make an audience that's a thousand dollars a day that's not how you scale either that's just how you make things complicated and stupid because eventually these same people start getting the same ads over and over again and then like it starts branching out it just gets confused and it doesn't work okay so you have to understand that when you're going from a hundred a thousand dollars a day on an ad set or any type of ad spend you start seeing all your numbers start going up it's not a sign that you're hitting ad fatigue dude there's like a billion people on facebook there's five million people in your audience i spent nearly a thousand dollars yesterday on this ad set only reached 10 000 people reach-wise okay that's people skimming past it it's people skimming past it that's not a person actually sitting down and like looking at it it would take me literally two three ten thousand dollars a day to even be cracking any type of ad fatigue where a person sing the ad over and over and over again it's not happening to you that's happening and it's not happening what's happening is your ad sucks and it's not positioned in the market well enough this is why most people's ads die on youtube and facebook all the time inside of my ad mastermind iron whenever i'm working with people inside there they always think that their ads are hitting ad fatigue and it's not it's because they need to reposition their offer restructure their offer to work for a more broad audience or if you have a very high ticket offer make it more high ticket and work with these micro audiences because this is how you decide to make the big bucks with the micro audiences by having a very high ticket offer and sometimes audiences are not going to be this big okay they're not going to be this big and so you need to be able to work in this area right here so that's what you need to understand and what's happening right here as you're going up and doing this facebook is having to get more and more expanding with the people targets and thus your number is going to increase if your ads are not good enough if your offer is not positioned well that will also destroy it as well that's what's happening so what audiences do you start off with on facebook well there's two types of different targetings you're going to want to use there's going to be b2b and super high ticket call based targeting and there's going to be more mass market targeting which is going to be your e-commerce or mass-market info offers okay um and this is just what i've seen countless times again in my ad mastermind i just really give people my targetings that i'm using let people look over my shoulder but i'm just gonna do the best i can for you right here okay because i'm not gonna dig into my ad account and share that on youtube with tens of thousands of people so look mass market audiences you're going to want to target your competitors if you can find them on there so for example if you are selling a software that helps people with their businesses maybe use salesforce or something like that you're going to want to use similar brands so for example if you were selling like a make money online course you could use something like tony robbins okay so that's like that's not technically a competitor but he's in self-help so you could use that as a targeting you can also use tools people use that would represent their interests so for example a person's in the e-commerce you could target their interests as shopify okay so these are going to be the three ones that you want to use there's there's tons more you can use magazines and whatnot but this is really where you're going to get the best bang for your buck nine out of 10 times if you want to use other interest if you're watching this video you're not a kiddie pool marketer you're more than welcome to that's what i use your direct competitors similar brands that have like similar people in them and then the tools people use and that's what i use for mass market b2b is very similar it's very similar as in you can transfer these audiences over but one thing that also helps a whole lot is you start throwing in job titles or positions or their facebook page admin status okay so if you want to go in there and you throw everybody that has ceo owner entrepreneur ad manager in their job title you can easily do that in the job title targeting for b2b targeting and this will help you just a wee bit again i've had great success just transferring these over uh dodo version and using it for b2b as well but that also helps as well so i want to include it in there so what you do is you layer it with job titles positions and then you can also target people that own are admins of facebook groups and those are usually going to be people that might be entrepreneurs or business owners or something like that this is what works very very very well now do you want to go in there and play the demographics and whatnot usually the facebook optimization is going to handle that for you and as long as you're aware of the ad positioning that i talked about in the last video okay not running an ad that has a bad headline in the sidebar that doesn't work for sidebars you're going to do just fine this is what i'll use and then what we do so then the next thing we're going to want to do is we're going to want to set our pixel targeting and so here's where you're going to want here's what you're going to want to do for e-commerce or anything where you get a quick sale you want to just optimize it for the sale now for webinars and sales call funnels you want to split test it okay you should honestly just try optimizing for the call if you're doing a call funnel right away or the sale if you're doing a webinar funnel now here's the goofy wonky thing if i go and flip on my hi-ros data and again my job in in this video is not to push hiros on you i just i think it's absolutely crazy to be running a webinar or a call funnel especially or any type of funnel but especially those ones without proper tracking because you can see right here it literally does not catch the calls half the time you got a call coming in right here it didn't catch it got two calls coming in right here didn't catch it and more importantly we have sales coming in here and what i like to optimize for a lot of times is sales because the sale is what actually matters i can get tons of cheap calls but people who are cheap callers aren't people that routinely buy that's incredibly important when it comes to doing or tracking or optimizing any calls and it's nearly like facebook literally will not track sales for webinars or sales call funnels long term webinar funnels like good luck you'll catch like 30 50 of them call funnels you're not gonna catch any of them and so first off you want to pass this data back to facebook and optimize around this because obviously it's better to optimize around the two calls that came in instead of zero calls that were reported right here same thing going on right here that's gonna allow us to optimize better and have better pixel targeting on top of that we just won't literally kill ads that are literally generating calls for us i would have turned this ad off right here i would have turned this ad off right here and this ad literally generated me five thousand dollars for like 19 phone call i would have literally turned this ad off right here so not only would it make me make stupid decisions it's also optimizing around goofy data that isn't going to help me okay and you're going to run into the same exact thing with google ads as well and so it's very hard to optimize for calls and sales on any type of funnel with this type of data you're even going to see an e-commerce or short click to sale funnels okay and so i wanted to point that out you want to optimize for the call or sale on a webinar funnel or a call funnel because these are the people that actually buy people that opt-in are people that opt-in for free stuff okay that's like if you were selling cheese at a grocery store and you're optimizing for people to take free samples well people that take free samples aren't necessarily going to be the people that buy the cheese what you want to do is give free samples to people that are likely to buy the cheese that's how you optimize the free samples okay we could get like 50 cent opt-ins with people that have no chance of buying or calling same thing with e-commerce okay you can feed the data right back to your pixels well on facebook and you want to do that because again you're only going to catch like 70 of your sales in e-commerce usually that's what we see and if you have cross traffic going on with like google and organic stuff running oh my gosh all right so i'm just not even going to talk about that anymore because it frustrates me and if you're not doing that and you're running a serious ad funnel you're being an ad goblin okay just one of those crazy little things from lord of the rings it just has trash everywhere and it's just like eating bugs and stuff i don't know how to help you now then at that point we're going to try and get 100 of anything okay because the issue i brought up with optins doesn't apply to making a look-alike audience you could make a look-like audience of a hundred opt-ins okay so you make it look like audience of that at one percent or in e-commerce you can go make a look-alike audience of people that clicked your ad you can test that out look like audience out might not be the best one but you can definitely make a look like onto your first hundred sales once you have that you're really in a good spot in e-commerce and then we're just gonna keep going and keep making larger look-alike audiences based on all of our data so you're eventually gonna have a hundred opt-ins you're gonna have 100 calls you're gonna have 100 buyers so on and so forth you want to do that for either type of these so what we can do then is we make a one percent lookalike audience of our calls and then of our buyers and we can slowly just start upgrading these audiences to two percent and three percent especially as we start getting past like five hundred dollars a day on any of these audiences five hundred to a thousand dollars a day you're going to start hitting a little bit of pushback especially in info marketing e-commerce maybe not so much because you can go way broader with e-commerce on but same exact thing you would just want to make look-alike audiences of your buyers go one percent to two percent to three percent and then you can really start cracking out to the five or ten percent if you have a mass-market product and that's literally all you need to do i i told you this is kindergarten easy there isn't really that much to do after you understand what's going to be happening the main thing you need to look out for as as you start growing this when you go from 100 a day to a thousand dollars a day understand that these ads down here that are meant for a micro market and if they work for the micro market doesn't mean they're gonna work for the larger market when you get to a thousand dollars a day because again facebook has to go and expand what it's looking at this is one of the reasons why people have such trouble on youtube ads if you ever watch the youtube ads course uh that i've also released on here 100 free better than anything you can buy as well that's why most people get messed up in youtube whenever people come into our ad mastermind for youtube ads which if you're interested in that you can get details on that below i'll hop on a call with you and we can talk about your ads and what you've got going on and i'll help you out with that but more importantly when they come in the problem is there's no hundred dollars a day level at youtube okay you go straight into this thousand dollar a day blue ocean kind of thing and or ocean kind of thing and so you need to be able to make a broad ad right away and most people are so used to this area and facebook and they try and take this over here and it doesn't work but it's also the same thing that messes people up when they go on facebook ads because they try and take this type of ad and take it over here and they're like what's my targeting no it's not you can use look like audiences tell kingdom come so that being said guys that is what i use when it comes to facebook ad targeting two things look guys if you're watching this at this point i can't stress enough how important tracking is i made it very clear when it comes in terms of your ai and making scaling decisions so far i would really suggest that you go below if you're thinking about running ads seriously or you are running ads seriously and just book a high ros consultation if you do not see huge tracking results and make your ads more profitable and save you a ton of money and make your ai more optimized you literally do not pay no money okay there's we have a 90-day guarantee if people don't see results at scale their ads they don't pay so the worst thing that could happen if you go and book that consultation and come on the hi-ros your your ads stay where they're at right now the best thing that happened is you're suddenly like oh wait now i don't have to like make stupid ad and i will stop killing ads that are making me money and wasting money on ads that aren't and optimizing my ai off of goblin data on top of that if you would actually like help with your ads you'd like to see my actual ad targetings i'm using actually get guidance and whatnot go below and just book a consultation with me below and we will actually just go into your ad account and talk about how you can be scaling your type of offer uh primarily on facebook and youtube ads where youtube is a little bit of my speciality but as you can see i'm pretty damn confident in facebook as well and more so talk about how you can position your offer how you should structure your funnels and how you should really approach your market which is far more important to and youtube if you're interested in that just go below and schedule a consultation with me on top of that go and check out the hi-ros facebook group on facebook just go into the search bar type in hi-ros you should see hi-ros forum pop-up it has over 50 million dollars a month in media buyers in it meaning our members spend at least 50 million dollars a month combined on ads there is a qualification to join you have to be spending a significant amount of ad spend but if you can get in there it is the best group for media buyers online that being said also subscribe this video because we're not even done releasing this facebook

TITLE: ADVANCED 2021 Facebook Ads Guide PT 2 : How To Write HIGH Converting Ad Copy
VIDEO ID: 3_sGzvFrTLg
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_sGzvFrTLg
================================================================================

you welcome back to the facebook advanced ad course basically where i'm sharing everything i've done the scale business past six hundred thousand dollars per month of about a hundred thousand dollars a month in ad spend in this video i'm going to be getting into facebook ad copy basically everything i've learned about it and everything i think will work regardless of what niche you're in again you might be wondering why am i doing this well what i like to do whenever i nail down an ad platform i like to make a super advanced course in it just like our youtube ad course where i scale the business past a million dollars a month you should check that one out if you get bored too that being said i don't want to waste your time because i hate when people waste my time so just hop straight into it i want to show you what i think is the best ad copy and at least one of the highest performing ways to write your ads on facebook so uh all right everyone welcome back to the whiteboard of truth and justice it's ugly it's bad the presentation value is less than five dollars but this is basically where every major ad discovery in the history of man has ever been discovered so you're welcome this is what genius looks like i'm done making jokes let's actually talk about ad copy all right so look the first three things i want to teach you and the biggest thing about ad copy is actually not doing stupid things and i'm going to show you my three highest converting types of ad copy but they're not going to work if you do stupid things because if you do stupid things usually you get bad results and these are the stupid things i see chronically all right so here's stupid thing number one look at this sidebar ad right here legend london dot co it's got the shirt off what what and what gravy's name is going on right here what is this selling what is this doing rule number one the ad copy is it has to make some form of sense if you're putting ads up and they're going in the sidebar or they're going on instagram and parts of the ad are missing that are not missing on other parts of the ad for example this is obviously meant to run in the news feed they probably description or something with the ad what will make sense well if you're doing that that's stupid it's stupid as much as facebook is going to optimize your ads it's not going to out optimize stupidity this right here driving sales driving traffic but no sales we're in an ant techs get 300 credits i don't know what they're selling right here i don't know what they're selling right here and this is a tic tac ad tick talk ad tic tac tic tuck i don't you see the kids posting their faces and dances on there and i'm glad i'm not 15 anymore those people are terrifying anyways look check out the difference with this ad so check this out right here this is what's going to look like in the sidebar at least somewhat like that this added a drops add costs 52 in some case studies we have this guy holding this little chip so what's going on here is this the only way you should design your ads no no but i have ads that are specifically made for the sidebar i have ads that are specifically made for instagram because you're going to see dramatically different displays on different networks look at this right here there's no headline okay so this ad right here where you see this headline right here this big sexy headline that gets a juice it's not going to do as well on instagram because if you run ads in 2020 and you're not using ai tracking script you're at a huge disadvantage you cuts off if i want to run this on instagram i want to put a headline right here something that tells them what they're going to get if they click and then get everything before this more thing because we all know people on instagram they're not there to read all right they're there to look at kylie jenner's butt and so that being said you know you got to distract them from that thing okay so what you need to do is you need to go and really hit them hard with an instagram ad this wouldn't work well on instagram very very important you need to design your ads for the platform they're going to be on but you're going to think whoa to put the most possible place yes but you can get an absolutely great return if you optimize for instagram only and then you could really crush it not only in the news feed but then also on instagram and then also in the sidebar you can actually do fantastic in the sidebar area because everybody's ads look like this because everyone's a goof troop and tries to run the same exact ad on every single place ad copy 101 don't be a freaking idiot okay don't be a goof troop don't be a pressed ham next the goal of the ad is to click so what i see people trying to do is i see them try and make the sale and the ad so they have like a long winded video they have a long text and don't get me wrong there's a place in time and i'm sure you whoever you followed in ads is like what you want to do you want to write a story that convinces the person to change their life and no you you goof what you want to do is you want to get the person to click the damn ad so then you can actually grind on them because guess what's happening when a person is going through their news feed okay i have all my news feed blocked because i'm smart and i don't use social media but we're selling the people like you who watch social media videos i love you please keep using social media i need you to look at my ads but look when i'm going through my ads you can see this ad right here actually has a very long-winded copy it is it is a it is a storybook of why you should use ai tracking with your ads by the way you want to know why you should use ai tracking with your ads here's a bunch of call funnels okay so check this out i'm using hi-ros it's obviously as you know i'm the ceo of pyro some wee bit bias but i'm also this weird type of crazy person that actually likes to scale their ads based on accurate data because what happens if you scale your ads based on inaccurate data and in la la land data that isn't actually real you get la la land money which isn't isn't accepted at whole foods you can't spend it there okay so i like to work with real numbers so i can actually make real money you can see right here with the calls that came in right here first off hyrus caught seven calls you might be wondering was facebook agreed with the trucking is it just missing stuff i can go through and find every single little call that comes into my business and i can see every single click the person's done okay i can see this person i've been tracking them all this away since july to their click here on to their click here in october every single call that comes to my business is attributed not being said there's seven calls reported right here facebook reported 11 because it gives itself all sorts of wonky view through conversions and weird other conversions you can also see it here there's actually a call that came in right here facebook reported no nothing came in and then facebook isn't even able to track the call conversions on the phone and actual numbers if a person comes back and buys one two days later forget about it and then we're not even operating around profit which if you're running ads and you're not operating around your actual accurate roi you're a goblin i don't know what's going on stop doing it no matter ad copy is going to allow you to escape being irresponsible with your ad spend and not working off of accurate numbers and accurate data literally the same exact thing is going on in adwords if you go right here reported i got five calls actually had six report i had one i had two reported ad four i had seven if i'm going off this data right here i'm gonna be turning off my best ad sets and if you're doing that you're just goblin level ad running and you can have great copy but if you're turning off ads that are making you money or investing in ads that literally aren't making any money or getting you a bad cost per call or bad cost per sale dude stop it just stop you don't have to do that just book an analysis call with hyrus below and we'll just literally fix it for you in seconds but that being said getting back on topic the goal of an ad if you looked at that last ad i showed you i have this giant giant copy inside of it okay giant amount of copy but the goal is not to get someone to read or be sold on the ad the goal of the ad is to get them to click with intent and curiosity that's the goal a lot of people will say hey just get the click or a lot of people will try and sell it in the ad that's not what you want to do there because when a person is skimming through facebook they're at whole foods looking at your ad while also looking at a candy bar or they're walking around or they're sitting at their house watching pewdiepie i don't know but they're not in a phase where they can be actively convinced or sold to they can be curiosity peaked and you can start a trigger or a behavior train which is basically where the person clicks and out of curiosity and they're more likely to do the next thing and they're more likely the next thing if i have an ad right here that says click for cat pictures and a person clicks the ad they're not going to respond the way i want on the next page if i put something that says this add ai drops ad cost 52 which it does you should probably use it but the next thing i want them to do if i want to become a high-risk customer is that opt-in to watch a video on this so the next page they go to they're super interested in how this works so what then happens is this peaks their curiosity if they read the subscription right here they get primed to opt in i don't tell them the answer i don't tell them what they're going to get i make them go holy moly i really need to know what this is if i want to move forward in whatever i'm trying to do in my life and this heavily applies to the goal that's very important to me but i'm not selling them or convincing them to use tracking this ad i'm convincing them that they're at a big disadvantage if they're not using this thing i'm talking about then they click the ad and then they're more inclined to opt in and then behave the way i want them to that's what you want to do you don't want to get them to buy you don't want to convince them to change their life here you want to convince them that they need what is going to be on the other side of this page they need to take the next action and what i mean by need to take the next action is we don't say click this add to opt-in no they need to complete whatever happens next in page whatever it is because they're missing this thing in their life that's what you're trying to achieve with the ad copy finally what you need to understand about when you test ad copy is what facebook is going to do is it's not going to run your ads based on which one gets you the most sales and whatnot at least in theory sometimes it works out like that but what it's going to do is it's also going to look at a bunch of factors that don't really have to do with your sales like which one gets the best interaction rate and engagement right that's not always the one that gets you the best results when it comes to sales so what you want to do when you split test your ads is you want to go and make a testing campaign okay and what you want to do in each campaign is you want to have the same exact audience maybe put twenty dollars a day on each audience five ad sets targeting the same audience at 20 days then put five different ads across all those ad sets so if you have five ads one ad in each ad set that is a tongue twister but what you should have is five ad sets and one ad in each ad set that's different and that's how you split test it because it's going to show you your best opt-in rate and your best metrics and that's going to tell you which ad is working the best these are just three fundamental things that people mess up and when you mess these things up you're doing stupid things and you're not going to have good ad results and i want you to have good ad results so that when you scale your ads and you're making a ton of money you're like well i'm losing a ton of money because i'm not tracking my ads right maybe i should use hiros stop being a goblin so let's talk about my three types of ads that i basically run so the first type of ad copy that i run is actually quite simple it's called the peak and click so what i'm going to do right here is i'm going to use curiosity peaking images so check out this image right here these are very simple ads and what i'm going to do is i'm going to try to run ads that look native like a news source so you can see right here this ad ii drops ad costs 52 in some case studies and i have a picture of this woman with tattoos and i have this little chip right here and so what i find works exceptionally well is when you have someone holding something that's weird or you have something that looks weird and is unexplained a lot of people put pictures of like liver or like they used to one thing that used to kill on facebook is people put pictures of like raw eggs and like funny formations and people like what is that now that is spammy you want to have something that ties into this and looks like something someone would put on a new site if you have a picture of yourself next to you in a suit holding crossing your arms no you look like a goober who's trying to sell something on facebook if you have this picture right here it looks like something interesting is happening in the world of technology with combo this with this headline it seems like hmm if you don't read this you're going to be missing out in the world of technology and so what i want to do with these types of ads right here is i want to pique their interest and trigger fomo specifically that's one of my biggest strategies when it comes to anything i'm selling you want to make people particularly feel like they're missing out if they don't know what's going on combine it with the image it catches their attention and a headline that makes them feel like that you're going to get the click now remember you can't just put something like hey people that don't eat this foods head explode all right you'll get a lot of clicks but it doesn't make any sense what's going to happen on the next page it has to relate in what you're doing i'm selling technology and tracking so i want people who are interested in their ads interested in their ad cost to feel like they're missing out and they're not on the cutting edge of technology this gets them to come on to the next page and fomo triggers them and gets them to opt in and go through the rest of the sales funnel fomo is the most powerful thing you can use when you're writing very quick gimmick ads like this i get a click that's relevant because again the criteria is right here ad ai drops ad costs no person who's interested in losing weight is going to click this ad people that are interested in saving money on their ads right away they're going to click this ad because they feel like they're missing out this is the first type of ad copy okay and the most important thing to understand about facebook ad copy as well is i really don't care what's below this fold right here i know some people that will preach and they write their life biography right here most people are going to read this part of the ad they're going to read this part of the ad and they're going to look at the image and click okay so it's very important that you get all your message in before the see more part right here you want to put it in mobile variation and i go and always end it with a here's why or keep reading at this point because yeah this is some good copy right here however the key to it is if you run ads in 2020 you're not using ai tracking scripts you're simply at a huge disadvantage people want to know more i want to see what's going on here so the next type of ad right here is more of a traditional ad something you're probably used to and seeing in the internet marketing world this ad right here which hannaf mohadi absolutely hates you can see the angry emoji right here so here's how you make good video ads make sure the thumbnail i'm using the same exact strategy with the image ad i showed you people like what's going on right here and i put this ai script as the biggest edge in page ads people want to know what's going on right here okay again when you're running video ads make sure to put captions on because people don't turn on sound they just sit there like a brain dead goblin and they read the text i do the same thing i'm a goblin in every four in my life all right so i don't expect other people not to be so what's going to go on in this ad right here is again it's just straight up fomo and what you want to do on videos is a lot of people for example i saw this one person let's just say selling like a youtube or ad consulting course or something like that the person in the video makes this huge case that youtube or facebook ads or their ad strategy the new way to go things are changing like look at my ad manager these are the strategies they're working in 2020 that's not what i want to achieve i want the person to click the ad and go man this guy has something that i need really badly and i want to get them the knee jerk do what i want them to do on the next page and so what i have right here is i'm not telling them about how tracking changes the world or how it's going to improve their scale or how that they're going to see more accurate data in their ad managers it's too much for them to comprehend what i tell them is if you click on the next page i'm going to give you a script that's going to help you save 52 on your ads they click on the next page it says how we use print tracking and ai to save 52 percent of our ads opt-in people go okay that's what i came for that's the thing that their interest they opt in and then they see a sales video that actually does the grinding and the working on explains how sales tracking scripts combined with ai actually do save money on ads and i'm able to actually lay out and hit them with a message because they're not scrolling through instagram they're not scrolling through youtube anymore so what you want to do when you're running these types of video ads especially when you're doing info marketing you want to find the one thing people really care about and what people really care about when it comes to tracking is instantly getting customers much cheaper and so the whole entire ad focuses on if you pay attention to what i'm saying i will give you this thing that gives you that exact result that you want to get and the reason why this result works is because tons of other people say it works look at all these other people that have gotten this result and if you click this ad i will give you the same exact thing that got these people to result okay so that's the format that i use over and over again with my video make sure you have a big enticing headline that matches that strategy i talked about the images go straight into it say look this thing is getting this result that's super important to you and if you don't have this you're missing out you're spending way more money than you should you're doing this x y z thing that causes pain i know this sounds ridiculous but here's tons of other people that have gotten the same exact result and if you click this ad i will give you this exact thing and show you exactly how to use it to get this result click this ad leaves a person with one thing in mind they have the key result that they want which is all you can hook them on you're not going to sell them on a new theory of life they click on the ad they have massive curiosity and they're inclined to do what you want them to do on the next page i want them to opt in so i can really work on them retargeting wise because that's a whole other video you should check out my retargeting video on this channel because that's a whole other beast of a game but that's what i'm trying to do with this type of ad the final type of ad that i like to run is a specific type of retargeting ad and i just want to show you because it's important so when i run retargeting ads again watch my retargeting video on this channel because there's like a zillion other things that i do but one of the things i find is super useful as i make funny retargeting ads why because when people see retargeting ads that they don't care most retargeting ads are like you sitting in there saying like hey you watched my video training and you should be interested in my thing why did you leave i'm so mad and if you want to schedule they didn't schedule call because they didn't like you in the first place okay they didn't they weren't interested and approaching them with like another straight up repeat of what you just said works retargeting wise but if you want to make it better i make funny ads okay i make funny ads that catch your attention make them laugh a little bit and then say hey come on back because we're not trying to convince them to do something again we're trying to get their attention and get them to come back best way to get someone's attention is give them something funny people like reading funny things and so i have all sorts of goofy goofy ads would i retarget people with like mecha reagan raven finds your lack of tracking disturbing people go what's that oh that's that brand with that tracking thing and they're like you know they do get results and then they come on back and then i can work on them again through a sales video we don't want to resell them right here because again you cannot sell to someone who's already on facebook they're doing other things and there's like 16 other things literally scientifically designed to get their attention why would you ever try to make your sales pitch when when the person's being distracted that's like literally trying to go on a date with a girl well there's like 16 other guys all like throwing roses in her face and buying her our drink and then there's just like a chimpanzee screaming in her ear you're probably not it's probably not the next best way to meet your wife that's what i'm trying to say so tip if you're going on hinge or bumble dates try to do it in a room where there isn't 16 other gentleman suitors and by all means avoid that monkey okay that'll lead to a really awkward date and that will probably be feces thrown so that is the lesson for today guys if you like these lessons subscribe to this channel because i'm completing this facebook series and i'm releasing a new video almost every two to three days on this two track your ads you should do it if you're scaling your ads at all and you want to set up that tracking i showed you early video go below this video just track a consultation we'll show you exactly how it works show you where you're losing a ton of money in your ads show you where you can scale and the way high-risk works is if you don't see the results that help you scale make a lot more money you don't pay so you should check it out because the worst thing that could happen is you stop running goblin ads and actually run with accurate data finally if you're interested in that ad mastermind i talked about you can book a call with me below i'll go through your ads we'll analyze your ads look at them i'll show you where you can probably grow the type of funnels you should be running the targeting you should be using and how to tweak your offers absolute crushing on facebook and youtube yeah again this is for both these are for super experienced business owners if you're a complete beginner use this course okay use this course if you're not making twenty thousand a month you're not spending ten fifteen thousand a month at least on ads don't go don't don't do those things it's not for beginners it's not some quick way to make money online that also being said go to facebook look for the hiroz facebook group just type hyrus in and if you spend money on ads a significant amount of money you can join the group we have over 50 million dollars a month in media buying spent across all our members on there because we require people to come in and actually be media buyers best ad group you're going to find online because we actually have people that actually spend money on ads that being said stay tuned i'm going to be releasing the next video here in a few days subscribe so you see that because if you miss it it's a good one it's gonna be a doozy i'm going through all my targeting and all the targeting you should be using when you're about to start up and when you're about to scale so stay tuned for that and i'll see in the next video [Music] [Applause]

TITLE: 2021's #1 Killers Of Facebook Ad ROI
VIDEO ID: 4ySQQ-ovDCg
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ySQQ-ovDCg
================================================================================

this video is going to cover why your facebook ads stop working and why they stop scaling and why when you always get to a certain point or after a certain amount of time they suddenly get more expensive or you suddenly can't scale any further look at highrose i see all the data coming in through all sorts of businesses through their ads and whatnot well i will never share any of that i can show you most of the time why ads are not growing more importantly i can identify from my own experience of growing multiple businesses past eight figures with ads working with businesses doing that there's usually about four things that happen that are the reason why ad stops scaling and it has nothing to do with the ad targeting it has nothing to do with the ad copy it has nothing to do even with the funnel has an understanding of how the ads are working with the audiences on facebook and if you understand this well this is how you take your ads from struggling the past two thousand dollars a day an ad spend to going well past five thousand ten thousand dollars a day this works also on google this works on facebook this works on pinterest ads it doesn't matter it's the same concept across all of them and that's what i'll show you today from my personal experience and from all my experience with working with so many different clients and tracking at house now you're probably wondering alex why are you telling me this why are you giving me all this information it's simple i want you to scale your ads because when you scale your ads up and make more money you're going to need to track it to keep scaling further and when you get to that point you're probably gonna think hmm that ceo at hyrus he helped me out maybe i'll track my ads with hiros because that will help me make a lot more revenue and save a ton of money so i can scale more efficiently that's all so i want you to get to that point so maybe you'll track with us that being said let's hop into it i want to show you these four things because if you can just nail these down this is going to reverse the whole entire rubik's cube puzzle that is facebook ads youtube ads and allow you to scale well infinitely higher okay guys so unlike our other trains which you can also see all over the channel like last week i showed a bunch of different hacks will just immediately increase your facebook ad roi and even on youtube as well a lot of those trainings were in the ad manager we're getting pretty in-depth today is more about an understanding of what's going on with targeting see what most people do when they're trying to scale their ads is they think the secret to why their ads are not making money is the targeting and this is just the furthest thing from the truth targeting is the easy part of ads if you are your ads are not working it's not because you're not using targeting right it's because you're not understanding how the targeting works and what you should be selling to specific targetings and at scale how you should be selling to large groups of people or smaller groups of people or certain markets it's a complete misunderstanding of market size and what the market should be being sold that's usually why people's ads die for example inside of my youtube and facebook ad consulting program iron i'm constantly sharing all my split tests my exact targeting my funnels everything has been working for my business and i'm not trying to push this to you here what i'm trying to tell you is that when i see people come in the program and triple forex their businesses 5x their businesses and again this is people that are actual business owners they're actually running ads these are not beginners coming in and blowing up a business i want to be very clear there but when people come in there it's almost never targeting i give people my exact targeting which isn't that complicated and their business takes off and grows not because of the ad target it grows because they position the right offer to the right market and the right broadness of targeting so targeting is never going to be your solution that is something that ad gurus are going to tell you because they want you to think it's some complicated solution you'll never understand it's never the targeting i spent i've scaled my ads to 25 000 a day on youtube i've skilled fifteen thousand dollars a day on facebook and it's been done using the most simplest targeting look-alike audiences on facebook the word money the word money on youtube worked exceptionally well for me at chimpanzee can do that level of targeting what a chimpanzee cannot do is what i'm about to show you right here see whenever you're selling to a marketplace there's four different levels in the marketplace especially when it comes to bdb which is what most people watching this channel sell but this applies ecommerce supplies anything so let's imagine this marketplace right here is 10 000 people and we're selling real estate coaching we're showing people how to make money in real estate just an easy niche for me to explain it in i actively don't do this niche or anything like that but it's the same across every niche out there so you have to understand that the first layer of this audience is a very very small layer of people that are actually making money and are actively participating in real estate and making anywhere from 50 to anywhere actually any amount of money in real estate okay out of all the people inside this entire marketplace there's probably about 200 of these people and this 10 000. next the next layer of people is people that actively want to start doing real estate they might be making a little bit of money but not fifty thousand or just sort of getting into and they they've chosen like i want to do real estate i want to do some real estate marketing this would only be maybe another 500 people and so if we're looking at the true b2b potential of this marketplace right here it's extremely small and i'll get into why this is important here in a second but if we look at the rest of the marketplace the next audience size right here is people that just want to start a business they're committed to actually going and becoming entrepreneurs and making their own business and so this might be another 2 000 people in the marketplace and in the final rest of the marketplace right here the about i don't know 7 000 rest of them are people that just simply want more money these are people who want more money and so what happens here's where most people get crushed and this applies to any business that's out there if you don't get this gap this is why you get messed up is people try and take this offer right and sell it to these people right here when you're trying to scale up and go broad you're going to quickly get into this area because if you're spending ten thousand bucks a day there is not enough people who are actively making money in real estate for ten thousand dollars a day an ad spend to be deployed it's just not you're going to have to separate across many different platforms and many different different promotional methods and so this doesn't work right here and this is why most people ads die because they go and take this off right here they position it pretty cheaply like one thousand to two thousand dollars and then they try and scale it and sell it to a mass market that doesn't work or what they try and do is they try and take a mass market product about making more money in real estate in general and sell it to a person that is already making substantial money in real estate they don't want to buy that they want to buy the next thing up and so what happens is people either try and take a 1 000 to 2 000 offer that's designed for this marketplace and bring it to these people well there's not enough people in this marketplace right here to support that if i sold you would run out of all 200 of these people very quickly the same thing happens on facebook and youtube ads on the flip side you can't take this offer right here which is ten thousand dollars and sell to this marketplace right here and on the flip side this offer right here which would be if we were making an offer specifically for these people would be how to grow your real estate business that you're already making money in won't work in this marketplace right here and this is where most people's ads die because they try and take this offer this marketplace this marketplace to this marketplace it doesn't work like that you need to say who am i targeting am i targeting b2b which is people that are actively involved in something or am i targeting people with more base needs am i targeting the mass market and you need to understand that that's who you're selling to and you're not selling anybody else this is the number one reason why ads die because what happens when you first start up your ads your ads are very micro targeted and this works great if you're in b2b where there's a micro audience for example people that actually actively own a dental office but the problem is with micro targeting there's not enough traffic to actively support massive skill so you have to sell very expensive offers an offer that's five thousand ten thousand twenty five thousand dollars because then you can scale that you either have to have a really deep backend or a very expensive offer this is where most people make a lot of money doing this because if you understand the audience is small you can stick to micro targeting and you don't have to scale very far to make a lot of money as soon as you start scaling out on facebook as soon as you start getting past a thousand two thousand dollars per day you start branching off into a very broad audience of people these are people with very base simple needs and you need to understand that a lot of people will try and take a middle ground offer that plays to both audiences at the same time and scale that and it won't work because the middle ground offer is not expensive enough to be supported by the micro audiences but it's also not positioned well enough to work with the base audiences for example the base audiences don't want a real estate course they want a way to make money quickly without effort and this applies to anything weight loss home improvement whatever okay you get from people that just want a push button solution you need to be convinced to get started on a path whereas you have people that are already far down the path you need to sell them completely different things at completely different price points and so what happens right here is when people go and they usually start with their base offers or base offers they sell a 1 000 to 2 000 offer that works at these micro audiences but won't scale because they can't make enough money at the micro audiences and so they try and scale it large they try and scale it to a mass audience and it doesn't work because the mass audience doesn't want to buy that and then the the micro audience also doesn't want to buy it either so they end up in this weird limbo where their ads don't make an roi and so that's the first thing you need to understand who am i going to sell to and what is my scale going to look like for example at harvest our ads are extremely profitable but we're not scaled very far because we target ad runners that's a very small audience sometimes the audience and marketplace you're selling to isn't that large and so you need to focus on instead making exxon offers that you can charge extremely high prices for and so that's the biggest mistake i see number one but the next thing i also see is not understanding how other your competitors back ends work so with a lot of times with your ads let's say you're running a funnel that requires you to pay ten dollars for a person to come in well as you scale up the increase or the the because of the broadness of your targeting the amount you're gonna have to pay is going to increase you're gonna get from ten dollars to fifteen dollars to 20 eventually that's gonna become too much for you and the reason why is because the person that's making this get up to twenty dollars like somebody's willing to pay that amount for the lead is probably one of your competitors as a super deep back-end so for example the time in my consulting group iron what i'll see all the time is i'm going to see people they start seeing their cpl going up they're cost to get a lead in and then they just can't do it anymore and they're like how do i how do i make this work and their funnel and everything is optimized they've copied everything i've done we've shared we've gone into everything they're doing it's just not going to happen so the way that they actually make this work is you need to go and say okay cool i got a i got a 2 000 off right here we need to have a deeper backend because for example if you look at any of the largest businesses in any space you look at the real estate coaching space you look at the e-commerce space you look in weight loss pace doesn't matter the largest businesses usually don't make money on their front end they usually lose money getting a customer in the door for example i was looking at a huge self-help guru and he spends about three months of what a customer spends to get him in the door so that means if a customer on average when they opt in spends 30 dollars with them over three months that's how much he spends so he loses 30 up front so what you need to understand is that when you're doing this the number one way to make sure your ads actually scale further is you need to find a way to make it so that if you are getting a lead in and you used to be able to only pay ten dollars per lead you need to make it so you can pay thirty dollars per lead that's how you scale you don't focus on the targeting and i know this chicken scratch looks nice but don't focus on the targeting you can only do so well with the targeting and once you understand that concept i showed you before your targeting is going to be pretty simple and good to go what you want to do is you need to make sure that you can afford to pay more per lead and that's by getting people to spend more over a month two months five months 10 months and the only way you can do that is you actively have to track it which just allows me to segment into the next thing you need to know just straight up if i go look at some of our high-risk tracking results right here and i look at last click you're going to consistently see when you just use ad manager tracking you're not going to get the accurate data that's coming in you need to be using print tracking there's just not enough points of there's not enough touch points for them to actively track anything to the point you need to once you're at scale you can see right here for example we only had seven calls well reported 11 calls and there was actually no sales from this and you can see right here i reported one call when there was actually two calls and there's actually a mass amount of profit from this and so i'm going to scale around these things you can even see right here reports six calls when there's three report eight calls when there is five and i can go into my back end and hirose and i can look at the sources for every single one of my calls none of my calls are not getting attributed okay and this is chronic when you have multiple traffic sources chronic when you have organic traffic this is chronic when you're doing social media every single one of my calls right here is being attributed there's not some bogus calls that are being tracked by facebook and then not being tracked by us we literally have the exact county call sheet plugged into here and so you need to know the true source of where your calls are coming from you know the true source where your leads are coming from and you you need to know and you need to know the true source of where your sales are coming from this applies to e-commerce webinars and whatnot and again i'm just showing you very quickly over my shoulder and my job is not to push harus on you in this video but when you're operating off of incorrect data you're operating off of incorrect data and that's not too bad when you're at a hundred bucks a day scale when you're at five thousand ten thousand bucks a day scale that thirty percent five 25 40 you're off by that starts to really kill your ads because your ad budgets and profits gets much tighter at scale and the way you scale is by having those 30 to 50 margins especially at scale for example if i'm spending 10k a day and i have 30 waste on my account and that results in me only making 10k a day back i can't scale if i fix this 30 50 of waste and i'm making 13k a day back off of 10k suddenly i can scale so i can scale quite easily and as you go and start buying and scaling up your ads that waste right there is going to come and bite you because your profit margin goes down as you scale always and so you need to keep that profit margin as high as you possibly can for for as long as you possibly can and then again the other thing i was talking about you need to know the ltv you need to know the back end for your customers so for example this one funnel right here cost me about 150 200 bucks to get a phone call and that's been gradually going up for a long time now but i know if i track everything my customers buy over a period of time back to the original ads that i'm making 749 for every single person that books a call with us so i'm just fine paying 200 per phone call almost 3.5 xing my money cash every single time just for this one simple funnel that's how you scale your ads because if i was looking at the upfront value by week one or week two my ltv is 187 bucks and that's really what the ad managers are going to be able to catch they're not going to track this far out they're just not there's too many phone switches there's too many device switches there's too many ip switches there's too many cookie clearings it's not going to happen and so my business would be dead in the water if i was going up these numbers so track your stuff okay trying to scale with 30 50 waist in the account and then not knowing your ltv it's just making it so you're playing a massive disadvantage because every other big business is doing this when they're scaling and this example right here i'm just using hiros i don't know how else you could do this but whatever way you decide to do it even if you don't want to use hiros like figure out some way to do it because it's incredibly important for scaling finally you have to understand this thing as well when you first launch an offer you're going to have this marketplace and there's going to be a segment of the marketplace it's just hungry it's not huge but maybe 25 the marketplace just really wants to buy what you're selling because of this when you first start up ads it's going to be artificially high your roi is going to be higher than it will normally be over time and what's going to happen as you go deeper and deeper into this marketplace is you're going to start burning through people who have different layers of interest and eventually you're getting into this big void right here of people that really need to be sold to and convinced and so what's gonna happen is when you first kick up your ads even if you get to a thousand two thousand dollars a day sale scale you're going to see okay cool i spend a thousand dollars a day i make 5k back and then after three months you're going to say whoa oh i spend a thousand dollars a day and i only make 3k back then i spend 1k a day and i only make 1.5 k back what's happening is the offer dead no what's happening is you sold out to all the people that are super interested and you're going to have to consistently improve your copy you're going to have to increase consistently improve the opt-in rates in every little aspect of your funnel and that's just normal and so what you need to be thinking about when you have your ads is expect the roi to always be falling and we need to be constantly looking at how can i improve the offer to convert higher how can i improve the copy to be more convincing what am i not understanding about the customers how can i increase the opt-in rate of our webinar of our sales call funnel of our e-commerce business how can i go and improve and improve this by another five percent because you need to understand that when you're at 5k day what most people do is they sit back on their loins and just chill out for example when i was scaling an offer to a million dollars per month i got it to 300 000 a month very quickly and then it started breaking even then i went and improved it more and got it to a million a month in sales then it did the same exact thing then it went backwards again and either going to improve the offer again and if i had just been this entire time just knowing that it was going to collapse i could have really countered this off and stopped my ads from going into a place where the roi got unacceptable and so that's the last tip i wanted to give you right there and that is why people's facebook and youtube ads die that is why they died they're selling to the wrong market segment like i showed you before they're trying to sell a b2b offer to a mass market or they're trying to sell a mass market to a b2b audience they're pricing the product wrong for the audiences they're trying to sell a cheap product to a small audience never works they're trying to sell a super expensive product to a mass audience they're not positioning right that's the number one reason why people's ads fall apart next people aren't tracking their ltv or more importantly they just aren't tracking even their upfront numbers okay i've seen so many people webinars i've seen my webinar where if i go and track them in hiros then we're only catching 30 40 of sales that results in so much waste in the account and then finally people are again always looking at their targeting instead of looking at long-term optimization of the funnel which is something that's just always going to need to happen and hopefully it's way more optimized than my chicken scratch test so this is exactly what you should be looking at now guys like always in this video i was showing you inside my hi-ris account if you actually just want to track your ads get a demo want us to analyze your account and show you where all your waste is at schedule a call with us below we'll go through we'll look at what you're doing with your ads we'll look at how your tracking can be improved we'll look at how much money you can save and we'll just show you how much money you can save if there is potential for it to be saved if there isn't potential for you to scale more with tracking there isn't potential for you to save a ton of money we'll just tell you that okay because at highrose when people come to high roast there's a 90 day refund guarantee so if people don't see dramatic tracking results and all the things i talked about in this video they don't pay so we're just straight up with you there on top of that if you're interested in getting more info on that funnel and ad consulting mastermind i talked about there's a link below as well you can go on there i'll hop on a call with you we'll talk about how you can improve your ads what you're doing and again we'll just be straight and say oh this could be a huge gain for you in the business and if you're interested in joining you can or we'll just show you some really cool things on the call that's it finally what i really encourage you to do if you're watching this video because you're interested in ads join the hi-ros facebook group just just go to facebook type in hirose should be one of the first things that shows up the high official hirose forum there is a qualification process you need to be spending some significant ad spend in there however we have over 50 million a month in ads spent in there if you put all of our members together and so it's pretty much the best ad form you could possibly be on online right now so i would go check that out that being said subscribe this channel because i release new videos which is crazy in-depth training like this every single week and if you want to see those well you should be subscribed so you get notified that's it check out the other videos at the end of this video as well i'll link some of my best ones as well for you and i'll see you next time i post on this channel this has been alex becker thanks for checking us out and i'll see you next time [Music]

TITLE: This HTML Swap DOUBLES Facebook Ad Profits
VIDEO ID: M1c7znLE1sE
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1c7znLE1sE
================================================================================

in this video i'm going to show you three simple things that will reduce your ad cost on facebook even youtube ads actually any ads where you're running something and you need people to convert higher these three little micro adjustments will make your opt-ins your conversion rate your sales rate much higher without you actually changing anything on your funnel because what i've seen constantly from working with clients at hi-ros and looking at all the information coming in there and just my own funnels is that there's usually these small hang-ups that people just don't know about in their funnels like for example the type of html that's page or how you're loading up your scripts or just simply how you're linking to your pages from facebook they can go and easily increase your conversion rate by another five ten in fact i'm going to show you a little switch in this that i made that makes almost virtually no difference to the funnel functionally took me absolutely no effort and improved my opt-in rate by almost 30 that increases my profit my roi my revenue by 30 as well so it's definitely worth it and that's what we're gonna get into in today's highways training it's that damn simple if you're wondering why i'm teaching all these things it's simple when your ad accounts grow you're probably going to need to track them and if i help you grow your ad accounts you're probably going to think maybe i should track them with hiros it's going to help you save so much money on your ads and help you scale much further once you get to some type of scale so i'm going to help you scale as much as i possibly can so that being said we're going to hop into my computer right now and i want to show you these three things this just saved me a whopping butt ton of money and maybe a lot more revenue so let's skip to intros and fancy talk just get these and surprise surprise i'm gonna do way more than three i was doing this list and there's so many little things that have improved my roi immensely without effort so i'm just gonna share them all with you and then i'll stop when i get bored so first one right here this one is huge this is a case study i shared inside my uh consulting mastermind we basically go over our funnels and our ads and basically everything i'm doing and everything i've done the scalia figure businesses more importantly i share all my tests and everything i'm doing there and this test was huge so i knew this was going to happen because i did this with one of my first info businesses a lot of people host all their opt-ins on landing page softwares you might be using click funnels or other landing page softwares now convert tree out here is actually pretty good but most landing page softwares they're very slow and you wouldn't notice this because when you check your landing pages you're probably checking from your computer or your phone and you're using a place has a good connection but you have to understand most people browsing around facebook and watching youtube ads they're you a lot of the time not at their home they're not in a stable internet connection so they're going to be working with pretty small or slow download speeds and so these can take ages to download seven seconds 10 seconds this page for example right here when we converted it from click funnels to pure html the opt-in rate jumped from 18 uh to 32 you can see that in this test right here this one the first test that came in and after about 250 visitors the final results were what was on click funnels was 18 and what was on html was i believe 31 percent that's massive that's 30 percent more customers opting in that means if i have a funnel that's sharing 100k a month from that 18 opt-in rate i go and increase that that thing is going to generate an extra thirty thousand forty thousand a month just for making that change that's all i did that's all i did drastically improved opt-in rates now do i suggest you take all your funnels off of click funnels or landing page software no what i see when people go to the next page is they're a little bit more lenient with the load time so there's a lot of advantages to be on a landing page software so just letting you know that but you want your first landing pages to be in total hyper fast html you can upload this directly to your site no wordpress no anything and that's going to give you the maximum oomph and this is the most important page of your funnel because how people interact with it determines the whole entire rest of the interaction okay so if you can get past my ugly face right here i'm about to share two other huge things this this applies to youtube supplies of facebook first off biggest one at the end of your videos let the person know when it's done i can't stress this enough when you're doing this on youtube especially what happens is a lot of people end their ad and it just ends so the person a lot of people are going to watch the ad and it just boom ends on them and then they're watching their video and then they're watching cats and you've lost them so what you want to do is at the end of your videos just have a simple message saying hey it's time to click the ad click to get the script and the free training on how to use it that's it that's it's the most immensely important thing you can do and you should also do this on facebook as well if you don't do this people watch the ad then it stops then they don't know what to do next they do know what to do next but they have to be prodded okay next thing i'd really suggest is that the top of your ads in in facebook and youtube ads have a extremely curiosity peaking headline you don't want to tell them what the person is going to see in the video what you want to do is you want to create curiosity to get them to click the video and turn on sound on facebook or to get them to watch that five seconds on youtube this right here and what you say right here is incredibly important on youtube because those first five seconds you don't want to tell them what they're going to see because then they know what they're going to see and they're going to click away you want to say something that's extremely interesting to your target market for example if i said something like you know watch this cat eat a pizza in 10 seconds it's going to get the entire internet watching it that's not good that's going to drive up my view rate on my ads and drive up the cost i want to have something that says something like the biggest edge in digital ads right now and it only means something to for example you if you're watching this video you're interested in ads i'm going to track you on that video and repulse everybody else that's how you keep the ad costs a lot lower especially on youtube again just because a video has really high interaction and views doesn't mean it's getting the right people in fact on youtube we'll make your costs a lot higher if you're attracting everybody because then they're going to show up to everybody and we don't want everyone who wants to watch a cat eat a pizza want everybody who wants to create digital ads or whatever your target market is okay so the next one guys this is again so simple because you just have to do it you don't have to add anything to it track your ads you can see right here the funny thing that's going on is you can see that if i'm going off of what google is telling me this example right here one i'm using call funnel so google's not going to track my sales i constantly see people optimizing their ads for opt-ins and calls specifically if you're doing this it's going to get you calls but that doesn't mean all calls are created equal it also doesn't mean all opt-ins are created equal the only thing you want to be optimizing in your funnels for is sales okay and so this is using the high-risk extension right here i don't know how else you can do this i'm not trying to push hiros onto you right now but the only way i could actually track my sales and optimize around actual numbers is by doing this and more importantly just be hyper aware of this the facebook pixel is not going to go and consistently deliver accurate results you can see right here if i go and look at let's say these audiences right here and i go look at these results of the calls coming in i guarantee this audience right here that says eight calls right here you can see it only generate three calls now i'm perfectly happy with this 400 per column my niche is absolutely excellent for me but a lot of times what you're going to see with view through conversions and how facebook loads up its pixels it's going to report more calls than it's actually bringing in and on top of that it's not going to be again reporting off of actual sales coming in as well and so my biggest advice for you too is don't take what's being reported to you at face value in there first off always optimize around money because if you do that you're going to get the best roi most people don't and so they have these call funnels or webinar funnels or even e-commerce funnels where they're going off all these metrics are relevant to the cash that's coming in and if you incentivize google and facebook to deliver calls and opt-ins it's going to deliver those as much as it possibly can ignore the roi because it's not being targeted towards roi and then finally the next thing is understand that view through conversions and double firing of pixels and everything that goes on that's a thing it's a it's a big real thing i can go in and verify every single one of these calls and where they came from i can go inside of hiros and i can see every single call that came in and attribute where it came from you can see i have not missed attribution on a call out of 20 calls that came in there's only one that didn't get attributed okay 2 out of 30 at this point right here i see where every single one came from there's no calls coming in my system that aren't attributed and so what a lot of people are doing is they're working off this number right here and that's just causing all sorts of chaos in their business they don't even know okay this cost per call is fine for me but i see people paying a thousand dollars per call when they think they're getting a hundred dollars per call don't do that it takes seconds to set that up and actually track your ads which i suggest using hiris or you can use whatever solution you want just just do it okay so the next one i want to show you i see this all the time on facebook you see this fold right here the seymour you need to understand that most people coming from facebook most people in general these days are on their phone so this is all people are going to see on their phone and what a lot of people do is they go and write their ads thinking that people are going to click see more i don't know about you i don't click see more on a lot of ads so while people will go and click see more and while you will see slightly better conversions when people read your entire script and it's well written it's great copy what i've found is extremely important is you need to make your message wrap up or at least be very clear before this see more link right here when you're writing out your message you can see i have about this line right here to make a point ai tracking drops add cpa by 30 to 50 it allows optimization other businesses cannot replicate and it takes two seconds to set up you want to create curiosity and you want to create the big benefit they're going to get if they click see more more importantly click see this ad next thing you want to do that i think is also super important is you want to create almost tmz like headlines you want to create something that tells a story you never want to tell people exactly what they're going to get come here and get this blueprint nobody wants a blueprint they want to hear the end of a story these two things right here on facebook ads work like gangbusters and you should really check out my last video on how to design thumbnails because i have a little bit more insight when it comes to designing thumbnails because i have 500 000 subscribers on my youtube channel i know the algorithm works because i know how people click images and if you understand how to do that with your facebook images your youtube ad images you're going to do so much better when it comes to ctr and so i'm not going to talk about images right now but those are two things right there i see people just mess up all the time they tell people exactly what they're going to get there's no story to be completed and they they write the whole entire thing like this they just keep writing and they like write their entire message and then the message gets cut off by seymour and people on their mobile phones are not seeing the message they're not getting curiosity and their cpl goes up and it's just bonkers and they're sending people to landing pages created on landing page platforms that are slow they're driving their opt-ins through the roof next thing i want to show you on here and this only really applies to webinars and opt-in type funnels it's so easy if you simply go on your funnels and offer an extra bonus on this one i offer a copy and paste tracking script to accomplish this right here but one thing that really increased our opt-in rates at hcom which was my info business i took the eight figures last year is what i also offered was a cheat list of the best products if you go in there and you make your big headline and then you offer just a small bonus you don't want to have a bonus that completely replaces the need to opt in but if you offer something on top of it so for example in our age commands i said we're going to show you exactly how we built the shopify store and got to this level and also if you come and check this out we're going to give you a list of the most high converting products online right now that you can be selling doing that right there just dramatically increased our opt-ins we didn't change anything just instantly the opt-in rates increased by 10 so we went from 30 to closer to 40 percent and that doesn't seem huge 10 seems small but that's actually a 25 ish it's a very large increase it's a 30 increase almost on the amount of people coming to the funnel that's huge that's huge it's almost one-third more customers coming in that increases the entire business just doing something simple like that can just change everything another little tip that i'm going to show you that really helped our opt-ins whenever you put in an image right here don't put an image of yourself looking professional in a suit that's what everybody does looking like everybody else never works for anybody at least when you want to get to higher levels that's just some general advice right there but what i find works really quickly is you create an image that looks like a video is about to be played that creates curiosity people love charts and graphs this is not a large lee applicable piece of advice but if you can go and get charts and graphs in your content people always want to know what's going on in charts and graphs i can watch wistia videos and the attention goes up whenever a graph comes up or a chart you ad runners love graphs and charts anyways having this right here with the play button right here people click that like crazy and then once a person has clicked it and became began the action chain they're usually going to go and type in their email all right so it's really just about getting this click on this page and so this is a really kind of kind of coy way tongue-in-cheek way to get the click and it works it works final thing i'm going to give you try ugly pages or at least split test them this page right here is terrible so ugly but when i go look at most people's opt-ins it looks like we're going and signing up to go to an elon musk tesla convention okay it's it's ridiculous and i'm not saying ridiculous to be rude or saying that it's stupid i'm saying it's ridiculous because i know it doesn't convert as well because i've tested almost every single type of opt-in and landing page there is these ugly white background blank text pages just convert higher i would use a different page if something else convert higher because frankly i don't like these pages i want my pages to look nice and hot and sexy but this always converts higher because really the most important thing when it comes to ads is readability and that the person understands what they're looking at that's really it that's truly really it and so what i suggest you do with your opt-in pages or your ads is try using really simple pages if you look at amazon it looks terrible but there's no way it's not the most optimized form of a page okay no one really comes and looks at a page that says oh man this doesn't look good or not when they're making those knee-jerk decisions maybe when it comes to like researching something you go to apple's website they have beautiful pages go to you know any other cool website of their beautiful pages purple.com is an example however when people are making knee-jerk decisions you need to just give them the information so they can make the knee-jerk decision as fast as possible because knee-jerk decisions aren't done through thought they're done like that you're walking through the the line at let's say target you see a candy bar you pick it up you go okay this always converts significantly that being said guys that's the train for today those are a couple things that have just dramatically improved my roi it take almost no effort to do real quickly if you want to see how to track your ads like i talked about before how to make sure that you're working with the right data just go schedule a hi-ros call with us below we will actually analyze your ad account and make sure that one you actually have the ability to do this and it's a good fit for you and that you will actually see an roi if you start tracking like this and we'll even show you

i've showed you right here because at high risk we have a 90 day refund guarantee that means if you don't see these results and you don't make more money we don't make any more money on top that i

TITLE: These 4 Ad Designs CRUSH Facebook Ads

================================================================================

hirolians it is becker and i have another ad training for you surprise surprise not really a surprise i've released these like once a week and send them to here it is i'm going to show you my facebook ads that are generating millions of dollars in sales at a significant roi for example on some of our high res funnels we're able to go out there and spend let's say three thousand dollars a day and routinely do fifteen twenty and sometimes even close to thirty thousand dollars a day in sales i wanna show you these funnels and i wanna show you how i started them up and how i also run them for my other business iron which is just a coaching program that helps people run their ads but i'm not pitching the coaching program here i just want to show you how i run the ads there as well so you can kind of compare it to your business because if you're looking at high roast or using house you're probably selling info marketing or e-commerce this will help you you might again be wondering alex why are you telling me this what's the catch there is no catch i want you to make more money from your ads so that you'll then think to yourself i want to make even more money for my ads so i'm going to track them using hiros which is the best in the world at that then when you combine this information with iris you're going to make even more money and upgrade your hires account so it's in my best interest to just tell you everything i know about running ads so let's get into my facebook ads and i'll show you how these work all right guys so since we're on the topic of facebook ads i'm just going to dive straight into my facebook ad manager so let's talk about how we scale facebook ads and what strategies have been the most successful for me particularly for a call funnel or something where i'm selling high ticket though this applies to virtually anything i want to start something off very clearly at the very beginning of this and that's this i don't like to hit you guys over the head with pitches for hiros and these trainings i'm just going to show you one of the most important things to me scaling is that i can clearly see my actual ad results right here using the chrome extension from hirose again i'm not trying to do a pitch right here it's just i don't see how i can run ads without this because you can see i have seven calls from this one ad right here facebook missed all of them and you can see that it gave itself 12 calls right here when it only had seven it gave itself two when it had uh only one right here and so again it's not even going to track the sales on webinars or sales call funnels whatsoever which you can see i'm able to track very easily right here that's just because of how facebook works and i'm not saying their tracking is super bad but when you have google ads running when you have facebook ads running when you have multiple layers of campaigns running at the same exact time when you have multiple facebook ad accounts you're going to get so much crisscrossing reporting especially when you factor in the fact that facebook will go and generate a lot of its reporting based on duplicate people viewing a page or a person reloading a page a few times and that just becomes insanely important because of this you can see i actually just got this chrome extension up about a week ago but if i go look at my ads from last month you can see i turn off many ads that were actually generating me a profit okay look at this one right here mass amount of profit coming in mass amount of profit coming in mass amount of profit coming in mass amount of profit coming in and two of these profitable ads right here this one was actually turned off so i'm going to be turning that one back on so first and more foremost rule number one use the actual data that you have i don't know how you can track it without iris but i mean maybe you can figure out some other system and then rule number two scale based on profit scale based on profit if you're scaling based on cost per call you can see this one right here had a really bad cost per call very profitable very very very profitable so if you're scaling based around your opt-in rates your call rates or some other data one don't scale around that scale bound profitability two if you are scaling around cost per call verify the calls coming in especially if you have multiple other traffic sources especially if you have multiple other traffic sources because facebook loves to give itself credit for virtually everything else you're doing on those other traffic sources when that's just not the case a lot of the time if you're scaling off something else you're scaling off faulted data it's just that simple so let me kind of show you how my strategy works and i'm going to show you this by showing you my best ads and really the psychology behind them if you nail this you're going to do very well with facebook ads i guarantee this will almost improve your roi on your ads immediately why can i say that because the insights i'm going to give you are insights that very few people i network with a lot of top youtubers people that have five million and tens of millions of subscribers it's one of the benefits that comes with my channel and the insights i'm going to give you are insights that most people don't have because most people that run ads don't run a youtube channel and if you look at youtube thumbnails and you look at youtube headlines you have the absolute key to creating great facebook ads also if you look at the native content that's on facebook and you mix it in with what's going on on youtube you're going to understand what people look at what they click and how they behave so there's three types of ads that do exceptionally well on facebook and instagram these are going to be the infographic style ads that you always see running around these are ads where you have infographics running okay that's what people watch when they're on facebook and and instagram image ads constructed in a very specific way and cell phone ads where you're talking in front of a cell phone let me explain these one by one so the first thing i want to explain is actually how i form my text and my headlines you can see this is very important on facebook because most people don't do this check out this line of text right here you can see how it ends at the c-more line right here this is where it ends on the mobile phone which is where most of your ads are going to be seen at so it's very important that you make your big benefit before that in terms of ad ry this line of javascript has been my unfair advantage for years i pay 30 to 50 less for my customers than my competitors okay you can see dan mai so the big enticing benefit is before the seymour next the headline you again want to make sure that it's not cut off you want to make sure the headline's not cut off this is basic stuff and here's where it gets more a lot more advanced when you're forming your text and when you're forming your headline there are a few things you want to keep in mind one you never tell the person what they're going to gain when they click the ad what do i mean by that the biggest mistake i see on youtube and facebook is people say let's use this as an example hey i'm going to teach you to make more money from your shopify store how to make money on shopify what happens when people see that every single shopify ad they've ever seen and every single experience they've had with a make money online is now put onto your ad this is bad if a person can guess what they're going to see they're not they're not enticed for example if you've already seen i ask you if you want to see do you want to go see return of the jedi you're going to say no i've already seen that i know what that's about there's no mystery the feedback loop has been completed so what you do instead with your text and your ads is you never tell them what they're going to see you tell them the big benefit and you create mystery around it in terms of ad ry for example at high risk i'm selling ad tracking in terms of ad right this line of javascript has been my unfair advantage for years i paid 30 to 50 less for my customers mystery i didn't say anything about tracking aa print tracking is like jet fuel for social ads what the hell is ai print tracking okay well first off at hiros we do use ai to scale ads and we do use print tracking it's called fingerprint tracking it's a very unknown type of tracking that most people aren't aware of that's why our tracking is so much more accurate because we're able to fingerprint people's devices and whatnot however most people don't know that so the the theory that i laid out in front of you before i talked about this still rings true so you can see i've never i haven't told the person what they're going to get but i've created a lot of mystery that hooks a person that's interested in paying less for their customers and wants to be on the cutting edge of ad optimization which is the benefit that we actually sell at high risk the ability to make more money from your ads so what you want to do is if let's say you're selling a shopify course how to make more money or how to teach a beginner how to make money on shopify for example or anything that you're selling i'm just using as an example i would not say hey click here and we'll show you to make money on shopify person is going to say i've seen that movie before i know i know exactly what i'm going to see right here the feedback loops already been completed i'm going to say something like the import strategy 711 used to make a 5 000 markup that i'm now using to make an extra 500 a day what is that going to attract it's going to attract a person that wants to make more money and is enticed by this new opportunity that's how you get a person to click an ad and then come on to the next page that's how you get people who are your target market through while not saying exactly what you're doing you never want to put something in front of someone that explains exactly what they're going to get you want to put massive benefit and mystery so there's fear of missing out so next what you want to do is on all of your ads it's extremely important that the first thumbnail has only one focal point why well if you go look at my youtube well if you go look at my youtube channel if you look at videos where there's a lot going on look at this one how to spot a bad biz group there's like tons of faces going on here the sleep pack that saved my life there's like this confusing thing right here the diet increased my iq by 10 points only 45 000 views then you look at this one right here it's just my face and brain looking turd thing nothing explained whatsoever if you want to understand click-through rates look at this while never play video games again after learning if you were making an ad right now like most people on facebook they make a video that says why video games are bad for you in the thumbnail and put them like playing a video game or something like that and they put something like video games lower your attention span no one will click that however you can see videos like this one graham steven ruined everything the entire background is phased out the lamborghini is highlighted graham is highlighted there's only one thing for the eye to folk focal on right here i don't know if that's the right way to describe but there's only one place for the eye to rest person scrolling through boom i rest right here and you want their eye to rest on something that creates intrigue they want to go what what the heck just happened here then there's a headline that incites them now on youtube this is a little bit more difficult to do because you're inciting people by guessing what's going to catch their attention with ads you know what's going to catch the person's attention you're hunting for a very specific type of person okay check out this ad right here this is an example of a usual facebook ad one million a month youtube ad scripts my eight figure youtube ad script 21 000 views no one watches it i put a video like this one never buy this just me sitting in a corner i spent millions on garbage 189k views you never want to tell them what they're going to get you want to focus their eye on something and drag them in now with video ads it's super important that you then once their eye gets locked in you have a headline of the main benefit they're going to get and then you have the text right here this is what most people are going to watch most people are not going to listen most people are not going to listen unless you really give them a reason to listen and that's pretty hard to do consistently so you need to imagine the person's watching this and they're viewing this silently and so you can see a person can really get what's going on in the ad and the text underneath it from the text that's going on in the video ad that's why infographic ads work so well in my opinion because what people love to see if you've ever been scrolling through facebook a lot of times you don't turn on the the sound on the videos you watch but you will go and watch those damn infographic ads that have text underneath them and have like cool graphics that change every three to five seconds that's how you make your case and you copyright to somebody because people aren't going to read this c more very often either okay they're going to watch this right here especially if you have a video okay so you want to use these infographic style ads because this is what people get hooked to constantly changing if it's you just walk around sitting in front of a desk it looks like an ad it's boring they've seen that movie before next the next type of ad it works very well for me now that we understand the principles between the headline and the text same exact principles for the text and headlines so i'm not going to cover it again same youtubey kind of image right here if i did this again i would actually blur out the background just put me right here and just even empty your room why what the heck is going on here i'm staying in a room that's completely empty and a tank top looking like i'm going to teach a dance class you can see that interaction right here people just freaking out this image hooks them it hooks them what's going on here then the person comes through here and because i'm targeting my target market with the targeting they're going to read the text in the headline and be intrigued and then click when you're doing your image ads you want to have only one focal point in the ads if you have a bunch of things going on or it's like you sitting on the beach it's so stupid that's that you the the point with an image ad is to hook the eye to hook the eye and create a question hook the eye and create a question hook the eye and create a question or you use a bold statement in the ad to create a question you can see what worked really well right here do this through three hours or die poor and in my face with extreme emotion the next type of image ad that works very well is a big bold mysterious statement and extreme emotional expressions and you'll see this a ton in my retargeting ads it's absolutely key to my retargets here's me about to cry giving this up killed me but i had to killed it 129k views no yes you see this big you see a very simple image right here there's nothing else going on here no yes people what you you can't go and just put like yourself standing the beach it has to be something that creates a question when they look at the ad so those are the two ways you can do it with image ads you'll see a lot of my retargeting the final type of ad that i find it works really well is what are people watching when they're on instagram and facebook they're watching they're watching phone ads and by phone ads what i mean is they're watching phone videos when you're scrolling to instagram you're gonna look at three different things you're going to look at those damn infographic videos you're going to look at pictures of people and the pictures that do the best the single focal ones that have a question with them make people go what's going on here and then third third you're going to be watching people talking on their phones that's the type of content that's on the internet that's the ticktacky-like content that's all over the internet so what you want to do is you want to have this right here because people don't go and see the sponsored thing going on right here but they see a phone ad and that's going to get you the chance to at least have their attention and you won't have the text underneath it same exact thing you want to hook them with the phone app i was going to do this ad again i'd actually put a headline right here as well or if you can look at other phone videos out there you won't want to look like an ad headline you want to put something almost look like a news headline or whatnot underneath here and that works very well as well these three types of ads kill it you want to use these for cold ads when you're doing retargeting ads here's what i found also killed you want to create that type of thumbnail that i discussed on youtube extreme emotion and a bold statement that creates a question person scrolling through right here they see this pissed off expression this provocative statement and then i really make the case in the text and you can see right here the goal of retargeting ads is not to sell somebody again it's to get someone to come back and if you want somebody to come back you want to do the same exact thing that you would do on youtube you hook them you hook them you get their attention and then you basically make a big benefit call to action you use the image to hook them and you make it very clear what they're going to get right here okay because the mystery mystery's over they already know what your ads are about they've already been sold to before so you just want to go for the big benefit and the best way to get them to pay attention the big benefit is with a very strong emotional face because that's what people respond to and a provocative statement using p tracking plus ai to optimize ads gets customers cheaper and lets you scale easier so again i'm using a bit of mystery right here thermo fear of missing out and again how we hyper scale ads with data plus ai i never say i never ever say better way to track your facebook ads or how to do your sales attribution better people don't want to see that they want to see this mysterious thing they don't quite understand what it is but they know what's going to get them a result it's provocative like that like that funny vocal track if you've heard that before from will ferrell that's what you want to do that absolutely works another thing that works really well is using memes or pictures for movies that hooks people's attention because they always they're used to stopping for that content so use a powerful emotional expression provocative statement make a very clear benefit-driven statement in your headline and your text what i find also works is saying we'll back it up and then again keeping it mysterious when i see people do so with e-commerce ads and other type of ads it's so dumb to me when they go and they just tell the person like hey come here and we'll show you how to get get this hat or take this acne supplement and it will clear up your acne no you want to use something that like creates that mystery like this weird weird micro toxin actually reverses wrinkles in people over the age of 63 years old watch us back it up here and then you link them to the ecommerce product that does that same exact concept for info proc same exact concept for sales call funnels it goes on and on and on so this right here if you apply this i think you're gonna do so much better on facebook because if you actually scroll through and look at most facebook you can tell their ads right away like this is an ad but like if you see someone doing this i love russell if you see someone doing this you know it's an ad like moving around and like this this looks this screams that russell's gonna sell me something okay this one right here would be this would work great you can see anik for example if he was doing this and he actually ran this as an actual ad this would do great because it looks like tik tok content love my friend austin right here and i'm not seeing a huge amount of ads on facebook right here but again you don't want to have things that look like ads you want to have that youtubey like call to action right there you don't want to have something that looks like it's it was planned or something like that you want to have that tick tocky infographic type of ads that create interest and hook the eye to a focal point this looks like an ad 101 right here this is this is exactly the type of content people use on ads this screams i'm going to sell you something it screams you know the end of this story right here okay so i'm not hating on anybody's content or anything right here but it's just it's so obvious when you see people with these type of openings on their ads or with this type of content right here and then you see tiktaki style ads or infographic ads or just pure focal point youtube ads crushing it so that's a train for the day guys and again massive reminder especially if you're doing long term sales funnels where there's multiple different types of traffic sources you need to go out there when you're running your facebook ads as well optimize off of actual roi not opt-ins or cost per caller clicks or add the cards optimize around roi and then actually track things correctly with all your traffic sources combined in facebook the ad dashboard is not putting all your traffic sources in one place i also have google ads running i have people that come directly to our website and facebook is also going to give itself all sorts of view throughs and double count things and you can't verify it so that's the rule number two now that being said if you want to have the same exact tracking that you've seen in this video again there's you can just go schedule a call below you can check out hires we have a 90 day refund guarantee on anybody that joins hiros because if you don't see results we don't want your money and you can schedule that call to learn more about high-risk and tracking right here on top of that if you want to actually get help with ad training and tactics you want to see i've scaled multiple businesses to seven figures and eight figures using ads the funnels the strategies to add tactics targeting everything you can actually just book a call with me here and there's more details about that right underneath the video and if you want some more high-risk training you can't wait till next week we have some of our best posts right underneath this video right here on our blog and there'll also be some videos suggested after this video on youtube so until next time guys this has been alex becker thanks so much for being a part of the high risk community i'll see in the next [Music] video you

TITLE: I Spend $25k On The Keyword Money
VIDEO ID: qXA2psT6bWw

================================================================================

[Music] okay guys you read that title right and I'm not just gonna drop $25,000 on the keyword money on my ads no no no no no no that's that's baby stuff I just wanted to set the bar a little low for you simpletons but now that I've got you where I want you we're gonna be spending about $500,000 on the keyword money in this video look jokes aside last year we were able to break eight figures and sales mostly from running YouTube ads and one of the craziest audiences that got the best results which is bidding on crazy simple little keywords like the keyword money but that's it just that's it that's the entire ad audience I'm not kidding just the keyword money I'm also gonna show you other audiences which delivered huge results that kind of break this rule that use like two key words make money it doesn't get any simpler than this and I'll even show you the ads that I ran they're comically easy you see people saying I'll show you to make money on your iPhone no screw that all you need is a PowerPoint presentation for this I'm not joking and let's back up okay this does take some ad experience I have a lot of experience running ads but if you're beginner this is gonna kind of show you what running ads at a high scale looks like and if you're a veteran this is gonna help you stop the super over complication that's in the industry right now I go into all these ad groups or these Facebook groups and their strategy is being shared or ridiculous it's like all right first thing you got to do is do a handstand and make sure it's raining outside and you got to do six prayers to Mark Zuckerberg and then you're gonna layer 15 audiences and make sure that it only displays on this net what the what the are you doing just just do this let me show you so here's what to do first things first go and smash that like button look if you appreciate these type of videos it would super help me out if you hit the like button because it helps with algorithm and that's how I'm gonna say just take a second click it all right let's get back to it okay guys so we're inside my AdWords account right now and I want to show you this because it's hilarious and I want to show you to do it because if you understand how it works it's just way easier to run ads so you can see I've set it to January 2019 to today right here I'm gonna go back through our ad campaigns now you can see right here we spent about three million bucks on this one account right here and the conversion value reported back is about six million dollars usually if you've seen any of my wonderful tracking ads that I'm running right now for high rose you're gonna know that AdWords usual only catches about forty to fifty percent of sales for this type of funnel so it's a little bit higher than that I'm actually significantly higher than that but we can just work with this a3x ROI ish to X ROI that that's still just Danny so low scale high-skill whatever you want to accept we can go from there now what I want to show you are these three audiences right here pure money make money and MMO intent these are the most simplest targeting's you could ever imagine and you can see right here about a hundred seventy-six thousand spent hundred twenty one thousand spent and sixty thousand spent right here this is the most beginner level anyone can do this targeting effort now I'm not suggesting in any way if you're complete beginner you're gonna replicate this or get these results this is not a way to make money in your basement I'm very good at running ads I'm very good at running ads I'm just showing you this for gee-whiz information for beginner I have no courses sell you so don't so don't come in here and think I'm gonna sell you some magic way to make money through YouTube ads you won't make money you won't be able to do this but you will learn and see what it looks like in a larger scale if you're a veteran maybe you should just take away that it can be much simpler than just probably doing right now so that being said if we go look at these audiences right here I want to show you first off just the audience okay so this audience that I'm running right here is a very very simple keyword audience you can see I just put in the keyword make money online okay and I think this one right here where's conversion value on this one see this one right here actually did really well as well it did 5,000 and cost at $10,000 back usually should increase it by about thirty percent right here so probably did about fifteen thousand dollars back and so the first thing I want to show you in this video is just how simple the targeting be I just targeted this keyword and did substantial amount of money from this and I target many other keywords just like this and this is one of the big components of how we did millions and millions of dollars worth of sales now I don't run these ads anymore cuz I really I don't want to be in the make money online niche I don't want to be tylo PEZ I want to build a software company and build type of businesses so I actually left this business and turned it over to my partners but just a really good example of how simple you're targeting and be regardless of what business you're getting into so this right here just targeting big huge broad keywords works exceptionally well with your ads and I want to show you the funniest thing about this one of the best performing ads so one of the ads it did best over time and it's going to show 0 over here because I destroyed the conversions to use offline conversions as I plug in the Jairo so that data got lost right there which is fine because I'm not running these ads anymore but one of the best performing ads right here was you've probably seen that this wolf mug ad and is literally just me filming me playing with a wolf mug just that it's just a video of me moving around a wolf mug talking about the wolf mug and how people can build Shopify businesses and whatnot and the one I wanted to really show you guys to just show you how simple it can be to advertise is this ad right here I'm only going to show you just the beginning of it but if we go look this I'm sure you might have seen this ad if you give me 39 seconds I'm gonna show you how this guy right here whoever generated where someone says if you give me this amount of seconds so you can see here this ad has about 5 million views on it and this is just literally a PowerPoint presentation of me cracking jokes about Arby's melts so this is why it blows my mind when I go in ad groups I see people doing these really professional videos and talking about these complicated targeting strategies the real key to running ads in my opinion is the message and knowing what the customer wants and then and then making a funnel on an ad that is so damn efficient that you can use it on big giant keywords for example another audiences that's super super well for us another ad group and just imagine those two ads those two ads generated millions of dollars in sales by themselves ok so you could go out there and legitimately if you want to go and maybe make a six-figure business or grow your business a little bit you really don't have to make any more ads or get more complicated than this now the next thing I want to show you that works really well is intent audiences because what you can do right here on AdWords is you can create these intent audiences does this allow you to go and target very basic keywords and in going target people that have been looking for these keywords recently this works really really well for me at high roast right now so you can see right here I just put an earn money online how to make money online and how to make money and the way I got those keywords is just by simply going over here to the keyword planner and one of the easiest ways you can go and create intent audiences just by going in here and I'm just gonna type in the keyword you know how to make money throw that in and you can see a list of keywords you can use to make intent audiences so one of the best ways I got results with our campaigns was just using really super basic intent audience you can see one of our also best performing keywords again was just me going and putting in Shopify and dropshipping as an intent audience you can see right here hundred thousand in probably about four hundred thousand dollars out when you account for AdWords missive attribution and the other thing I wanted to show you is if you look at our basic audiences right here all these are one word audiences so online jobs intent I just put an online jobs because obviously people that want to work an online job they probably want to go and start a business online or something like that so that right there you can see we put about 83,000 and probably did 150,000 to 200,000 back accounting for the attribution and so you're gonna notice that all my audiences that did best if we look at the cost of all the conversions this is a mountain it cost me to actually get a lead into my business they're all the most basic audiences that I'm targeting in Adwords and so if you're starting a business are you starting to advertise what I want to show you in this video is simply this the key to going in advertising online the key to going and building your business online or getting more customers isn't in complication it isn't and going and making some insane ad targeting that no one else can replicate and no one else knows about what I just showed you there anybody can do if you have access to a PowerPoint in a cell phone and the ability to type in whatever your business is the keyword is for example at high risk one of my main keywords is tracking because we sell tracking software see how that worked and that's because the secret to your ads is not your ads I'll repeat the secret to making a lot of money with ads is not ads if you go on any Facebook group you go on any marketing discussion it is people racking their brain and getting super complicated and when you look at people who are Facebook ad gurus or YouTube ad gurus what they do is they complicate and they complicate and they complicate it's ridiculous anybody can go out there and do what I just did a chimpanzee could go out there and do what I just did the thing that people can't replicate is going to be the message of the ads the funnel itself and the amount of time and effort goes into optimizing the funnel and the angle of the offer now h com only had these two strings what I just showed you now I'm no longer a part of that business cuz I really don't like to make money online niche I don't like selling I don't want to sell courses to beginners I just don't want to do that anymore I like working on my software company seriously only work with existing successful businesses now so if you're beginner don't buy any courses I will give you literally everything you need to know for free all the ads everything you need to know to get started it's all it's all my youtube channel there's links below to all sorts of trains they're all over my youtube should check them out don't buy a course just you don't need it that being said that funnel right there there's so many people if you go the YouTube right now and you type in shop fight hundreds of people trying to sell you a Shopify course everyone their dog wants you to start a Shopify store why was our funnel why were our ads able to be so successful and so many people struggle it's because of the hyper optimization and the funnel it's because of the hyper optimization of the marketing message because the hyper optimization of the copywriting and so what you need to take away from this video is if you want to start a business right now the angle part is actually the most important part at high roast right now our ads generate far more profit than those ads ever did far more profit ROI wise they're not scaled up to that level yet but the reason they are able to do that is because the offer is angled so much better it's such a more desired product and it's an offer that people can't really replicate it's gonna cost you a lot of money and almost a year and a half a development to make something like that and so that allows us to have a blue ocean all to ourselves and so you should pursue that first but then the second key is going to be the hyper optimization of your funnel and the copywriting and then of course the product after if you don't have a good product and people don't get results with your product they're not gonna buy your other products they're gonna refund it's gonna be a disaster so you need to make sure your Prok is top of the market as well and if you can do those things that's where your success with ads will come from so when you're scrolling around watching videos about training and advertising don't buy in to the complication the complication should not be in the ads it should be on the other side

TITLE: This Youtube Ad Script Is TOO Good
VIDEO ID: 9NwtdM-5K-k
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NwtdM-5K-k
================================================================================

hey what's up this is Alex Becker CEO of hi rose I'm just gonna cut straight with you right here I want to do business with you in the future and so I'm gonna do something kind of sneaky right here and just deliver massive value to look as a CEO of a big tracking company I have a pretty big advantage on knowing what's gonna work in ads I've also used that to scale multiple businesses that I own to seven and even past eight figures so I know a thing or two so I'm just gonna tell you what I know and I'm gonna give you some of my best tactics that I've used that I think are absolutely essential my ads the first thing I'm gonna give you right now is actually a YouTube ad script I've been forced to use for the past five years and the reason why I say forced to use is because I've tried every other type of script every type of filming scenario I've tried to do everything else under the Sun to get away from the script cuz it's so basic and so simple but nothing gets me customers as efficiently or cheaply as the script I'm forced to use it and if you can find something that beats it please let me know but this script right here this one ad is responsible for selling over 8200 high ticket courses I was able to sell over 18,000 subscriptions at my software company and I've used this consulting I've uses in services I've used this in everything this thing just absolutely crushes it and I think one of the best ways I can help you is just giving you this script and showing you how it works so you can use it on your YouTube ads and that's it now also if any point in this video you want to actually track your YouTube ads you should go below and hit the purple button we will go and show you exactly how to track this because AdWords tracking isn't isn't gonna be that accurate because of a lot of things that hold it back and you're gonna end up killing the ads that are making you money and investing in ads that are not making you money which is a double whammy and while you're watching this video if you think yourself I'm not Homer sent sure I need tracking right now but I'd love to see this funnel did you scale to eight figures I'd love to see how it works I realize I left you hang in there just click the green button below it's a complete train it shows you the exact ads the exact funnel even the copywriting targeting I use to scale one of my businesses to eight figures just using YouTube ads and the script that well I'm just gonna show you right now let's dive into it okay so we're first going to do is we're going to breakdown this script it's very simple and I'm actually going to show you myself executing this script and so there's a few things we need to understand the script has a few different parts and it all goes around one key aspect which is our promise now no matter what niche you're in there has to be a promise that hooks people there has to be something that gets people from point A to point B there has to be something they're seeking that is going to motivate them to click the ad opt in and do all the things that you're requesting to do which at the very end it requires me to take out a credit card or hop on a phone call even that's a lot there has to be something they really want in order to get them do that now your promise on your niche will be found in many different ways and usually you can find this with ads and the headlines of your opt-ins but at the basic level what people want is to avoid pain or avoid pain that they're already in or get excessive gain or get again without the things they hate so for example at high roast when I run add to that the entire promise is how to make significantly more and save significantly more from your business by pressing a button that's that's essentially what the promises without doing anything okay so if you go and see a lot of my ads that are running what we offer them is hey how you can go and save fifteen percent of your ad spend and scale twenty percent further just by activating this pixel AI training it's a very simple promise and that's a huge hook now I'm not going to get into how to design the opt-in this video but the thing I want to point out right there is you notice how I didn't mention sales attribution and say how you can use tracking to not waste money on ads and then make a bit more money from your ads because it also doesn't sound mysterious and so what you want to do is you want to think of what your promise is and then put it in a way to present it as a new opportunity this is absolutely essential to your ad so for example when I've run products for my old e-commerce training business what we do is we wouldn't say hey how to build a shop by store really quickly and start a business around that make money we'd say how we're taking advantage of a new opportunity in import exporting that allowed us to build a business that X in this amount of time without any tech skills without any experience you see how I wrapped the promise up which is essentially how you can build a business quickly without any tech skills without the things you hate but we presented as a new opportunity that's the absolute key to running good ads if you do not have a good promise that is easy and based around instant gains and removal of instant pains without the things they hate and it doesn't seem like a new opportunity it's not gonna hit as well okay so that's why when you're running your ads first off the number one thing you want to do is don't use the lingo that's an industry use the lingo that separates your offer because then people are gonna be curious about they're gonna want to click it then you need to nail down you need to understand that people in general this isn't this applies every person even even all the way up to Tony Robbins to a person that lives in a shack and 95% of things in our life we want the short path without effort I can look at my washing machine right now I have no idea how that thing works and if it required me to push 16 different buttons I probably have some really dirty dishes I look at my refrigerator I don't care how that thing works that is 100 years of engineering right there in my corner I don't give a damn and you need to understand you need to stop looking at your offers then in a special light or expecting people to take an extra effort if you have an offer for example Tyros I know people don't give a damn about tracking all people want to do is not lose money on their ads so I'm gonna swing at that I'm gonna try make it as push a button as possible it's the same thing with weight loss people don't want to learn discipline in a strong diet they want to press a button and lose weight without the things they hate okay for example attracting the things that people hate and the reason why people haven't gone and subtracting is they believe it's massive pain it takes coding skills it takes all sorts of crazy step-by-step it's just impossible to set up it's not worth the effort and even if you put in tons of time it's still not gonna be right that's the things they hate okay when people are thinking about starting a business the thing they hate is that they think they need tech skills they think they're gonna need to lose a lot of money they think they're gonna have to dedicate 20 hours a day when people want to lose weight they think they're gonna have to stop eating their favorite foods they think they're going to have to exercise three to four hours you're gonna notice all the best ads play to this hey get all the things you want without the things you hate and then they present as a new opportunity so very important so here's exactly how the ad script works there's multiple parts there's the first five seconds then there's the next 30 seconds and you're gonna watch me do this I'll have links to some of my best converting ads below as well then there's gonna be a five second part right here there's gonna be a thirty second part right here and there's gonna be another five second part right here and I want to walk you through what all these are so we're gonna start off an ad on YouTube you notice there's that five seconds then the person clicked through what I like to call this first so I have five seconds is your state your business okay so what a lot of people do on their ads it's a giant mistake as I try to get attention you really don't want the attention of people whose attention you don't want so I like this ID and it took them about ten seconds to actually state what that is about we're not running ads for coca-cola here usually when we're going to be running ads on YouTube we're trying to extract an audience we're not trying to sell to the biggest audience possible and for example one of my one of my proxies I scaled past eight figures cells to a huge audience but even that audience compared to the general amount of people that are on earth would only be about two out of a hundred people okay that's still a huge audience but you need to keep in mind that we want to get everybody everybody who's not interested in what we have to sell off the ad and we want to get everybody who is interested instantly hooked on the ad so what you need to do is you need to state your business and what we do is we make some type of curiosity peaking statement where a person wants the explanation it's based around our product or we even call out the person so for example the beginning of my hire us ads that you're gonna see I say do you run ads well if so this should terrify you you know who that doesn't terrify everybody doesn't run ants nobody doesn't want to add skips that ad okay because I know it's about I stated my business if I've served my Jairo sadness I started it off of like man this has been the key to everything for me this helped me build this big giant house this has been absolutely amazing I'd get so many people watching that have nothing to do with that I don't want to do that so you want to state your business at one of my consulting programs we help people grow their business with YouTube ads at the be end that ad I say this is you on Facebook ads or is your business stuck okay it's it's very clear what the ad is about and I believe I start another ad with this sold 18,000 SAS subscriptions for me an eighty two hundred high ticket procs anybody who's not selling anything online is gonna instantly be repulsed by that ad so I instantly get the people hook that I want and kick up all the other ones see what's gonna happen is if you start it with just attention seeking what's gonna happen is the people that you might actually want to watch that might not watch it because I don't think it's irrelevant they think it's not relevant to them so they're just gonna click that five second button and what you need to realize about YouTube traffic it's extremely broad it's extremely broad so it's more about extracting the audience so what's gonna happen is the people that you want to watch it might bounce off and the people that you don't want to watch it might watch then something you just got a disaster so that's the first thing then in the next 30 seconds you need to tell a story that shows this promise being fulfilled that ties into the first five seconds so what I'll do and my Huayra sad they'll say hey if you run ads this should terrify you because when I work with clients they're attribution is off by this much and here's exactly what happens this happens this happens this happens this happened in my business and I actually pressed this button or with proper attribution I solved all these problems so I show how my promise is being completed at my ecommerce training business I used to run we would start the ad by saying this is so-and-so he got these results in this time frame right here and he got these results by doing this weird thing with importing and exporting from China and so what he was able to do is do this did this and that and he was able to get this result lost off another ad saying this is how Instagram fluent sirs make money a sneaky way Instagram influencers make money hook and then I explained how it works which is through e-commerce marketing and how they did it and then I say if you want to learn ecommerce marketing click here so what I do is I show the promise being fulfilled you need to explain the situation went more so discuss your promise and all the things that they want without the things I hate so for example this is so-and-so they got this result they did this without XY and Z and they disobey taking advantage of this new opportunity and they did it in this timeframe they did it very quickly that applies to almost every every ad out there b2b b2c it doesn't really matter people want to result quickly and they want without the things they hate then in this five seconds right here what we're going to do is we're going to do the call to action say click here that I can't explain it all in this ad there's no way I could give you all the information needed for this ad so what you need to do is click this ad it's going to take you to a page where you'll be able to opt in will you'll be able to get more information yada-yada this is where we go for the click then what we can do in this next 30 seconds since we basically want to show then in the next 30 seconds what we want to do is we want to really hammer on benefits without the things they hate if you cool this out you're gonna see this you're gonna see how to save a ton of money on your ads instantly I'm gonna show you how to scale your ads and more importantly in just a few seconds you'll be able to optimize your pixely I had to find customers faster just like this person just like this person just like this person so use benefits without and then show the results of your customers and then we're gonna call for the click again this ad script right here I've use on YouTube for almost three years now I've spent millions and millions and millions of dollars of the script nothing defeats it nothing the feats it so what I want to do right now this let's actually watch one of my ads and all you'll see me doing this exact script from absolute scratch let's do this one this is one of my best converting ads at high rose right now okay so we're gonna go over one of my most successful ads at high rose and we're gonna kind of break down the script as we go through it together the thing I want to stress right now is that the template of the script always remains the same what's being said what's being angled to what's being promised will change there's no one-size-fits-all for what to say in this in this time frame the main thing is you state your business you show your promise being a cheat via story via results you express the result the person's looking for your big promise that you're using to lure them through the funnel you express that and show that being completed you show that result being there you present the problem and provide a solution in that next 30 seconds then we go for the call-to-action then we basically repeat the process that works over and over and over again now what's gonna be promised and that way it's gonna be presented is going to change over time so let's go through the ad real quick and I'll break this down so first thing I want to do is remember state your business if your business buys ads I can almost guarantee that your sales tracking is off by 30 to 40 percent ok cool I've stated my business who's this ad for people that buy ads who's this ad not for people don't buy ads okay if you're looking if you're looking to buy poodle's online this ad is not going to get your attention this this is repulsed everybody who's not my target market at this point in time I've stated my business now I need to illustrate the problem and the promise that I'm offering the person whether it's a way out of pain or a way to gain and I need any illustrate that being solved or I need to illustrate that problem being fixed if they click this ad and I mean guarantee and frankly should terrify you because I work with businesses at high rows every single day they were spending one thousand five thousand even thirty thousand dollars per day across the board the default is their sales tracking is off by thirty to forty percent this isn't rocket science when this happens one you're gonna turn off ads that are actually profitable this happens all the time and this is like giving yourself an inner case so what am i doing right here I'm presenting a big problem the whole promise of this ad is if you click here we'll be able to fix this problem so what I'm doing in this point right here in the story is I'm telling a story that causes a madam a large amount of pain illustrates the pain that they're probably in and then I offer solution out of that if we're doing a gain focused ad we'd make an ad where we're presenting the massive amount of gain through results or success that other people are having or you've had and we say hey look if you want to see how this works go here so we're presenting either massive gain and the promises if I click this ad they'll be able to see how this massive gain works or we're presenting massive pain telling a story that illustrates this and then going from there motion every single month to you're gonna spend money on ads that aren't actually making you money thus losing ten to fifteen percent of your ad spend and then when the ad platforms can't see the correct data they optimize around the wrong data this results in their targeting being less efficient and you having to spend way more to get a customer the result of this is hamstringing your business by 20% and then also wasting ten to fifteen percent of your ad spend that's five to six figures lost every year that you don't have to because you can click this ad and see that's how it is we present we present the promise through a story after doing our stating our business we present two promise as a story basically this is what's either happening to you this is what other was happened to other people or this is how this is the explanation for the big statement I just made in the state your business section do a basic story illustrating the results or lack of results or pain and then what we do is we do a call to action training that will show you step-by-step how to fix this in literal minutes and I've done this for nearly a hundred businesses I've done this for large businesses like Dean grows always mastermind calm I've done this for huge brands like groove life I've done this for e-commerce business okay so then what we do is we tell again in the next thirty seconds as we tell more stories these could be results these could be additional benefits but we want to go and tell additional things that back up that if they click this ad this is what they're gonna get okay whether it's hey I've done I've done this for other businesses hey here's more results hey in this training you're gonna see exactly this this and this and you want to hyper dig into the things you want to double down maybe on the gain or the pain and the in that they're gonna be able to escape out of it but abouts how it's going to work her info businesses I've done this for businesses where it's based around sales calls look if you're running ads on a good day your data is gonna be off by thirty to forty percent if you're not actively trying to find ways to solve this problem I will show you how to fix this problem in the little minutes if you cook this ad and I'm not exaggerating when I say taking a few minutes to just watch the hyper quick training I'm trying to get you to watch right here will save you five to six figures this year because think about it take the ad spin you spend every single month okay now take ten okay again I'm just making them count the money at this point that they're losing in this ad it's very simple it's very simple that's the same exact way that I'm gonna run every single script I'm going to start off state your business thirty seconds story that illustrates your state your business statement whether and you want to achieve massive potential gain are you are err you want to show massive potential gain for little effort or massive pain in a way out of pain with little effort as well so telling a story about how other people have done that telling a story about how you've done that going over to numbers and stats that you see that back up what you see these are great ways to achieve this these are great ways to push the person through that that's a great way to tell a story and so that's what you want to achieve you want to either show massive gain without the things they hate massive pain are escape from pain without the things they hate which you in that instance what you want to do is cause pain and then show a way out of the pain by clicking the add you want to make your call to action and then you want to double down on the benefits showing more results that your users or customers of Godin I an explaining or doubling down on the pain or gain that they can get into so this is an example right here I talked about results and then I talked about how much money to losing adding pain and I talked about again how easy would be to fix that it click this ad so basically state your business tell a story that illustrates the big promise that you're pruning people through that brings people through your funnel call to action illustrate the benefits the pains the results over again do another call to action okay that's all I'm doing right here and you can see again at the end of that 15 percent of the paycheck and just give it back just throw it away and then take the other 30 percent and blow it on pokemon cards it's disturbing I don't like watching it so I'm begging you just click to sad watch the hyper cook training and we'll fix your tracking just like all the businesses you're about to see it okay and so then what we're gonna do at the end of that I did a final call to action and then what I do is I show what I like to do at the end of a YouTube ad is you want to just have a screen that shows results or testimonies you don't want the ad to just end you want the ad to have a clear ending where you can see for this minute right here it just shows these results okay so the user clearly knows that the ad is done I clearly know what the ad is done and then it's time to click and you want to have this because a lot of people just watch the ad to the end and and we'll end and start that video then they can't get back to the ad so have a good 30 seconds where the person needs to click and if you follow this template right here not every ad is gonna be a homerun but this consistently works for me when I've gone off this script that gets really nasty really quick and the CP LS when I follow this type of script

hashtag hero nation what is going on this is alex becker and we got another pure value training video for you right now now again if you're new here you don't know what's going on i'm alex becker when i'm gonna shoot a day is a sales funnel that i've built that generates me $28 for every single person that goes down it now you look you're not gonna get that same result because i've been doing this for a really long time and i build a lot of seven-figure businesses now your expectations that we could probably go with is probably making three to five dollars for every single person who goes on funnel that's pretty good let's set our expectations shockingly low for ourselves okay maybe you'll get ten dollars because you're super cool but anyways what i'm gonna show you to do is how to build this funnel but then more importantly even with those kind of subpar results get 1000 to 1500 people a month into this funnel by suggesting it highly online and we'll get into what that means here in a second but I'm gonna show you get these thousand people a month into it for free and even if you get horrible results like one the two dollars for every single person goes in the funnel that's still like one in two thousand a month and more importantly this funnel crushes it with paid traffic for me in fact I pay about $4 for every single person goes into it what doc talking dollars back from completely cold nobody knows me traffic so if you're a veteran and this applies to you so that being said partly hero nation is giving you value without any BS without any fluff that's what you can expect whenever you see an email for me or something in your messenger inbox or when I send you a notification and messenger for a live stream so without further ado we're just gonna hop into the computer of truth and justice I'm gonna teach you the strategy alright guys so we're deep inside the computer truth and justice and what we're gonna be doing in this video is gonna be helping people at their smelly feet we're gonna make thousands doodles strudels of dollars by curing people of their extremely stinky feet so go find your friend go find your dad go find that creepy guy that lives down the street and tell him we get a solution for them okay we're not really gonna be doing that but I'm gonna apply this process to this because it makes me giggle so look this is what I want to show you and I want you to understand why it works first so here's a funnel right here and every single person comes down at their watches my YouTube videos generates me about twenty eight dollars and seventy five cents so I sent about sixteen hundred people down this last month and generate forty seven thousand dollars back that's really dang cool because that means if you can go and get the thousand people down that and let's say you suck and you're really bad and you never you never reach my levels of convincing people to buy stuff let's just imagine you get five dollars that still means if you get a thousand people down that thing you're gonna make like five thousand bucks if you build it correctly which this video is about now the even cooler thing about this is when I'm running this to cold traffic like just be an ad this generates me 10 dollars and 28 cents this is a little bit off it's probably close to the $12 for every single lead it comes down it so this is like people that don't know me have never bought anything from you three four and they're not like predisposed to buy anything you can see it still works really well so again this is gonna be kind of more closer to traffic that you're sending down it but your traffic will be warm because you're actually going and talking to people that are actually interested in it aka people have smelly feet but you need to understand one thing you need to understand one thing and that's why people buy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and this right here if you understand this you can get anyone to buy anything or you convince anyone to do anything this is the ultimate pen essential made-up big words of having people to buy anything on it and it comes down to two aspects are T are and what I like to call the belief changing I don't have a cool name for this one yet but we're gonna call it the go-cart of getting someone to buy your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so there are two things that must happen for a person to buy anything and they're actually pretty simple the first thing is they must respect trust and have rapport with you so what does this mean they must respect what you're saying they must believe you know what you're doing that you're cool that you're like the peak of what you do okay you're a respectable person so for example if you were a PhD and curing stinky feet you would be you'd have a lot of respect now the next thing you must do is trust you so they must trust the things that are coming out of your mouth no one believes what you're saying no one's gonna buy anything and then they must like you so for an example this would be like if you were really into camping out in the woods and you just kept getting attacked by bears okay and your friend was really good at camping in the woods and he was really good at fighting bears with a sword okay and so you respect your friend because he camps all the time okay nice laying many a bears it's like the Skyrim bears you ever get attacked by one of those things while playing Skyrim [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] terrible those things ruin your life now because he's done all this you respect him now because you've known him for a long time helped you a lot for free you trust him and because he's your friend and you've just spent a lot of time with him and he's never done you wrong you like him because of this if he tells you to buy this bear killing sword to go into the woods with you're gonna buy the sword if you like camping and you want to get you want to stop getting attacked by bears it's just gonna be that simple so first thing we must achieve is this with a person now the way you achieve these things specifically online is you must prove to someone you know what you're doing that build trust you mainly need to spend time with them and the build rapport you must help them if you can do these things with them prove you know what you're doing spend time with them to build trust without doing anything bad like all trust really is is time times not [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up that that's it like if you hang out with a friend and he constantly doesn't steal from you you're gonna trust him not to steal from you but if you hang out with a guy for 50 minutes he keeps like reaching awkwardly in your pocket you're probably not gonna trust him so that's really all Trust comes down to at least in this this instance right here and then rapport comes down to helping someone so if we can achieve these things right there we're gonna have a person that's gonna listen to us when we tell them to buy something so the only thing we need to do once we've achieved these things is we need to convince them that they want what we're selling and so here's where the person is right now they have stinky feet and we want them to not want to have stinky feet and we want them to buy our solution to stinky feet and so all the needs that happen right here is this is where the person is right now this is where they are now and this is where they could be and we need to make them hate loathe where they are right now and we need to make them desperately want to get to over here so here's where they are now with stinky feet and here's what they could go without stinky feet so what we then do is once they hate where they're at and they want to get to the better place there's special islands there Elysium what we need to just simply do is make what we're selling tie in perfectly before they want to go it's the bridge to get there now there's a bunch of things that have to happen for a person to want to get here right there's actually three very specific things that they must have the first thing that must happen is they must hate where they're at right now if they don't want to change they're not going to buy something so you must make them really want to change how do we make person want to kill their stinky feet remind them of when they went on a date and someone was like holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] your feet what is wrong with you I'm offended I'm offended this is the worst tinder date I've ever been on I'm gonna give you 1 star review I don't know how the app works I haven't been on there in a long time but anyways you remind him of that date that he went on where the girl went to the hospital because his feet stunk so bad and he's gonna be like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I haven't been on a date in like two years because I'm afraid of killing someone oh I rude a day if only if only my feet didn't smell so terrible so it's believed that our way of fixing the problem is awesome okay so that's the next thing we have to do we have to minam goh I hate where I'm at but this guy has a solution okay and so that's step number two and that's pretty easy we do that by showing us fixing the problem we show them maybe other people we'd help fix the problem we talked about how we fix the problem ourselves we we get a smelliness score we have if ten people sniff our feet and be like look how great our feet smell imagine the potential Majan the possibilities and then what we need to make them do is believe that our solution will work for them and if we can achieve those three things and then say hey by the way you can buy our solution right now for the special price of 399 they're going to buy it because they want to get to right here so we make them hate where they're at we make them believe our solution is awesome we make them believe that our solution will work for them and then what we do is we go and say hey if you give me some money I'll get you right here so we get them almost all the way there and we ask for some money okay it's kind of like we convince the person there's something super cool on this island across the river we just spent like days being like just this island there's like really fluffy blankets and exotic woods and if you go there you get out you get a pack of Pokemon cards it's only holographic but you got to get over there first and then we're like but by the way I have a boat to get there that's essentially all of it and the reason why that wouldn't normally work because the person be like you're just a weirdo in a boat who's trying to tell me about holographic Pokemon cards I don't believe you but if you achieve RTR they will believe you so how on earth do we do this thing so my solution to that is literally this email funnel that I'm showing you right here and so how it works is it's a four video email funnel and if you've been an internet marketing for any amount of time this is the four day launch process okay it's it's classical in fact I generate a million dollars in one week using this way back in a day but I realized how cool it was recently and I've just been using it all over the place and so what the video is what I do is the first video makes them not like where they're at the second video makes them understand why our way is better the third video makes them understand why this will work for them and why they can do it and then the fourth video closes and sells them something and so what we simply want to do is I'll even show you the elsi-8 the thing right here so look at this right here here's the funnel you can see here it is the funnel step-by-step goes through that and I know you're thinking oh now what Becker's gonna do is he's gonna try and send me down the funnel no actually if you look below this video I'll give you the funnel for free and you can sign up for market here it'll be template in your account there's actually a course that shows you the exact niche to pick and everything like that I'm not gonna hold back anything in this video but I'm also not gonna sit here for like three hours and tell you the exact niche the pic and exactly how to get all the free traffic there and do it like three minutes I'm just give me a summary and showing you what you can do if you want to get that you can get it for free by Trimark you hear a free below this video and that's that's the crazy offer that I have for you so you can sit back and relax and enjoy the rest of the training so as you can see this funnel right here just basically walks them through this process they jump in through a funnel on a page that looks like this okay and this is another one I have right here where we fix people's delivery I'm just doing the same almost exam exact funnel there as well and they come in they enter in their email address and then they go down a funnel that teaches them cool stuff about how to build an email business and then they signup to build an email business okay but this works in anything you can do this in curing stinky feet for example you could do this in camping you could do this with a supplement you could do this in learning how to play guitar it doesn't matter okay if you get someone through this process right here they buy that's that's just it and so what happens to this video series is they do all the things we need achieve our TR okay we show them that we know something by teaching them we build trust by only helping them and doing cool stuff with them and they spend time with us and then we make them like us because we're helping them out and then what happens is we walk them through the entire sales process and so this sales process multiplied by RT R equals the goecart of getting people to buy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay it's like the blue shell of getting people to buy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] so mario kart metaphors and so simply what we do is we just go and send them emails all right so here's the first email right here they sign up they get the first video then the next day at the end of the first video I say all right cool so we just we just taught you how to do this in the first video now the next day what you need to do is look out for this video we're gonna send you next video and so in this video so here is again how it works in the first video you just make them not like where they're at and show them how you got away from the same exact thing so if you've been attacked a lot by bears know what you'd be like dude have you ever been sleeping and then a bear just comes and like punches your wife in the face me too my wife used to really hate camping with me because for some reason the Bears had it out for her and she just be walking in a street and just pow a knuckle sandwich from a bear and she won't go camping with me anymore but then I showed her that hey I got this sword and so I can defend you from bears and be the alpha male the woods and so that's exactly what the Camilla they're gonna be like oh wow this sword sounds pretty cool in the second video you show them like you using the sword and like getting results and how the sword works and like how to parry bearer text with a sword okay and then what you do in the third video is and you basically just show them you defeating bears and like how it works and then be like and this is exactly how you'll defeat bears too now in the final video what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you and give you the sword in the final video you sell them the sword that's it now I'm not sure that will work in Facebook Ads because I think selling swords specifically to kill animals what is very anti liberal which is all Facebook is these days and I also think that swords are considered a weapon so you're just seeing a double whammy so I wouldn't suggest selling animal slaying swords on Facebook but any other thing will probably work and so how do we get traffic to this thing I'm gonna show you two really easy ways to get traffic to this so the first easiest way to get traffic to this is just using YouTube okay so check this out so the easiest way to get traffic on YouTube is check out like deadbeat Dan okay and good friend of mine he's awesome Wednesday one of my masterminds we were not like arch enemies like there's for people that have crazy headlines and giant money symbols all over their YouTube chat there's enough there's enough views for all of us anyways look at this most popular video how to make $100 a day it's sixteen to seventeen years old now if we go to my channel and look at my most popular video you can see that my most popular video on my channel has almost the same exact headline right here besides this one here's another hack just if you want to get lots of views on you just go buy a thousand overwatch loop boxes will cost you $800 maybe $1000 to do it I did it two years ago but that works really well but anyways you can see this video right here almost the same exact headline and so what you can do is you can go find other videos in the niche that you want to get into and copy their thumbnail copy their headline and at the end of the video just make cool videos like make 10 of them just copying other people's headlines and stuff like that in the end of the video and I know this goes against the algorithm but this will get you a couple people in every single day like let's imagine every video you get up will send you like three people day so just get up like ten people okay and so then we're gonna do is we're gonna link to our little funnel in the bottom the video and then that video is just fake hey so you've watched in this video how I've slayed bears in the woods and I'm probably going to jail soon so you should probably go check out this boot camp that I have below and we'll show you how you too can protect yourself from bears in the woods now what you can also do is go to forums alright so here's like a war warrior forum and it's not full of warriors it's actually full of all sorts of people I'll just leave it that but anyways it's a really good example because if you go and hang out in forums and Facebook groups and you just go and answer people's questions so say there's like a forum and I'm gonna tell you real quick slang bears in the woods is not a big not a big forum it's it's not and I'm gonna tell you right now slang bears in the woods is not a huge niche but if you have a niche like learning how to play guitar something like that there's tons of forums out there about this stuff and most farms allow you to put a signature in there so what you do is you go on the forum and don't be like a dick and just be like hey boot camp boot camp and his poster all over the place but go help people out and then link to your boot camp with a clever headline below it just like this guy is doing right here see and see what he's doing and then you just send people down that so if you go out there and you go and get like I don't know five people day from Facebook and then like or five people day from just uploading a bunch of YouTube videos and like five people day from forums it's like ten people day equaling 300 people a month and if you get $5 for every single person who goes down your funnel if you build it the right way then you're going to go and generate like 1500 bucks a month and what I suggest you sell at the end of their funnel you can do a fill it procs you could do drop shipping products I suggest selling a membership that's 47 bucks a month because if you get one person to buy that and they stay for a year that's a $500 sale and that right there is what I think is the easiest way to make money because you just build a really convincing funnel that walks people through the most the bestest sales strategy ever I mean this is this is what it takes to get people to buy any sales process ever it's this this is really all that's going on and the better you do these things and the more RTR you have the more it's gonna work for example Apple has so much arty art they don't even have to do this they just walk in and they're like hey I got this gizmo and it has a fruit on it buy it now and everyone's like ok that's how powerful RTR is so the more RTR you can achieve the easier it is to get people to buy stuff so guys that is the training for the day and I think I've gone for like 25 minutes here I haven't held anything back that being said if you just want to get like you actually want to do this if you just go below there's a free trial to market here oh you click it inside your account what will be there is the exact funnel is the exact stuff I'm building this with you can actually have like the funnel templated inside your account and then inside the account is literally a course that shows you exactly how to go out there and what niche to pick if you don't have a niche if you don't know what you're doing if you're lost in life it shows you exactly what to promote exactly how to build your membership site if you don't know the build a membership site it shows you exactly how to build the funnels and then it also shows you exactly how to go and get free traffic from YouTube Instagram Facebook forums it's all in there it's all for the price of free just for trying market hero and you can cancel before you pay anything if you're just a cheapo and you don't you don't want to pay for anything so totally up to you you should probably go check it out because we got the best delivery the best funnel builder the best tracking and everything on the market or you can just sit here and be frustrated and try and build this out of sticks and logs and whatever I don't know you can try and run this from your gmail account but that'd be really hard so that being said hashtag hero nation that is the video of the day if

hashtag cure nation what is going on this is alex becker and you are on your third open email from us you open two more and you get that six hundred dollar course free now what you're gonna see in today's video is a live storm i did that basically breaks down here let me show you how I've grown my channel from zero to over three hundred and close to three hundred twenty thousand subscribers as I make this video and more importantly check out some of these stats in this videos you can see this video right here a hundred sixty two thousand views 158,000 186 two hundred ten eighty to two hundred seventy seven and it just goes on and on and on so what I'm gonna show you in this video is exactly how I go and get hundreds of thousands of views on videos and no it's not because it subs subs don't actually matter on YouTube and most importantly let's tie this back in the business it's not just about getting famous on YouTube and putting a cool youtuber it's about going out there and actually making money in doing this you can see right here I generate about eight thousand dollars a month just posting on YouTube but more importantly the viewers that come on here I will routinely generate about five thousand to ten thousand dollars a day just retargeting and with super cheap ads and I want to show you the ROI on these things so I'm inside my ours dashboard what you can do what's so cool about YouTube is every person that views your video becomes a retargeted person on a list for you this means you can target someone who knows you who probably likes you because they just watch your video and is interested in what you're selling because they just watched your video on the topic so this is a really specific audience I have right here of people that watch my marketing videos not so much my Star Wars videos and you can see right here I spent about fifty five thousand dollars and about three hundred twenty eight thousand dollars back now the thing here about AdWords is the DES tracking is probably way up so we'd probably be closer about five hundred thousand dollars from the fifty five thousand dollars and actually if you go and look at the last 30 days right here the last thirty days you spent about five thousand dollars did probably $50,000 in sales back the advertising and this is not like other advertising where you're going and marketing the people that are cold then what we're doing is remarketing people that are already predisposed to buy therefore they're gonna watch more so it probably only takes one cent again to watch the view that's how much it will cost and Adwords and we're gonna be making like a 10 X or Y without too much effort just like you're seeing here and that's what you're gonna see today the one thing I want to

videos on YouTube on top of the eight thousand dollars a month in Adsense on top of all the branding and exposure that we're getting on YouTube if you are doing a business and you are not on YouTube I think you're insane and this stream is gonna make it very clear why let's get this going guys alright so welcome to live stream I got all set up right let me load up my little doodle pad right here and what are we gonna be talking about tonight guys what are we gonna be talking about tonight's nothing but the legendary YouTube by the way if you're my Instagram we get the vote on what I talk about each day on these live streams and so you should definitely be there so what I'm gonna be breaking down today guys it's a little strategy you guys asked me to do again which is all about YouTube and look a lot of people are kind of reluctant than getting the YouTube let me just kind of show you like some daily stats right here let me just go blood up the screen drop this down move this aside look how good we're getting into the stream and stuff right here but guys look I'm gonna show you a simple little strategy right here and this comes from a whole bunch of other ads right here but here's about what we've done today did about 28 that let me actually refresh then stripe for you guys then about 28,000 actually got thirty thousand dollars in sales about ten thousand dollars in sales and PayPal today and here's our ad spend about eleven thousand dollars on YouTube and so if you want to see how we're doing that you should probably listen up because what I'm gonna show you today is we're about ten thousand dollars of that income comes from it's actually using free traffic and using a very simple retargeting method I'm going to show you to turn that free traffic into customers now look you can also go and use the traffic I'm about to show you you can get sales for free but if you're smart you're gonna do the retargeting okay so this is gonna be a pretty spiffed assed extreme so give me a three if you're excited because we get this going by the way guys we are giving away a copy of H com 2020 live on the stream and the way I'm gonna pick out the person who gets it is it's a person who's most active in the comments so if I see you commenting a lot I see being a cool cat I see you give me way too much attention because I'm very insecure I need it there you get H come 2020 so that's like a two thousand dollar course so guys look I'm just gonna dive straight into the topic of the evening let's make sure I get everything loaded up right let me expand this a little bit so you can see very clearly come on down come on down there we go well pal okay that really didn't change anything at all but it made a big difference like I just tell me it did so look guys let's get into the topic at hand all right so my notes right here great so what I want to talk about first up guys is why you want to be doing YouTube right now because you're probably thinking you know why on earth would I want to make a YouTube channel and it's very very important okay because I want you to understand exactly what happens when people come to your YouTube channel so let's imagine go on put a bit Oh up on thank you thank you over all the people saying hey I see it we got like a ton of people pouring on right now and like a few live stairs ago I tried to answer questions and it just gets crazy because I never Annie back and forth for trolls and stuff like that so if you put a video up on YouTube what YouTube is gonna do if you use the algorithm the way I'm gonna show you in this livestream today and by the way if you hop off you don't get to see the rest of the livestream so don't hop off because I got something actually crazy free thin okay I'm gonna give you like a zillion dollars worth of stuff so look when you upload a video if you use the algorithm the way I'm gonna show you what it allows you to do is get thousands of people let's say ten thousand people to the video now this is gonna happen every single video but if you use the algorithm the way I'm gonna show you this this video you can consistently if you're just starting off get two thousand to five thousand views and by the way it has nothing to do subscribers whatsoever so let's imagine we're in the camping niche right here and we're able to send this amount of traffic to our video by the way there is no other platform on earth there is no other website on earth that's gonna give you ten thousand free visitors maybe Instagram if you get like a really nice post up there but there's no platform on earth that is gonna send you ten thousand visitors warm them up to your offers and get them to like you and become customers for free there just isn't period look at Logan Paul look at Jake Paul there is no platform on earth that is gonna send you that amount of business for free okay maybe vine back in a day Instagram to a little extent but look this is where you want to build it but I want you to understand one thing if you get a thousand people to a video what just happened is you did something very important okay so a lot of you guys probably come to your website again everybody pouring and give me a quick one if you can hear me someone said okay okay I'm listening I like it somewhat everybody saying such mean things about Logan Paul be nice to Logan Paul guys he's he's apologized he's apologized for his mishaps okay so let me make sure that many chat went out all right so look I'm gonna tell you why when you probably send people to your website they don't turn in the customers okay it's probably because you suck at your website first off your app site probably doesn't look great and you probably aren't selling too well but the very bare minimum I want you to really think about a time you went to a website and bought something where you didn't know anything about the business or who it was okay now I want you to think about a time now where you saw a video of somebody your you've got to know somebody a little bit do their videos you got to know their brand or you got to know the brand overall and then you went to their website and it was really really ugly but because you really like the person's videos and that even though the sales process isn't good but you like the person's videos you bought why does this happen why can't a site if it looks really good and you got sent to it but you don't know what it's about why would you not convert there when you're converting at an ugly website with really bad Sun it's because of this rapport trust and respect now look if you have rapport with somebody it means you like them okay you like the person you like what they're doing trust you believe what they're saying okay and respect you believe they are the best at what they're doing all right there you believe they're very knowledgeable if you have all three of these things it is infinitely easier to get someone to buy something okay and don't worry we're gonna get to the algorithm how to get all the free traffic how to get the sales even exactly how we're doing this we're spending like 11,000 making like 40,000 we just made like another thousand bucks right now we're on the stream about another 10k in PayPal right now if you want to know what to do that don't worry we're gonna get that but look if you have these things it's gonna be extremely easy to sell even if your sales skills are awful okay and you want to look you want to pay attention this right now if your sales skills are awful because look if you're watching this right now you probably not you probably good internet marketing you're probably beginner most of you are maybe 10 percent of people here have a business it's working that's fine that's fine but if you have these things right here it's gonna be so much easier to close sales you guys might have seen sales pages I put up online the reason why those sales pages work even though they're really boring okay there's a few like the hero sales academy sales page has like nothing on it we have like 2,000 members in there right now it's also because the contents amazing but people don't know that but they come from the YouTube channel they check and I go wow that's awesome so what just happened what YouTube is gonna do for us is when we put a video up online and then it sends traffic to us for free what YouTube is gonna do is it's two things first off it's going to give us a little way to run ads to every single person that viewed that video no more on that later on but more importantly what it's going to do is it's going to send people to that video and what are we gonna build rapport trust and respect respect okay get it it's all about the respect all right I'm gonna make a lot of Logan Paul jokes tonight so look once you have those things if you can get this person to go to your website then you're gonna be in a very good position now here's the problem though on your videos if you link to your website you're gonna see your videos not get as much traction as they could be now you can still sell from your videos once you warm up the algorithm a little bit to your channel okay I'm gonna talk about how to do that here but more importantly guys what you need to understand is we really don't want to sell in our videos we want to use our videos to get tens of thousands of views and I'm going to show you how to do that and so what I want to break down to you is my exact strategy okay I'm gonna show you my xx tragedy it easily generates 10k a day it's it's very very very simple and you're gonna understand it right away but give me a one if all that makes sense real quick okay someone said one more Logan Paul reference people don't like the Logan Paul references guys guys come on guys it's it's it's I forgot what's what's his sayings I don't know that my Logan Paul sayings anymore what are they no gangster alright I don't I don't know I haven't watched enough I used to watch his channel a lot for giggles but I don't do anymore all right so you guys are clearly getting it good good all right so the next thing we want to get into is look how does a strategy work it's very simple so if you go to my channel you're gonna see that I'm gonna actually lower it where's my channel let me go to my actual channel you know that thing I can see myself streaming to myself right now is it am I in the future because that's what's going on if you guys saw my can you die video you know that I'm technically in a different time warp than you but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do that alright so look if you look my channel right now I want to point one thing out I have 256 thousand subscribers but I'm gonna show you something if you look at my videos right here it's really hit and miss so if I make a Star Wars video 143 thousand views I make a video games video 5k views I make a video on building a business about 13 K views it's pretty obvious right now that subs don't really matter okay I can show you a lot of Shopify bloggers I can show you a lot of people that have way less substance I do to get more views than I do and that's because what YouTube looks at is not your sub count sadly I would love if it just sent it my video to all my subscribers that's not how it works okay what YouTube is gonna do is gonna look at the metrics behind your video and if you get the right metrics on your video what is then going to happen is YouTube is gonna blow that video up so doesn't matter if you have subs or not and so I noticed this a while back and so what I will do is I make videos using a very specific strategy and I use a headline a combination of the headline the thumbnail and going for a high watch time to get YouTube to blow up my video for example this video right here the Star Wars video got 143 thousand views in about a week okay that right there is worth probably like fifty to eighty thousand dollars for me I'm gonna explain why in a second okay but just understand that it's about 50 to 80 thousand bucks to me and I'm gonna show you exactly how I do that so what you're gonna notice is if you get a video that has a high watch time gets a lot of clicks and has a good thumbnail YouTube is gonna blow it up so what I do is I make these videos and I'm gonna get YouTube to send me anywhere from 10k to 100k views on average now if I make an entertainment based video I'm usually gonna get that hundred K views and so what YouTube then does is it gives me a retargeting list of let's imagine this alright so I make a shop of a video it gives me the 10,000 people who just watched that video okay and so I can go right here into my shared library and AdWords I can go to audiences and I can literally find every single person that's viewed that video and I'm gonna show you how to get these views here in a second if you're feeling a little bit overwhelmed just bear with me so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create an audience of anybody that viewed a video from my channel okay so this is I literally have an audience inside my account I'm not gonna scroll down to it right now but it has like I think like 8 million people on it or something like that but more importantly iWitness I wanted to go and target people that have watched in the past two days so these are people that just watch my videos these are gonna be the people most likely to convert so what I'm gonna do is it's gonna give me a retarding list of 10k to 100k people and so right after they watch that video what's gonna happen is I'm gonna send and add to them on AdWords say hey I noticed you just watched this video or if the person just watched a video on Shopify what I'm gonna do is I'm going to send them to our HTM 20/20 webinar okay so let's imagine this I get 10,000 people to watch my Shopify video and if I can get those 10,000 people and then I can get I don't know 500 of those 10,000 people who just watched my video they opted in for a webinar I converted about 3% on that webinar okay so 250 show up that's about 7 sales ok that's about 7 sales about 14,000 dollars in my pocket now what's going on right here if I get like a hundred K Beus or something like that I can do the same exact thing I said hey this is Becker I saw you just watched my videos come and tend to live event today we're building a business if I get 100k views man I just get 30 people to watch that that's 60,000 bucks does that make sense but why do those people opt-in why are they so much cheaper you need to understand that when I run an ad to these people usually right here I'll show you um I'll show you this alright so check this out here's a perfect example of me doing this right here so I'm gonna do last let's see last week okay so it costs me usually about seven eight dollars to get people to sign up for a webinar now these are people that IRA targeted from video views and my subscribers and stuff like that and if you actually go back I was paying about $1 per opt-in for our webinar all right a dollar per opt-in okay and the amount we were generating per day is about 8,000 bucks a day at $1 per opting we're spending probably about 500 bucks to make 8,000 back that's what you understand because these people they've just watched the video they just watched you and you just gained rapport trust and respect then you ask them to attend a webinar when they on this kind of rapport trust and respect hi and what's gonna happen is boom they buy and they convert much higher and they opt-in much higher so give me a one if that makes sense so far if you having some aha moments yes RTR go to the RTR dance alright anyone remember the Macarena I was watching this video the other day like that brought the Macarena and I remember when I was like in fourth grade doing that that's that's how you know you're cool alright first person I want to see I want to see Macarena chants in the chat right now this gives this really increases your odds of getting H come 2020 alright first person to say hey Macarena gets twenty cool points in my book alright alright we're done we're done there we go there we go thank you guys all right that gives you 20 cool points if you put it in there I'll remember you at the end of this and we're giving out those things so guys how do we get these views all right how do we get these views pretty simple okay so what I'm gonna do is let me make sure I'm on pace with my notes is I want to go and let's imagine we're in the camping niche and I use the camping niche because it's so easy to sort of explain what all right so let's go to YouTube and let's type in make sure I'm screwing the same thing alright cool so let's go and type in survival and let's go find some channels okay so um primitive technology right here so there's three tactics you can use to consistently get views and I just use the if you watch my videos the ones that actually go and try and get views for I use one of these three topics or strategies every single time so I'm gonna show you the first strategy right here so I'm gonna go back to my channel I don't know why I came over here we're live everything's just gonna be awful if you want better teaching this is why you watch the videos if you want a complete mess of a thing you come to the live streams alright so let's go and look at this video right here alright so read the headline right here how to make a thousand dollars a day at fifteen years old or as a beginner alright eight hundred eighty one thousand views now we're gonna go to my buddy deadbeat Dan's deadbeat super affiliate alright and I love Dan by the way I'm not giving him poop or anything right there so look look at his most viewed video how to make $100 a day as a lazy 16 to 17 year old do you see the similarity in headlines and you see the similarity and thumbnails yes so what you want to do if you want to have a successful YouTube channel go and look at other channels and I'm telling you this copy their headlines and thumbnails and put a slight twist on them like Dan did right here by the way I copied an headline headlines too I copied an the syllables head we all copy each other's headlines okay no one none of us are original we're marketers all right if we were original we'd be you know going to Japan and filming stuff in the woods and and yelling on trampolines like Logan so look we're gonna go back to my channel man I want to actually let's go that survival Channel survival Channel there we go so we go over here to primitive technology and I mean these guys look like they haven't made I mean if who doesn't want to go live in a hut in the woods and sleep and a pile their own you know have you ever seen that show naked and afraid good gosh that this place I'm like the the what you might call it the National Geographic Channel or whatever this is one chant it plays it 24/7 straight I don't understand how that show caught wind but it's weird don't go google it so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go look at this guy's channel let's go look at his videos and let's organize them by popularity all right bingo bingo there we go so primitive technology bow and arrow alright so we could obviously make a video on how to build a bow and arrow in the woods something like that how to build your forge in the woods how to make mud bricks alright primitive technology how to make mud bricks or something like this like these people really effing like making mud bricks I don't see the appeal but 22 million people than six months so look let's imagine we are selling something that I didn't cover what we're gonna sell let me back up and do that so let's imagine we have an e-commerce store okay and we have are we up to we could have do this two ways we have a survival course or we have an e-commerce store the ecommerce store sells tents and our site sells a survival course okay easy enough so those are what you're gonna sell and you can get the tents by going to aliexpress.com and we're gonna do tents so what are you gonna do if you don't know what drop shipping is we're basically gonna go then find a tent on here alright so you see this one right here Kim can pop up down out there camping tip quick and automatic opening tent for whatever all right so it's 40 bucks we could easily sell this tent for $150 from our website then what we do is we come to this website we buy the tent and we ship is the person that bought that's called drop shipping and it's done in every story you've ever been in whole food 7/11 the dollar store maybe I don't know yeah pretty much every store ever so knowing that now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go and say all right so how can we get people to our tent or a survival store we're gonna go and make videos just like this teaching people how to survive in the woods maybe using the tent that we're gonna sell in our store or we're gonna teach people how to survive in the woods and then afterwards tell them hey look by the way if you like this video come check out my course and the way we're gonna do that we'll make videos like this channel is made okay and copy the videos and we want to do about three to four videos a week is that a lot of videos not really actually it at my usual pace no not at all but look if you can rack up a subscriber list of or not even a subscriber list a view list of 10 20 50 thousand people that is enough to make six figures a year easy I'll show you how here in a second now the next way you can go and get a lot of views is you want to go and copy trends so check what I'm doing on my channel alright so we're gonna go to my channel pop on over so I want to show you some of my most popular videos we're gonna go order them by most popular so look you're gonna notice how I blogged about Star Wars a lot why well first off the last Jedi did you see that it's offensive it's offensive okay I'll just leave it at that Luke Skywalker has no business doing the things he was doing with that fat little bubble creature down by the creek alright that was inappropriate and I felt like I was watching an adult film Luke Skywalker is one of the actors that was not cool alright but anyways a lot of people were also very pissed off they shared my same feelings about this and so I noticed there's a lot of trending anger about the movie and so I made a bunch of videos on it look at this video 275 thousand views 400,000 views do you keep going down there's another one right here 143 thousand views look what do you want to do is you want to look out for trends so what were some really good videos you could have made a video about this last week to get a lot of views the Zuckerberg thing I believe the Han Solo trailer came out and what you want to do is you want to look for relevant news big news to Syria thing with Trump okay you want to make videos about them and then tie that into your topic why it's gonna bring a lot of viewers to your channel now this isn't the best way to get organic viewers that are really interested in your topic but this will bring a lot of people in now the final way to get a lot of views is what I like to call feats of strength and this is where you go and do something ridiculous and really this isn't the best way to get views it's a really good way to grow your channel but I would really start off with the headline thumbnail tactic I talked about but check this one out here rich kid buys over a thousand overwatch loop boxes so I went and bought 1,000 overwatch loot boxes I think it cost me like nine hundred dollars to do that I made my money back in the Adsense alone from this video so I think I think if you get a million views on a video it's probably about a thousand to two thousand bucks you're gonna make so that's about the give or take it depends on your channels value and stuff like that but what you do is you go and do something crazy not super crazy but there's all sorts of things you can do for example I get go I can go get in the Ferrari and go pick people up in uber okay that would be a really viral video you can make videos comparing certain things like here's one $100 steak versus thousand dollar steak okay check out this one 27 million views so what you want to do is you want to create videos that trigger a question okay so you could do $10 survival tent versus $1,000 survival tent you could do let's just do like a survival video right here alright so you could have watch me survive in the woods for one week I'm not saying that would be the best idea right there but look how many views this thing got 1.5 million views you make one of those videos and I would do maybe one of these videos once a month you're gonna get lots of views you can turn those views easily easily into customers so those are the three ways to get views okay give me an X if you're tracking right now give me those x's and remember the people that are most that are coming the most interacting the most you're up to win age comm 2020 okay let me make sure awesome look at all those X's I like it I like the participation we're gonna do the X dance now donate some money to I think you can do that in YouTube domine donate me ago the first person to find a way to donate a dollar on this channel I'm gonna give you H comm 2020 to donate a dollar alright and if we get $10 and donated i will donate them to save a puppy or something I don't I don't I don't know okay I like all those X's guys I'm enjoying this alright so look now how do we get people to view our video very simple so the next thing you want to do is you want to go through you need to understand there's two things that control whether people or whether your video explodes all right it's it's clicks you're right and watch time now there's tons more stuff that goes into videos being viewed but if you can consistently nail these two you're gonna be okay so CTR is handled by those tactics I just talked about alright it's handled by those now watch time how do you get a high watch time it's very simple one you're not gonna always get a good watch time but you need to make your watch time go about eight minutes if you can get about eight minutes of watch time on average on your video you're going to do pretty well so what you want to do is you want to upload videos are about 15 to 18 minutes in length alright if you go look at my most popular videos the the Star Wars ones for example they're about 20 minutes of rant now when you're making these videos what you need to do in the first minute is you need to hook people the most important thing is you hook people what a lot of people do is they say hey subscribe to my channel by the way I make videos on this and man I really love mac and cheese I'm gonna go get some mac and cheese real quick be right back just remembered I'm in my garage I don't have any mac and cheese guys but look guys here's what the video is about today it's about this book it's really good see that's what most people do in their videos that's when people click away and that's why you see so many people if their YouTube channels and they get like 50 views per video it's because they do stuff like that hook people in the first minute so if I'm making a video about how to make 10,000 a month on shop I'm gonna say look in this video I'm going to start it off with a crazy intro and the first 30 seconds make people go what's going on here then the next 30 seconds what I'm gonna do is say hey look in this video you're gonna see step by step how to make $200 a day on Shopify without without any investment and you're gonna see able to do it in 32 seconds whatever creates curiosity and then get into your topic and don't stop progressing spend about 30 seconds per point and then keep moving keep moving keep moving keep moving especially if you're doing educational videos especially if you're doing educational videos if you're doing entertainment base videos show some emotion get a little bit angry rant a little bit people like angry rants they just do that's just that's just a side talk but what you want to do is just make sure to make your videos and progress very rapidly you don't need high levels of quality you don't need this a two thousand dollar camera take out your iPhone turn it sideways get a white light shoot some videos okay there are tons of videos online where people have made tons of views just from an iPhone okay so give me a three real quick if you're still tracking you're getting this it's all making sense that's how you go and get that's how you use the algorithm and look guys one thing you understand as a lot be you might be tempted to go back to you like your SEO roots cuz i got into SEO and back when i first go to youtube you could use PP ends and all sorts of stuff the rink don't do that anymore you just want to go for watch time and click-through rate and while there might be some SEO tricks still out there look my SEO trick makes videos about star wars make videos buying loot boxes and video games get a ton of views alright shooting threes like the NBA yeah I like that there we go awesome alright so how do we make money now how do we make money so this is very simple so we're gonna make these videos we're gonna upload them and I would really encourage you to do three videos a week three videos a week is what you need to do why because I just increases your odds it's kind of like playing a slot machine not every video is gonna work I mean like look at some of the videos on my channel I have some real stinkers okay I have some real stinkers like this one right here like check out this one right here like I made a video game video none of you guys watch this video game video not nice not a nice thing to do guys okay so knowing that you want to upload many videos as you can and you want to kind of play around with your topics like obviously I can get a lot of views if I use a celebrity name or I go in there and I use like a big trend or something like that so now that we're doing that guys we want to go and create an ad so how do we create an ad very simple you want your ad to be about a minute in 30 seconds the first five seconds you need hook them and how do you do that you pitch them on what they're gonna get without all the things they hate hey do you want to make $4,000 a month without investing or working hard hey do you want to go camping in the woods but keep getting attacked by bears hey do you want do you want to be more attractive to girls but you don't want to lose weight here's my magic secret dude or dudette all right so that's what you do okay what I would do honestly you should just make a video where it starts off and it says you're fat and then and then just yell that and then obviously everybody will pay attention and be like and you should be like you're fat if you were 20 or more pounds overweight by the way you don't have to do that here's our special sitting yeah don't don't do that but that would be kind of funny you might see that ad in the future if I can get that approved all right so look after the first five seconds where you hook them we want to spend about 30 seconds explaining how they're gonna get all those things so hey do you want to go camp in the woods but you keep getting attacked by bears well you know that this special tent that we showed in one of our videos it's been displayed on our channel Survival super dudes calm it's been displayed on our channel and what's happened is when we put in this tent bear attacks have reduced by 90% and we didn't have to do a thing we can sit in there and eat our SpaghettiOs and no bears are doing anything to us it's it's a maze it's amazing and so what we're doing today is we're actually giving a huge discount on this tent because you've viewed our channel and so if you click right here we're gonna give you 50% off and so what you want to do on this part of the video for about 10 seconds is give them a call to action saying look we're giving this tent 50 percent off on our store today we're giving 50% off our survival course you need to come here right now and if you don't come here right now the Bears are gonna get your SpaghettiOs nobody likes sharing their SpaghettiOs alright so what you didn't need to do is another three seconds is you need to explain the benefits say like look this tent is insulated if a bear touches it they catch on fire instantly they don't tell PETA but yeah it's amazing tent and then you need to close in the next ten seconds telling them hey the tents here hey the tents here that's it you do that you're gonna be doing really well and you I want you to understand most ecommerce experts they run an ad the people that don't know about them in their brand therefore the ad doesn't work if you run your ad to a person that respects you have rapport with and trust you RTR all right even though I set out to order okay if you were if you're running out to a person who has RTR especially coming up the high of watching your video you're gonna see I'm not joking five hundred percent higher conversion rates why because they know who you are they know who you are and they like what you have so how do we go and do this once we have the ad how do we go and create the ad it's really simple first one go down here we're gonna go to our shared library and AdWords and we're gonna go and create a of anybody dispute our videos in the last two days easy okay there's a few videos on the channel too to kind of teach you some bit more and I'm also gonna give you a way to like do this here in a second now next thing you want to do we're gonna go and create an ad I'm gonna keep this one pretty simple okay and for everybody turning in right here just for everybody hopping on just show any kind of what we're talking about we're talking to how we're doing an extra 10k day on a YouTube you can see we spent about eleven thousand dollars a day and we've already made about another thousand dollars we're doing about we're at about forty thousand in sales today from all the businesses actually I think I don't know where we got we got another processes are right here and we got PayPal per source wave and stuff like that so it's going good going good so if you're interesting that and listen up so what we're then going to do is we're gonna go and create an that so how do we create an ad we're just gonna go right here and we're gonna get create an ad do I'm not gonna show it let me just show you can I have what it looks like so there you go really simple you just link to your page and everything like that and what you want to do in your video targeting is you come over here we're gonna go to remarketing and then we're just gonna simply target what are you doing we're gonna target everybody that's viewed see all sorts of videos like if you viewed this video right here I'm gonna target you with the consulting ad if you viewed you with this if you viewed this ad it just goes on if you viewed a Shopify video I'm gonna target with this alright this ad set this one hundred forty thousand people right here is worth like Lisl e 5k a day to me so I'm just gonna go and do recent views if you viewed my video in the past one day hit save boom we're running an ad and here's the most beautiful thing guys it's gonna be dirt cheap to do this and so instead of going out there like every other person out there and targeting a bunch of people that don't know you you're gonna start your first Shopify store only targeting people or your first digital marketing store whatever targeting people that like that have did you have rapport with trust with and respect now here's the thing let me let's look at a few ways you could really monetize this first off imagine you had a survival brand or any brand losing weight juicing shaving cats if you're into that type of thing and what you're gonna do is we can go and then target them let's imagine we get us membership and it's 47 bucks a month and we give them a free trial so let's imagine that these 10,000 people that view a video we get 200 of them to sign up for a free trial 200 if we get just fifty percent of those people to convert that's a hundred people that's forty seven hundred bucks a month year-round that's forty that's like about fifty sixty thousand bucks a year one video 10,000 people gimme an X if that kind of gets you excited like that if you see the potential right there that's why I think reoccurring memberships especially where you coach is the best way to get started ever pretty cool right yeah one video 10,000 people let's imagine guys you upload a video every single day or three times a week for a month and you're able to rack up 30,000 retargeting viewers you got these people for free all you need to do is get 200 of them to convert now what else let's imagine you have a brand where you teach people for lack of better words let's say you help businesses that's a little name one you help people learn Facebook Ads okay you make a video about Facebook advertising and then you retarget people right after soon let's say you're not gonna give them any views both so you get 3000 views you retarget everybody right after asking what they want to sign up for a consultation call where you'll help them with your Facebook Ads if you get 3000 people and you get to that with you for a thousand dollars a month paid traffic management that's 2,000 bucks a month 24 K a year from one video that's the greasy hot goodness I'm talking about right here that's the bigger picture you need to look at right here for example guys if I make a Shopify video Oh wonder what I'm you've never seen me be one of those yeah this keeps going like here we go ten days hundred dollars a day hacking shop by sellers 10k 10k so I got 24 people right there so 24 K people if I get 10 of those people to buy H come 2020 I just made 20 great okay okay but if I can get three of those people at a twenty four thousand you've just watched this video that's sixty thousand dollars in my bank account and it's a little bit more obvious how I'm able to go and generate see I just made another 500 bucks is sitting right here okay so it's pretty it's pretty obvious how I'm able to go out there and generate an extra 30 to 40 sometimes 50k a day on even crazy days eighty thousand dollars a day just going out there and using a lot of this is a my only tactic I run a lot of cold traffic ads as well a lot of cold traffic ads but this right here is responsible for about an extra tank a day and sales so I have a question for you guys how many people give me a three

got for me tonight what questions do you have someone said we get the hero sales academy plus VMA yes you get the entire hero sales academy plus the VMA program someone said I hate doing videos dog well if you don't like doing videos then you know you can't really do that someone actually did too many questions pouring and there's a lot of people gumming in so I'm gonna teach one more tactic about YouTube okay all right so if someone said I bought it already I'll buy it again for this put in the dollar put in a dollar okay and guys again I just go nuts in here again the person I'd the person I see going nuts the motions chat is gonna get a CH come 2020 okay so all right so I'm gonna teach you one more tactic before I hop off again the URL is directly below this video so this is pretty crazy so if you go on Facebook guys the hardest challenge most people have is when they go and run their first ads they only target interest that's really hard because I want to tell you something about your ads I'm gonna let's say you're selling a workout set all right you saw barbells and you're gonna go and target people that like bodybuilding but I'm gonna tell you right away that targeting someone just because they like bodybuilding doesn't necessarily mean they're your perfect customer for barbells you don't and so what Facebook gives you the option to do is create look-alike audiences and so what Facebook will do is if you give them enough examples of people they'll go out there and find a million people just like those people that right there is a far better audience because the perfect person for your dumbbells is probably a male 25 to 34 takes protein supplements lives in New Jersey close to the beach okay because he's a Guido that's gonna be your target marker and so what's gonna happen let's imagine we go and put up a YouTube video so we put up a video and then we run an ad to every single person to view that video so here's workout Wally okay we run an ad on YouTube to this guy alright so Bam Bam now what's gonna happen is when this is gonna look so ugly when work out Wally comes to your website he's gonna get recorded Facebook's gonna go ah workout Wally this man is 25 to 34 eats a lot of Cheetos and has an addiction to protein powder and pre-workout supplements ah I know the perfect customer for this guy and so you said about 50 to 100 of these guys to your site and then when Facebook is gonna let you do is create a look-alike audience of a million people just like this guy and here's the shortcut instead of starting off your Shopify ads or your even your digital marketing ads to people that are not your target customer you have facebook a little ego and create an audience just for you of people that are just like the people that are visiting your website organically for the most part because they are people that are watching your videos organically a guided system and watches a ten minute video on pre-workout supplements it's probably gonna be interested in pre-workout supplements don't you think and so when you're in an ad to them and SCIM to your site and you get a hundred people that are interested in pre-workout supplements to your site face it's gonna go ah I see this is the key and then it's gonna go and give you that perfect look-alike audience give me next up that's pretty cool I'm gonna give away the copy of H com 2022 Chris oh my gosh what it what a what a at the comments oh yeah look at those X's yeah all right yeah it gets me going guys all right so look guys that is tonight's livestream we're having another one tomorrow 8:00 p.m. Eastern problem you might stream in the middle of day actually I'm probably on doing like random live streams all the time at random times just like that so look guys I'm begging you right now I'm begging you come check out I'm gonna show you this real quick come get the video marketing accelerator it's gonna show you step by step everything I've done tonight down to an insane detail exactly how I'm generating like guys again the numbers don't lie it's gonna show you exactly I'm not how I'm doing all right so if we look at this right here where's the there we go so it's gonna show you exactly how I'm hopping over here you're actually gonna see some of the ad campaigns I'm running to and how we're spending eleven thousand dollars a day doing about forty thousand dollars back to the rest of this is in PayPal and more importantly show me how we had generated an extra ten kid and I really want you to see the final potential here guys remember what we talked about if you go and run a survival video you get 30,000 views here out the month if you can get just a hundred people or 200 people to try a free trial and convert at 50% and pay you 47 bucks a month you're making forty seven hundred bucks a month that's the potential here if you get a video that has a lot of views you get people to that video you get just a super small minority a hundred people out of 30,000 on a forty seven dollar per month program you are now financially free congratulations imagine this you go and create a video teaching people how to do Facebook ads you get three thousand people to view that video you run an ad right after that video that you just you get all these people for free these people now trust you they like you and they respect you you get two of those people at a three thousand to converted a thousand dollars per month pay traffic management after they already like you boom that's 24 K a year you make five or six of those videos you get five or six clients boom you're financially free you make a survival video okay you get 10k views this is why I'm really a big fan of reoccurring stuff because reoccurring stuff makes the most money just keep that in mind but let's imagine we get 10,000 views and you make the video showcasing the tent a little bit you get just 20 of those people to buy of $200 tent you just made 4000 bucks for the month and these people are gonna convert so much cheaper the clicks are gonna be so much cheaper because they know you and they're gonna convert so much higher and guys if you want to learn how to do

TITLE: How To 3x Shopify Sales With A Few Clicks
VIDEO ID: pVwAuBSGIW4

================================================================================

hashtag urination what's going on this is alex becker again and you open email number two in the v email challenge if you open three more you can get that six hundred dollar course but look we're not here to talk about the course we're here to talk about how you explode your Shopify store so what I'm gonna show you in this video is attack that I've seen so many companies use in fact I'm gonna show you a company that 100 million their first year in e-commerce and if you do any type of drop shipping any type of e-commerce whatsoever what I'm gonna show you right here makes it insanely easy to get a 5 to 10 X return on your Facebook Ads your YouTube ads and if you're using free traffic it's just insane the amount of numbers you can do and the way you do this is by focusing on the one thing that most ecommerce stores forget their back-end I'm just gonna put out a very simple scenario for you right now let's imagine you have a $10 t-shirt and so in order for you to make money on that t-shirt you need to get a person to buy for at least $5 that could be pretty difficult with your Facebook ads but what if you had a way to consistently get a person that bought that $10 t-shirt to come back a month from now and buy a $20 t-shirt and then come back two months from now and buy a $30 gadget and then come back three months from now and buy another $15 t-shirt that $10 sale would actually be worth close to forty to fifty dollars in extra business so how would that change your advertising instead of having to go out there and pay $5 to get a $10 so you could spend $12 and get that $10 sale because you know over the next three months you're gonna make 40 to 50 more dollars back that's insane that completely changes how you run ads because suddenly you're not working with these small little budgets where you can't scale cuz it's difficult something you can go out there and actually spend some real money and you're making that 5x return that allows your store to blow up because you can get really aggressive with your paid ads it's it's hard it's hard when you're working with really tight numbers like a ten dollar sale you have to get it for five bucks that's difficult going out there and getting a 10 dollar sale for $10 and in getting the extra $40 in sales coming in aka literally for Xing your money is fairly simple to do if you just follow the tactics on it and this is how so many stores to sell every big really smart brand online operates proactive the brand I'm going to show you and tons and tons of supplement companies I've researched this is exactly how they operate in fact they lose money on the front of their ads don't worry we're not gonna be doing that here but if you apply this right here it makes your ads 5 times more problem if you just tack this on what you're already doing you will make 5x the prof because these methods right here are not hard to apply it is simply getting people to come back to your store and buy more and that's the cheapest traffic source on earth because you control that traffic source via your emails so we're gonna hop in my computer right now and I'm gonna show you this works alright so where my computer and I can't stress this enough I've done massive amounts of research on companies like vouchers did one hundred million dollars their first year in fact it's Spectre my nootropic and supplement an anti-aging company we literally follow most of very similar funnels to it I'm gonna show you exactly where we make most of our money at and I've listened extensively deliver Firestone and I'm not gonna tell you exactly what he's doing I'm not going to speak for him anything of that but this is one of the brands I one of the brand's he runs boom and I literally by speaking to a ton of people in his mastermind stuff like that the biggest e-commerce businesses they make so much more of their money from retargeting and repeat customers and not that first sale and where I see so many e-commerce people messing up is this is what their business looks like they run an ad to their product and this is it like this is where the money is made and this is so this is so bad this is so incredibly bad and if you listen to what I'm gonna say in this video you will three to five extra store it is virtually impossible for you not to and it's a few clicks away so just please give me a little bit of attention right here bear with me because we're every other business is making their money is this is where most noobs and stupid businesses make their money or most other businesses make their money is back here after the sale because everything that is sold right here is free or much much cheaper than selling this first sale in fact the most expensive cost least cost efficient way to get customers it's focusing on making money on the first sale this will always have the lowest Ori by far and the stuff in the back end whether you're doing retargeting or email marketing or facebook messenger marketing I'm going to show you will always always always have the most profitable return by far always in all ways and so I'm going to show you three very simple ways in this video to explode your business actually four if we get into a bonus once so this one right here is single handily the biggest L T V if you pay attention just this one thing at more than anything else in this video your business will double it is impossible for you not to because the way you will run your business will change forever so I want to breakdown to you who's gonna make more money right here so this is how most people work let's imagine you both are selling a $10 t-shirt so you run an ad and you sell $10 t-shirt in order to get the profit from this let's imagine there's no hard cost of selling the shirt anything like that in order to make a profit right here you need to get a sale or a good prop you need to get that sale for like at least five to six bucks now that's pretty tight what does this mean if this if this is where your business stops at you have to be play a pretty tiptoe II game with your Facebook Ads you can't get aggressive like you need to only go and focus on traffic it's gonna get you this five to six star sale and what's gonna happen is eventually this is gonna become almost impossible to do as e-commerce becomes more competitive but you're having a bid very low and you're having to be very not aggressive because your business stops right here now who's gonna make more money right here this is how most multi seven-figure are eight figure or nine figure e-commerce businesses work there's an ad and let's imagine they're selling that ten dollar t-shirt but what they'll do is they'll spend $12 to get that 10 dollar sale now first off let's just focus on this right here who's gonna get most of the traffic who's gonna be able to scale their traffic further you are this person this person is they can pay $12 per sale but see you're making about probably four dollars profit right here there's no hard cost in shirts even lower when we bring an e-commerce hard cost which I'm not gonna deal with in this video because it just it brings a whole nother realm of math problems to this now let's imagine this guy right here they go and for every sale right here they are able to go and on average get a person to come back two weeks later and buy another $10 shirt and on average they're able to get a person to come in 30 days later and buy a $15.00 hat and then within three months on average people come in and buy at least one more mug or something like that for let's say 10 bucks each $10 sale right here where they've lost $2 but in the back end they just made 10 25 $35 so this ad right here even though they are losing money they are making almost six times more than you seven times more than you in their back end because the long-term value of each customer that comes in is their $35 do you do this I really don't think so most beginning Shopify businesses don't do this at all whereas literally inside a market here oh let me show you this all right so this is this is my autoresponder this is my email platform but more important this is the only system on planet earth they can do what I'm about to show you and get you this number with ease because the second you plug your Shopify store into market hero it is 100% automated when I'm over the shoes 110 I may not look I'm not gonna do any crazy pitch or anything like this the cold simple fact is market here is the only software platform that connects to your email and Facebook messenger and allows you to get these numbers there's nothing else on planet earth that does this in an automated fashion you have to combine like three other systems Infusionsoft a ton of other confusing stuff to get these numbers so check this out because I can't make it any more clear than this so here's this one product I sold called source machine from one of my businesses so let's imagine this is your e-commerce product now this product right here is $99 when a person buys it so you would think if I was running ads I'd have to clear at least I'd have to get the sale for less than $99 to make money absolutely wrong absolutely wrong and what we want to do with our ads is we want to scale them as far as possible so we want to be able to spend as much as possible and make money the more you can afford the span ads the faster your business grows so I got these people right here that bought this product let's see how much money they're worth to me over six months and wherever this is a $99 sale they're worth $180 to me okay you can see literally the extra money they bring in boom bam within ten weeks they're worth eighty three extra dollars to me within week 20 they're worth 121 dollars to me they're worth a hundred eighty extra dollars to me after the initial sale what what does that mean what does that mean for the entire business okay these are the people that come in on average of a person buys this they spend this much money with me how does this change my business if I know I'm gonna make a hundred eighty extra dollars over six months from I can spend a hundred and fifty dollars getting a ninety nine dollar sale getting that person my business because I know they're gonna come and spend a hundred eighty dollars how does that change your e-commerce business it changes everything it changes everything and really going in and I'm going to show you how simple this integration is here in a second integrating this and pulling all your data from your store literally in a second I can click the store and what it will do is pull all my sales and I'm going to show you this it will pull all my sales pull the entire data from my store and then show me the LTV of all my products what you're probably gonna see is a lot of procs that you have are actually making you way more money and you think you're going to see that you've sold a mug but those people that buy a mug on average are buying this this and this and you can build funnels around that which ties into our next our next system that's going on right here so you need to be able to go and automate sales based on your customers behaviors which is extremely easy now look market hero does abandon carts it actually bought plugs in the facebook Messenger there's so many other things I want to show you the things that are so different that we do is look you can go and tag someone based on what they buy so let's imagine they go and they bought this product alright so that the dollar sign is what happens when they get tagged with a product purchase this happens automatically in Shopify for you these products these tags are automatically generated so what I can do is as soon as this purchase is done I can go and send them an email offering them something else okay I can say okay cool they purchase this product what I want to do is I want to send this email to sending them something else and so what I can do is I can then go and then sort by tag okay so I'm gonna set it to wait three days and if they don't buy this product within three days what it's gonna do is it's gonna sell them another product okay so let's imagine they just bought let's say I have a Star Wars merch store alright so they just bought a shirt that says Luke Skywalker is the best so I can have an email automatically fire that sends them a Luke Skywalker painting or poster or hoodie or something like that now if they don't buy this let's imagine oh maybe they're sick of Luke Skywalker stuff what we want to do is we're gonna send them a Darth Vader mug right here so if they don't buy they're gonna go down the nose sequence so we're gonna do is we're to summon Darth Vader hoodie instead if they buy in another Luke Skywalker think man this person must really love Luke Skywalker what we can do is we can send him another email right here going and sending them another Luke Skywalker product okay and we can just we can literally just keep doing this over and over again so if they buy the hoodie I could have something like hey complete the collection get this thing and then what happens is if they don't buy this thing let's imagine they don't buy that I can go and sort them by their what they purchase so let's say source hunter right here is what they didn't purchase so what we can do as let's imagine they've gone through we just sold them another Luke Skywalker sure after they bought the first leg Skywalker shirt then we said okay complete the collection get the hoodie now if they buy the hoodie and we're all to Luke Skywalker stuff guess what we want to do now get them down to Darth Vader funnel say all right look you got all the Luke Skywalker stuff you could possibly get get the Darth Vader funnel now also right here if they don't complete the Luke Skywalker collection we can send another email saying hey what type what's your favorite character who do you want to see next and so then what we could do easily right here is we could go all right cool so this person go and they click Anakin Skywalker link all right so they don't like Luke Skywalker they want Anakin Skywalker so then what we can do is we can send them to an Innokin Skywalker t-shirt all right so cool they clicked it yes or let's imagine we said do you prefer Anakin Skywalker Darth Vader they say all right no I prefer Darth Vader boom we sent to the Darth Vader funnel we can literally do the same exact thing right here how much more money will we make from our single shirt sale insane amounts literally insane amounts it's bonkers how much more money won't make well how much money art so let's say right here this is initial Luke Skywalker t-shirt was 15 dollars they come through right here another 15 dollars to come through right here it's a hoodie now $25 then they go right here and they go when they select their favorite character then they get their favorite character an email select sent straight to them boom another $10 that one $15 sale just turned into like another $50 in sales that is 5x seeing the business and what we can then do is we can come in and say all right cool what are we gonna do look how can we go and actually see how much money these leads are making us now and so we can go in and say all right cool so since we put these improvements in let's see exactly actually dude in six months right here and I can go alright cool so this is exactly who I contract improvements so after 12 weeks on average the people that came in and bought the shirt are actually worth fifteen dollars to me now not just the five dollars that we originally did that changes everything now there's so many more other things we can do here we can automate based on tags there's the banning cart emails and stuff event I'll show you how easy it is to connect here in a second but the last thing I want to show you so finally here's the last thing you do the third lesson that you can use to literally triple your store insulin and I'll show you exactly how to connect all of this is so simple so look right here you can see there's a checkout this is just a demo checkout page right here and you can see this little send the messenger button and if you actually talk a face we can get it auto approved are you doing this on your store and if you are how are you automating it because I want to show you something very cool see look here's one literally from my merch store saying look when someone comes to checkout a hoodie it boom it sends them this message directly in facebook Messenger you see that you see how that works but here's the even cooler thing I can automate this based on what they do okay so check this out so someone I get the typical abandoned cart message what I can do is easily automate the Facebook automations as well just like I've showed you before so I'm going to set my Facebook page right here so what I can do is I can come down right here and I can do sort by tag and so what's gonna happen is if they haven't bought yet it's gonna let me know if they have bought yet it's gonna let me know if they haven't bought yet I'm gonna some a Facebook message right here I'm easily gonna drag this down and this is just gonna say hey are you sure this is expiring right now and if they do buy it what I can easily do is send them a message for another product right here so boom I can go and just double my sales and do a my abandoned carts via market hero via our Shopify integration via facebook Messenger that's so easy and by the way if there's another app on the market that does this it's $99 a month which is really expensive just to get your abandoned cards it doesn't do any of this and we can't even go on broadcast to them so I can literally go out here to my broadcast and I can send a facebook messenger broadcast all these people now warning you don't want to do this over 24 hours you want to send maybe to like a video or something instead teaching them something and selling it the end of the video that's the only thing Facebook will allow but just like that pal I can go and add that and then finally what I want to show you is just how simple this is to integrate again I kind of apologize cuz look this probably seems like a big old infomercial on market here but these three things I just showed you will triple your business if you go and calculate your LTV and run your ads based on that if you go and add upsells and down sells and automated funnels based on your customers behavior you will make more money and if you go and do your abandoned carts via facebook Messenger using our simple integration and then automate that based on what they do and send the broadcast you're going to increase your money more if each of those increases your business by 30% only which LTV alone could triple it you've gone and doubled your business which is the goal of this video and going and adding your store to market here oh it takes a literal seconds and you will have all the data I just talked about at your fingertips in seconds so look I'm gonna go right here I'm gonna grab my Shopify store so I'm gonna go copy and paste my store in there pal I'm not login alright cool so you can see my store has been configured is plugged in and so it's as simple as this so we're gonna turn on automatic tagging this is going to import all the customers in the market here oh great alright so all of them are been order to import it in so it's gonna automatically go and tag customers when they purchase it's gonna go in and sign them a tag when they purchase based on the product name so all that's done for us now it's also going to assign a value to them so we can track the LTV of the customer instantly now what I'm do is going to enable category integration then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit category synchronization so this is gonna sort things by category so I can do shirts mugs whatever and import all of our previous prog so this will take in my entire sales history so I can start looking at my customers right away now I'm gonna set this tag so I can easily see everybody that's come to my store so I'm just gonna do in this example right here let's just do a hero merch okay I'm gonna set that text anybody that comes through the store is gonna be tagged by that so I can easily look at my emails and everything like that I can select the template that I want sent to them for abandoned carts so I'm just guard here hit templates let's just use this one right here just a random email for right now hit next step and then boom import my previous customers pal import previous orders pal and done see how simple that was so then I can come over here to leads and I can easily see everybody that's buying for my store and I can see all right how much these people worth to me I'm gonna go right here and I'm hit generate LTV cool so on average these people were $23 to me a lifetime value so if I'm going out there and I'm getting a $10 sale and a $10 t-shirt boom I'm still making money right there and I can go right here over to finance I can look at the total sales in the entire store I'd look at the total sales that we got going on let's just do I don't know last year and boom I can see the exact sales so we can actually look at the sales that were going on right here from this one little mini storm we don't really do too much with the store so you can see the sales now I can also go over here and I can generate the LTV how much of these people worth to me long term so look at this right here I can see pal these people come back and actually send an extra 50 on average we'll come back and spend on average an extra 20 something extra bucks with me look this this is the one-month LTV right there I can get all this data within seconds of connecting to my store so sorry if this seemed like an infomercial for market here but there's literally there's no other way to do what I just showed you which is why below this video there's a link to a free trial and look since you've watched this I'm gonna give you a full-fledged Shopify course as well that we charge 997 for plus an

what the heck is the hashtag here nation why is this guy screaming at me and why the heck is he congratulating me nothing great has happened yet let me let me sum up all this real quick for you but look first things first you're gonna exactly what's in the headline of this video it's gonna be massive content massive value I'm not going to be trying to sell you anything super hard in this video and just for your benefit I want to tell you what's going on right here so you're like what what the heck is happening whenever you get an email from us and also show you a way to get a course that people pay $600 for for free it's a huge ad traffic course actually just Giants like 20 hours of content so listen up why am i sending you this video why am i sending you these free teaching videos right now and the reason for that is this my name is alex becker on the CEO of market hero and my goal here is whenever you see my name or whenever you see market here you associate with massive value and getting helped up front with nothing asked in return and my logic there is i'm gonna send you a ton of red-hot content a ton of value helps you grow your business or start your business and my theory is that after we help you out eight ton a metric ton get you some more sales more customers help your business exponentially grow you can be like well maybe i'm gonna go try out their software maybe we're gonna try out some other courses that's my logic here so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna ethically bribe you to take all the content and we're gonna be sending you the next week or two so what's gonna happen is when we send you about four more emails after the one you just received if you open all those emails inside of our system it's gonna track that it's gonna automatically deliver to you a course that people pay $600 for routinely and it's gonna send straight to you as a way of thanking you for taking in all the content and value that's already gonna help you out and though this isn't some launch funnel this isn't some launch chain I just want to get you involved with the hashtag hero nation deliver you some massive content blow you away with value so that you want to become a bigger part of our community that's literally it so to kick this up on top of giving you all the value in this video I also want to give you a course that people paid $197 for 100% for free below this video is a link to our Facebook group and in the description area of the Facebook group there's a link to $197 course called alex becker cutting that teaches insane amounts of sales tactics and facebook ad training that you can use in combination with what you're gonna see this video to actually get people to buy from you shows you step-by-step exactly what the same sales videos there's maybe tens of millions dollars online and to overcharge this with value what I'm gonna showing this video is step by step how I built my first multi-million dollar business I'm gonna show you step by step the funnels I use the exact emails I sent even the pages and ads that I used in that now even cooler if you're beginner what you're gonna see in this is how to take this and turn it into a $60,000 per your business in about 45 days if you already have a business this is gonna show you the five exit because what I'm gonna show you here literally 10x my business because it allowed me to buy unlimited amounts of paid traffic and what I was able to see is that every single lead that we got for about five dollars was worth about twenty eight dollars to us so we were able to go out there and you spend thousand two thousand bucks a day and make eight thousand to ten thousand back using the email tactics and I'm gonna show you inside of this and so if I overhyped this enough okay good good that was Mike that was my goal so what do you need to do right now be sure to go below and grab that free course in the facebook group after you watch this video ordering it it will open in a new tab so you won't lose this video and we're gonna get started right now alright guys so we're in my computer and listen up because this video is really good for three things first off is exactly how I've built three multi-million dollar businesses back to back to back now on top that if you're beginner you're starting off this is by far the easiest way to get start with a hundred percent free traffic and then build a $60,000 per year business by far the easiest okay you don't need invest anything and you can really use this with YouTube comments now finally if you're a veteran right here or you're a person wants to scale your business get to 100k to hundred K 500k a year this is exactly how you do it because it allows you to go out there and buy paid advertising in triple or six extra money like I'm gonna showing this video every single time it is lowly like you have a Bitcoin or investment where every single time you put five dollars in 30 dollars comes back out over six months and that's huge be and that's huge because that means you can start spending a ton of money on paid advertising in 5 X 6 X your money every single time with mathematical factual data like I will literally showing this video how I go out there and buy a lead for five dollars and know exactly over six moments it's gonna make me thirty dollars back it's very easy to become a millionaire doing that because all you do is buy more traffic but I'm gonna start from the very beginning and show you exactly how I built my first multi-million dollar businesses and then show you exactly how I connected this to ads with data that showed me that I cannot lose money on my ads so let's start this off so we're gonna be case studying my business source wave in this video and I got this business in it speak to a little bit over four million dollars a year getting close to five now that business right now mostly focuses on back private SEO outsourcing right now so you probably don't see it as much you probably see my main businesses market hero inspector way more and the way I've grown both of these businesses to multi-million dollar levels or specters on its way to doing so we launched it as I'm shooting this video about two weeks ago so we're already a little bit over six figures in sales but I'm doing the exact same thing you're gonna seen this video but this is how I took source way to that level so when I originally launched this business what I did is I was only using free traffic in fact for the first almost four years of my business three to four years I didn't buy any traffic and when I did it was too expensive because I would come down and buy paid traffic from Facebook ads and I noticed it was about five dollars per lead that's just like super expensive like if I went out and bought two hundred leads a day that's a thousand bucks a day that was insane to me because it's just like what am I getting for this five dollars and really gonna see out here this was the most profitable five dollars I could ever spend but I didn't know that yet because of this so what I would do is I'd mostly use forums to generate traffic I'd go in comment on people's posts I'd launch products and forums I'd launch services on forums and I start getting people's emails or I'd send them to an opt-in page that offered them something in return for their email so let me show you what this page looks like so you understand this entire process so if you look at this page right here obviously we're trying to attract SEO is because we're selling SEO software SEO services and SEO training so what the bait pages is basically offer them something in exchange for their email address in short we give them something in order to gain permission to email them marketing materials to gather their email address so what we're doing here is extremely ethical we don't want to be gathering people's emails that don't want to get emails from us in fact we want to really help these people out and so then what happens after they opt-in is they go and they get to a thank you video okay and so what would happen then let me pull up this one and this is a thank you being I'm and explain why I do this in a second but this video itself actually makes me a ton of money too I'll explain it here in a second though but what this is is I like to call this the 8x RTR funnel the reason why I call it RTR is this look if you've ever bought anything from anybody I can almost guarantee they had these three things they had your respect okay meaning that if you're watching this video right now and you believe that I'm an authority believe I know what I'm talking about you respect the information and words that are coming out of my mouth therefore you're going to trust them as well and what trust means is if I tell you something you're gonna believe it if you trust me to actually have your best interest you're gonna believe what's coming out of my mouth and then finally rapport is liking the business or the person you're speaking with okay look if you walk into anything if let's say I'm you're interested in anti-aging and you respect my knowledge you trust what I'm saying and trust that I have your best interest and you like me you're going to buy the product I'm selling with minimal selling now if you do not respect me you don't really like me and you don't trust me it is going to be nearly impossible for me to get you to buy anything okay I'm gonna have to be the world's greatest salesperson to get you to buy something but if you can achieve these things you can be borderline bad at selling and get people to buy a ton of stuff so what happens is the person would go through they get they'd offer this bait so I'd offer them a reward for their email address if they go to a thank-you page and on this thank-you page what I do is say hey my name is Alex Becker I'm the owner of source wave anytime you see my brand I want you to know that we have your back we're gonna help you first and actually what I'm doing over the next few days is I'm gonna send you a bunch of emails that are gonna teach you how to do your SEO better and we're gonna train you for free because we want you to know that source who has your back so whenever you see an email from us be sure to open it because you know it's pure training and value from us and the reason why we're doing this is our motto is if we help you a ton first eventually you're gonna want to come back and try our software in Prague so don't worry about a thing right now let's get the training and so then what would happen is I would go and they'd go to this training video where I train them on SEO for about 15 minutes and then at the end of the video what you see right here there's an offer for source university where they can get like a free trial or something like that so essentially what I do is I help people at a ton and then I just make a very subtle pitch for a product to learn more you see how easy it is I'm not even really selling that hard so then what would happen is every two days my emails would follow this exact pattern this is exactly how I would make money I'd send a person value emails which are represented by this V so this email right here teaches them something cool and at the end of each of these videos that actually still pitch our products source University or one of our software's or an affiliate products okay an affiliate product is a product where we get a 50% Commission if the person were if the person we send buys that so I'd send an email that helped them out I'd send an email that helped them out and then I send on the third email an email that pitches them something not hard but just like hey look I helped you on this subject in this subject so let's imagine right now we're talking about building links so this video right here is about building SEO links don't worry about what SEO links are just take the general purpose this video is about building SEO links and by the way here's a tool that builds SEO links and then I do the same exact thing to more value videos so let's imagine this one is about keyword research so this video teaches them how to find keywords this video teaches method by keywords while steadily pitching a keyword tool and in this final email right here pitches the keyword tool you see how that works so let's imagine these two emails right here teach them how to build links and in this product right here teaches them how to build links so that's exactly the pattern it would follow and here's the crazy thing this pattern goes on for about three months in the funnel and then there's normal emails and stuff that I'm sitting out on get to but what I realized is this here's the here's exactly how I became a multi multi-millionaire is that when people came through this funnel on average over about six months they were worth about twenty four dollars to me this means over six months let's imagine if I got a thousand people in through this email right here on average those thousand people would make me twenty four thousand dollars on average those people those thousand people would spend twenty four dollars with me a pop so if I made twenty four thousand dollars from a thousand people I'm making about twenty four dollars for email and I saw that I mathematically track that and what most people do and the reason why they can't run ads is they see this right here alright they see oh man I'm paying five dollars for lead but they don't track what's going on there so it just looks like a big negative loss but in reality what's going on is if you track everything that your customers are doing your emails are doing when you kill the people's emails you're gonna see oh my I'm making a lot of money so what I eventually did is I put a tracking system in place and it was a giant pain it's extremely difficult to do back to day I did I combined this system of Infusionsoft with improve Lee and all sorts of those stuff and still my numbers were not anywhere near accurate but it was it was around twenty four dollars I knew that from twenty to thirty bucks that works because what I then realized is in when I turn on facebook ads right here I could get SCO leads for about five bucks that's like the top I'd have to pay for it I keep going usually getting for about three to four but five bucks was the upper limit right there so what does that mean if I bring in an SCO leave from Facebook for $5.00 I make $25 back $24 so let's just round it up and say I'm 5 X seeing the 6x seeing my money sometimes I'd even get leads for three dollars so I'm a texting my money so that's why we call this the 8x email funnel back in a day so how did I become a multi-millionaire knowing that I'm 5x seeing my money all right I'm 5x saying every single dollar I put into this it's very simple if I want to go and make three thousand three thousand five hundred dollars a day all I need to do is spend about 650 dollars a day on ads because that's gonna get me enough leads and I'm 5x seeing my money because I notice I have mathematically proven this now this is extremely difficult to do in the past it's not anymore and let me show you exactly let me show you this literally in action right here so first up how do we actually go and build this funnel of emails and everything that gets sent out I'm gonna show you everything in detail here in a second so the way we do this is we can use market here oh and look I'm gonna spew straight with you I'm not gonna hard pitch you market here obviously you were on the market here a website right now you're getting training from market here oh but my goal right here is to help you out a ton okay I don't care if you buy our software right now or anything like that the reason why I'm showing you this in here is because there's literally no other system on earth that does this I literally had market Hero designed because there was no other system on planner if they can do this but let me show you this this welcome stream right here okay so this is an example of what it looks like and so you can see this one right here you can see exactly what I'm talking about right here so I can go in here's the optin alright so remember that opt-in I showed you we go right here we can go pick a template we can have a person opt-in right there and then we go and send their first welcome email okay boom here's an email welcoming you to the business and everything like that and we can go through and we can have it send emails every two days you say boom here's the first email here's the second email here's a pitch okay alright so here's another email than a pitch another email value email value email another value email than a pitch you can see this exact patterns actually built out in this funnel for me so that's all handled right there and the cool thing about this is this actually tracks the value but remember when I talked about how do we take this to pay traffic it's very simple so inside of market hero we can go and create products okay we can set a value to the product name we just put this on the Thank You page or actually if you're using Shopify or any other cart system this is automatically done for you so literally everything I talked about before is automatically done for you and here's where it gets really nasty so if I go right here and I go down to our finance board right here I can see this exact number like literally think about this if you knew for every five dollars you were spending you were making twenty four dollars back would you feel comfortable scaling your ads to a thousand two thousand dollars a day yes because you were literally it is little like investing in a stock that gets you a 6x ROI every single time but the thing is it's really hard to get this data in the past is you have to combine like ten different things so check this out then this date is a little bit off it's not gonna show the $24 LTV because I didn't have everything tracked and sorts away when I was doing this but it's gonna show you got a very good example of what I'm talking about here so I'm gonna go to LTV mode right here and I'm gonna set my data for nine months and see exactly how much every single lead that came in through source waved through this funnel is worth to me okay so check this out so in the first month they're worth about seven dollars to me so that means if I spending if I was spending five dollars per lead I'm making money in the first month now the second month they're worth ten dollars to me I've doubled my money by the second month that's a pretty good stock in my book third month eleven dollars fourth month fourteen dollars fifteen months seven fifteen and so even in this one where not everything is tracked I'm tripling my money on the leads that are coming into my business you see how that works and I can actually see the exact products they're buying exactly the BRIT makeup of what they're buying so then I can go back over to this funnel that I showed you and then optimize that I can say okay cool looks like people are really like this product and not this product so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in in my second pitch email what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna sell this product differently I'm gonna sell a different product right here alright and so that's how that's gonna work and so that's exactly how it's done now let me kind of break down exactly how we go and get this traffic Ari this is a full-fledged training and the one thing I want to throw in is like look this video is probably gonna be about fifteen to twenty minutes if you hop in below there's actually a $49 per month free trial market hero if you go through our site it's $99 per month period okay this is like a special like one-time link right below did you only get because you attended one of our webinars and so what you're gonna get when you sign up as well as we're going to throw in the 8x Academy and this actually breaks down everything I'm doing in like insane detail now we charge 997 for this course if you hop in through the link below which is a special free trial link it's gonna activate this course in your account and give this to you automatically so it's gonna show you all the advertising stuff I'm doing all the YouTube ads exactly how I'm getting traffic action it's gonna show you step by step by step it actually it's gonna show you step by step by step how to get all the free traffic from the most relevant sources right now like forums YouTube and everything so you can get this all for free below but I want to keep teaching you I want you get massive valuing this video and I don't want a hard pitch anything to you so let's talk about exactly first up how to get traffic and how to make money if you already have a business you have a product that you can sell and you already know what you're gonna sell but if you don't have a product don't worry about that I'll show you what to sell here in a second I want to show you to get free traffic from these three traffic sources and our goal right here is to if you're beginner get a hundred people paying you 50 bucks a month I'm gonna show you exactly how we do that I'm going to show you to do that in about two months time only using free traffic okay so for the rest of this video if you're ever your business I assume you know what you're gonna sell I want to talk about a person who doesn't have a product when I really suggest you sell is a membership okay and what's really cool is on Facebook right now you could actually go and make paid membership groups so people can literally pay you via Facebook to be in your face of group and so what you want to sell let's imagine your niche is weight loss you're teaching people how they get a six-pack or something doesn't matter what it is just find something you can teach people how to do you can have a membership well people pay you $50 a month for your time okay and the reason why you want to sell your time is that's the most valuable thing you can sell so you can really guarantee someone's gonna pay 50 bucks a month that for example if you want to sit down with me for an hour lesson on a call it's gonna cost you probably five to ten thousand dollars because I hate doing that stuff however you can also get access to information and I'm selling via videos for forty seven dollars obviously your personal time is worth far more so most work out like let's say you're doing personal training or something most workout personal trainers are going to charge like two hundred dollars for a free consultation a Schnoor a private coaching or something like that you'd be the discount version online you see how it works this is not something that's scalable or something you want to scale to a million dollars a month or something like that nothing like that but this is something you need to build your first business now what we're gonna do is you're gonna see in this this series right here we're gonna follow that same exact process you're gonna have a bait that gives people bait to opt in something that helps them they're interested in we're gonna give them so Thank You VIN we're just gonna do this value value pitch value value pitch and the only thing we're gonna sell is this $50 per month membership that's it and what I would suggest doing is inside the Facebook group you can upload a ton of videos and training you can allow the people to PM you and you can allow the people to tag in the group and you answer questions and stuff like that basically you're just like a help coach it takes nothing to start it's 100% free to do and if you don't have any skill sets that people want to learn partner with someone you do the marketing they do the teaching and training very easy give them maybe twenty thirty percent of business and you just go from there so that's what we're gonna sell again if you just go down and click this button right here inside of market hero and again this is one hundred you can access us all for free now it breaks down how to create the product and everything like and again I'm gonna give you as much value as I can in this video it's just this video is getting close to 15 minutes now as I check it so it's gonna be hard for me to teach too much more in this video so you can literally go and see exactly what products that pick what to promote everything like that again for free below via the free trial for market here that allows you to do all the marketing stuff we're about to talk about so what we want to do is we want to go and get a hundred people on this ok so I want to I want to do some basic math if we can go and get a hundred people to opt-in think in your head right now is it reasonable that we could get five of these people onto your fifty dollar month coaching yeah that's very reasonable that's pretty damn low okay that's pretty dang low so if we need a thousand people a month to say yes this bait we can get fifty people a month to say yes to our our coaching program right here okay maybe even if it's thirty that's still fine it's still fine because what you're doing is you're selling something is just to steal the century like if you're doing personal coaching or training or weight loss private training you should be charging like two hundred bucks a month but you're giving them a deal of the century right here so we need to get a thousand people opted in every single month right here when you get a thousand people and so it's actually not that hard if you split it up between these three traffic sources if we can get just ten people day from YouTube ten people day from forums and ten people day from Facebook groups it's not too hard to get a thousand people to opt in every single month that that died like that literally map that's 30 30 30 that's about 900 so you want to get about the 33 people day but just round up with me because it's more simple if we do that so let's talk about how we get traffic from all these places all right so first off here's warm right here there's forums and every single niche there's where your target customer is hanging out and talking now if you look at these groups right here I got hundreds and thousands of people to opt-in to my list literally just by doing this so check this out first off you can link to your opt-in but I wouldn't do that what I would do is you go around forums and you help people out with their prams you be super helpful that beign that builds that respect trust and rapport naturally so people gonna be more inclined to opt-in to your opt-in and then what you want to do is if you look in the the signatures of people they're gonna usually have links to their business so all you do is you help people out I wouldn't and then occasionally link to your opt-in while helping people out and then have this link to it so every time you post and help someone there's literally an advertisement for your business what I would do is I would go and post about maybe thirty times a day on forum on these forums helping people out but end of the month if you're doing 30 posts a day that's 900 advertisements in front of your target customer all over these forms it's completely reasonable to expect just 10 people day will come through an opt-in you keep helping people you build up a reputation you'll have a lot more people opt-in next you can go join facebook groups so here's someone that I use as an example all the time so this is an acid reflux groupings go so so this is an acid reflux group so let's imagine we're like a healthy eating coach or something like that go join groups that have like fifty thousand hundred thousand members and just help people in the group that that's literally it help people for about a week if you go in and start just posting links to your opt-in you're getting it banned but go in and then just start helping people in the comments section and in every maybe fifth post we leave a link to your opt-in saying hey well this this free course that right here really helped me out or this free training right here really helped me out this bait right here really helped me out what's gonna happen is you're gonna have that link in front of every single person in the group so someone asks maybe like oh man I'm having a really bad acid reflux you go well there's a really specific diet strategy you can follow I'd have to like write a book right here to explain to you here's literally a book you can get for free on how to actually reverse this and you just link it right there boom you have bunches of people if you're like maybe five of these groups you have again tens of thousands fifties of thousands hundreds of thousand people that this in front of it's very reasonable to expect about ten people day to come through once you've interacted and built enough reputation in these groups finally on YouTube go and find youtubers that are in your niche when they post a video up what's gonna happen is you're gonna see thousands of comments if it's a popular video if it's a only getting this one only has like fifty eight thousand views so it doesn't have that many comments actually because it was also posted in my site but what you want to do is when you see people going and asking questions the person who makes the video I didn't respond to any of these it's gonna be the same across anything so you go and find people in your niche answer their questions and then leave a link to your opt-in that's it just help people in the comment section what's gonna happen is the tens of thousands of people usually flood a video when it first comes up are going to see the answers they're going to read them and they're gonna go through your comment you do this on 50 videos a day which takes about thirty minutes to do literally by the end of a month you have fifteen hundred videos with your link all over it and you and as I am and you answering questions it's very reasonable to expect fifty people they are it's very reasonable to expect at least ten people a day to go through to you can actually probably get like 50 people down YouTube and that gets those thousand people day in then what you do is you just keep sending these people down your funnel what's gonna happen is if you're using market hero specifically it's gonna track exactly how much they're buying and then tell you exactly how much they're worth over three months then what you do is you go on over the Facebook can you buy people for less than that value congratulations you are now making six figures maybe even seven figures if you just scale this up that's literally all I did that's literally all I did so this is the end of the first training video two things first off remember to open our next email so if you go and open our next four emails you're going to get a six hundred

TITLE: $8,000 A Day Facebook Ad Targeting Step By Step
VIDEO ID: RvKFN2xUMow
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvKFN2xUMow
================================================================================

what is up guys this is alex becker CEO of market hero do you guys like my cool title i have to say to every at the start of every videos you know i'm a really important guy but beyond this this video is important because i'm gonna show you the key to generating five thousand eight thousand ten thousand dollars a day on facebook ads I'm gonna take you inside of the account where we spend about two to three thousand dollars a day and make about five six eight some days on a really good day ten K back and the thing I want to stress on this video and the reason why I'm making this video is when a lot of people out market here I'll have huge interest in Facebook ads and with our new Facebook sinking feature that sinks your email list up with all your retargeting lists and everything on Facebook automatically I want to talk about this little bit a bit more so I see everybody who's trying to do this they over complicate and they miss how Facebook Ads are supposed to work Facebook ads are designed to do most of the heavy lifting in the targeting for you once you give Facebook a little bit of data and so what I'm gonna show you right here is this ad account where I'm spending two to three thousand dollars a day but what you're gonna see is so shockingly different than a lot of people's ad accounts you make far less a day from Facebook than we do and I want to stress that Facebook is one of many ad platforms we use it only represents about twenty percent of our traffic that being said a lot of people are making far less than us have extremely complicated Facebook ads set ups their their keyword I'm gonna use the word keyword an interest and unchangeably because I work more most an hours but the target they do is is so all over the place so finely tuned and you really don't want to do that what you want to do is give Facebook a little bit of data and then give them a big ass net and then that's going to allow you to go out there and get tremendous results so what you're gonna see in this ad account is it's almost it's only five or six ad sets we're the very basic targeting and I'm gonna show you the target behind that and how I use that targeting to get leads at a huge discount very cheap leads and you need to understand Facebook's scaling limits and everything that i'ma break down this video but more importantly I mentally go out there and spend two three thousand dollars a day get hundreds and hundreds of leads in and make a five six eight sometimes 10k day return and that's why I may be breaking down this video that's what I'm gonna be doing and if you really like this video you should be sure to open more of our emails and you should definitely buy market hero go check out the free trial it's amazing below so let's get into this content all right boys and girls we are now inside my computer it's a very cool place there are there's free drinks there's chimpanzees juggling fire and there's even cookie so you're watching this from a video so you can't see all this so just just take my word on it so oh I know you're really excited about the cookies now I didn't mean to distract you but what we're gonna get into right now that is worth your attention because I'm gonna be showing you really the nuances of Facebook advertising and like I talked about in the intro and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna try and repeat myself too much here but a lot of Facebook advertising can be done without targeting a single key word slash interest okay and we use the word key word an interest interchangeably because you need to understand that 80 percent of my traffic comes from Adwords and other platforms Facebook is just one of many things I use but I want to show you since this is what most people get started on and the thing I want to point out first is we're inside this ad account right here and you can see this ad account easily is spending about two thousand dollars a day and I want to break down one thing not none of my interest is or and none of my groups right here the only one is really targeting keywords is this bad boy right here and this isn't even like our major one you can see I really didn't run too much going on right here and so if we actually go and like look at this campaign sir this one right here is targeting just basic basic interest basic keywords and stuff like that but what you're gonna see in a lot of my other groups is it's literally not even just carbon copied a similar audience so if you actually go and look at this audience right here and this is where I'm really be talking about the day's similar audiences and retargeting because this is where the real magic is at because you can see what I'm doing is is this is just a look-alike audience and you can see I'm getting tons of registrations at a great Cpl right here and that's it and so what I'm gonna break down here isn't super advanced Facebook advertising because honestly this account right here a two thousand bucks a day usually makes me about six to eight thousand dollars a day back so that that's great that's great by most people's standards and I want to distress it you don't really need to be doing anything crazy to get to eight to 10 K a day earned on Facebook ads you don't have to be doing something crazy or finding some loophole you can just literally use similar audiences and stacked targeting so that's what I want to get into so before we do this though I to break down kind of a revolution and how I viewed ads and really think that makes a little difference so you're viewing this on the market your website right now so I'm assuming that you have an email list so there you have three types of audiences that I'm just gonna listen this video that you can reach and make a significant ROI on and just immediately and blow up your business all right so you have your email list which you can reach for free you have your visitors that come to your website and then you have these people via retargeting so what does this mean the two people that are going to be most likely to buy something from you and the easiest to engage with are going to be people that are on your email list or people that visit your website the end but the thing is if we want to reach people on our email list we can only do so often do it so often with emails you need to understand that that's the one downfall of emails if I send my email lists the same exact after every single day for 30 days it's gonna lead to massive disengagement the same exact thing and problem with visitors is you really only have one shot at them and you can't market to them too much and the thing is most people do not really reuse retargeting for their email lists and their visits the way they should what a lot of people do is they think oh I'm gonna run an ad or something but I want to get new customers and what you need to understand is if you start trading retargeting like an email list where you scratched out the offers you change up the offers you you hit them with something new every single week it's one of the easiest ways to blow up your business now what we can also then do to acquire new customers is we create lists of people that are very similar to our retargeting of our email and visits and then we use various types of interests tacking or just heck the audience to go out there and do that now one thing I also want to stress is the more the more registrations the more conversions that your Facebook pixel records the more powerful it gets so let's imagine you have a pixel in its day one and what you want to do is you want to start targeting people on your email list you want to start targeting your visitors immediately because what's gonna do is it's gonna build up your pixel and kind of give them a screen shot of who your perfect customer is once you have about a thousand the two thousand let's just say conversions people opting onto your email is opting into your your webinars opting into your optin this pixel is gonna be very very very useful it's gonna allow you to go out there and do that kind of stuff so what you want to do first off when we're doing face week I'm gonna break down in the ad account how they actually do these things it's first off you want to upload your email list you want to upload our place retargeting pixel on your website and you want to start running opt-in ads to those customers why do you want to do it so you can follow up with them after they opt-in and do the funnels now here's the cool thing about market here first off every single person that joins your email list is automatically added to your Facebook audiences okay so you can actually very effectively market to people that are on your email is just by syncing it with market here and we have a Facebook sink inside there if you want to go check that out there's a free trial to market here a blow among all the other things it does like tracking your LTV tracking your conversion tracking all the things that you need to actually run Facebook Ads effectively those numbers are pretty much not not up for debate you need to have your LTV and you know how it's your your emails are making you but if we sink this from market hero what's gonna do is it's gonna automatically update the email list for us and then the visits are gonna automatically be updated for us as well and so we want to start running opt-in as to these people and a really good example of a great opt-in that you can run it for is for webinars or for a free book offer or something to get some opt-in then they're sold to after that and these people are gonna be very cheap to get the up in and their conversions gonna be very high so what this allows you to do right here is just add another facet of your business where you're selling if you have an email list of 80,000 people I guarantee you're only really reaching about 40,000 people on that email list just because you know not everybody's gonna be open their emails so the way you reach that other 40,000 is you hit them up on Facebook you hit them up on Adwords so you hit the visitors on your website and more importantly what we want to do is if a person visits your website we want that email we need that email so what you need to do is you need to be hitting them up with an opt-in immediately after they visit your website so you can start building up your email list and what's gonna happen is your pixel is going to start tracking all this and it's gonna allow your pixel to become very hyperactive a very hyper targeted allow you to always you could just literally target just a big broad audience and you can still get conversions at a good rate because the pixel knows who to look for so once we have this in place guys what we want to do is we want to create three types of audiences okay we want to create these basic similar audiences we want to create similar to visit audiences all right so we want to have similar to our email list and similar to visits those are two types of audience and we want to do similar stacked audiences and this right here is more than enough depending on your business to spend up to two thousand three thousand five thousand a day depending on how large your niche is okay I work in a pretty small niche which is internet marketing which you might think is really huge but compared to something like weight loss or skincare or just general niches out there it's it's a little tiny niche so let me show you how we do that so in this video I'm not gonna get into uploading your email list that can actually be automatically synced to be a market hero I'm not gonna get into adding a retargeting pixel to your website I'm not gonna get into creating similar audiences those are all things that can be easily solved just by watching a simple tutorial video and I don't want to waste your time doing that if you need help doing that I've went to some tutorial videos below this video on the block what I want to talk about is simply making the audiences to convert because if you know this right here you're gonna do pretty well so what we want to do is you want to go and when you crane your ad focus on conversions now there's all sorts of creative cool things you can do with all these options but again I'm trying to keep this simple because again it you don't need to be worrying about complicated stuff until you're making 5,000 10,000 bucks a day off your ads that's just that's just how it is you don't need to do complicated stuff to make large amount of monies on Facebook you large modem who knows you just don't need to at least not from what I'm doing and I'm working in a very competitive niche so I'm gonna just do name this you know demo and what we're gonna do for conversions is I'm gonna set the conversion up to our complete registration pixels you can see anybody that opsin triggers his conversion and face we're kind of records who they are what they're doing and everything like that so that's fine great this is what we want the pixel to do so the pixel we already have a first layer of targeting just using this pixel right here now the next thing you want to do is you want to target our similar audiences okay so the first step of audience we want to create is just simply look-alike a to our email list that's it okay we can create an ad just doing this we create the ad we go and pump it out we start with that right away that's one audience right there that we can scale to a lot of money every single day it's over it's over 3.4 million people now one thing you wanted to uncheck is you this depends on you you either want to check or uncheck this so to expand interest this is an easy way to keep it going past the 3.4 million people you can expand it right here on Facebook go find people using your pixel on this layer you need to understand it right here this looks like very little targeting but we have one layer of targeting right here we have another layer of targeting right here and we can even close this off right here I like to keep it expanding because they will go and find new customers and stuff now the next targeting what you want to do that can't scale quite as far as you want to do a 2% look-alike of our email list and visitors okay so we want to create items for both these this is really big and really broad and so the way we double down on this is we want to go in let's say I want to target everybody that let's say i'm i'm in the marking so let's just do anybody that likes MailChimp okay so if I want to find perfect people that are good for my autoresponder anybody that also likes MailChimp so they have to follow the kind of hole in the profile the complete registration they have to look like the look-alike and they also have to like MailChimp now if you really want to narrow this down you're looking at a cheap budget you can super do it so I'm going to say anybody that likes MailChimp and Mike Dillard since he's an authority kind of on email marketing so this layers it down so I have a potential reach of 15,000 people so if I'm looking only to spend about a hundred bucks a day this is an amazing audience right here because it's hyper hyper hyper targeted now the next type of audience and so what we can then do is we're gonna make several of these types of audience so I can do everybody likes MailChimp and likes Frank Kern okay and I can I can create tons of these little audiences and put out 25 to 50 bucks a day into that so that is how you go out there and target that now one thing to understand is I usually don't even go down to that narrow targeting I'll just add a few people in here like alright so they have to look alike my audience and then they have to like like let's just type in Russell Brunson so weird it doesn't show up when we do it all right so they have to like get response Infusionsoft one of these things right here okay so that gives me a big ol list of people to go after and make a 25 $200 a day audience now the thing you want to understand Facebook Ads is the way to really scale it is once you get to a certain point what ads they're not gonna scale anymore for example this audience right here if I if I try and spend $500 a day on the sidings it doesn't scale and what that means is it's kind of like you built an engine they can only go 30 miles per hour and once you try and start making a go 5060 miles per hour it starts to break down you need to be aware of this and so when you're gonna be looking at your ads as these audiences scale and scale you know depending on the size of the people it's gonna stop and you want to create more audiences so if I get to let's just say with this audience right here if I get to $50 a day and the CPL styling is good but if I bump it up to 100 bucks a day in the Cpl goes to crap what I want to do is lower it back down to 50 bucks a day and make another audience it looks like I don't know maybe people that like names are my competitors so I'm gonna type in that's just to you know Frank Kern and we'll just do all sorts of other marketers and stuff that pop up right here so you can I can do you know Tony Robin and these triple layers are dead so I view this the way to scale is you create more audiences and more target you don't try and scale one audience to 5000 bucks a day that's just not how it works it bottoms out eventually now finally the last tip I want to give you is you want to have a retargeting pixel on your opt-in page and so what you want to do is you got to understand the goal of when you're running ads is to get people in this cheap please possum the people are gonna be able to get in and cheaply as possible people that have already clicked your ad and showed interest and so what you can do is you can also create an audience that targets people that abuse your opt-in and what you want to do is we target them with another ad saying hey look I know I saw you clicked on this I know you're interested but you didn't opt-in so let me throw in a book let me throw in a goodie let me throw on something that gets you over the edge and so you need and you target those people and so that's gonna get you another audience so every single ad you're running let's imagine you reach 20,000 people day you know 3,000 of them opted in those 17,000 other people are still interested people on the fence and that's how you can go out there and completely overhaul and this really works in any niche if you're doing e-commerce if you're doing internet marketing if you're doing any any type of direct marketing type niche out there this is how you do it and the only difference didn't switch between us if you're doing e-commerce is you're simply using the purchases or add to carts you can use add to carts or purchases to create your kind of pixel right here and there you go so I would ask you all with add the carts because then you can get a little bit bigger of an audience and get more data for to look like that's is to it another thing to do with your Shopify store upload your email lists upload your visitors if a person visits your site that means they're pretty interested you want to retarget the heck out of those people so these are some really quick tips on how to create really effective Facebook audiences they can get you the five to eight thousand ten thousand dollars a day ROI once you get to that you might need to get a little bit more creative or you might just need to do more of the same for example if I was in the skincare niche or something right now I could use these these audience that go super broad I could create audiences of three five million people and then use my pixel plus some interest retargeting to go out there and really really nail that down so you need to understand this is such a weapon and bigger niches and so this is all there is today and one thing I want to break down is market hero automatically syncs your email list to Facebook it goes and um builds these audiences for you it also tracks the ROI you're getting from every single email that comes in and so you're able to see ok cool yesterday I got 50 emails I spent two hundred fifty dollars getting those emails but I made three hundred twenty dollars back and over time I make about a thousand dollars back from those fifty

TITLE: Instantly Improve Shopify Stores Sales By 30-50% (3 Easy Steps)
VIDEO ID: KSNirY_oOS8
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSNirY_oOS8
================================================================================

[Music] hashtag urination what is going on this is Alex Becker CEO of this whole market hero thing and today I'm going to show you three simple tactics you can use to increase any Shopify store actually any online business by 30 to 50 percent now before we get going I know this whole shooting setup isn't exactly professional but our studio is not set up yet but I just wanted to kind of drop by and say hi before we hop into my computer over here and get in the content I also want to show you the new market hero phone cases they're pretty cool they increase your signal strength by like 20% - but besides that what is up guys if I'm in my computer right now and let's get into this tactic all right guys we're inside my computer and we're looking at the whiteboard of truth and justice and I'm just gonna get right to it I'm gonna show you the instantly increase your Shopify revenue and this video is gonna be very quick because what I'm gonna show you here isn't complicated then when you apply this to your store it's gonna take you probably about a minute two minutes to actually apply but this is going to overnight increase your sales by thirty to fifty percent so there's four things we can do and I've I've arranged these all out right here on how we can go out there and really kill it so here's the first thing you do and it's it's the easiest of course but this is what most Shopify sellers are doing they're they're running a Facebook ad okay and then we're gonna send this Facebook ad to our store and from the store someone's gonna pay us ten bucks okay so this looks pretty good especially if we're only paying five bucks to get that $10 sales it's a two xry this is fantastic it's actually not because most Shopify sellers are only sending one or two emails a month if that okay we've worked with a lot a lot of stores and about 85% of stores are not sending any emails and in fact there's only about probably 5% stores that are doing their email marketing correctly but this is the first thing you need to remedy this so this person comes through you have their email address you know they would like to stuff and your store they're gonna buy it so what do you do you maybe send them some content and information to make them like your store a little bit more let's imagine they come here and they buy a t-shirt that says hey I like camping we cinema maybe a video on something that teaches them about camping and then maybe the week after that we send them right back to our store to buy maybe a ten dollar flashlight or something like that just simple situation right here has increased our ROI from our ad from just five dollars to fifteen dollars now if we can go again send some more content to them and then send them to another $10 offer and I'm just really dumbing this down of course not all of our offers gonna be ten bucks but what have we done right here we've got to turn us into $25 ROI and so instead of going out there and just getting a 1 X are 100 percent ROI we've gone out there and nearly tripled quadrupled the ROI we're getting so let me show you how to do this inside of your store so I'm gonna do this with our official market hero and alex becker emerge store and show you how i'm actually going to improve sales from my Shopify store doing this so right now we're looking at my store right here we're inside the dashboard and what I've done is I've already connected this store to market here own so what I want to do first off is I want to go and make it so that anybody who checks out for my store automatically has products attached to them so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to turn on automatic sales tagging and so whenever somebody checks out it's gonna sign a tag to them in market hero so I can separate people by what they've bought and what they haven't bought and actually calculate their value to me but more importantly we just want to hit this option first and the next thing I'm going to do is hit import previous customers so what this is gonna do is it's gonna download every single customer in my store that is bought in the past now what I also want to do is I want to import previous products and then I want to import previous orders now more on why I did those other features here in a second but what I can now do is I can go into my app and here's the really cool thing you can see I've actually gone and download every single person that's bought something from my store but I can see exactly who's bought something and more importantly what I can do right now so first things first I want to see exactly what store they came from when I'm doing this so I'm just gonna tag them hero merch so I know exactly where they came from but now what I can do is I can come on over to my broadcast tab and automatically go out there and email every single person's came to my store so let's imagine every week every Monday I just send them a weekly discount or something like that doing that alone will instantly increase my sales 10 to 15 percent overnight just a simple tactic but here's where things start to get really fun so the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna go down and we're gonna do segment and mailing so we want to see who's bought what and sell them what they haven't bought so let's imagine I have two t-shirts at my hero merch store okay so I got t-shirt number one and I got t-shirt number two now obviously what I want to have happen when a person comes to and buys t-shirt number one I don't just want them to just go away forever what I want to do is I want to then sell them t-shirt number two because they're probably interested in buying something else and people that buy t-shirt number two I want to sell them t-shirt number one just doing this let's imagine we have a Facebook ad right here and someone comes and buys a product from us cost us again $10 we profit or $10 we generate in revenue and it costs us $5 to get them there so we just made 5 bucks but an easy way to make another 10 bucks is to then say hey you like this shirt maybe you want to buy this shirt and boom we just made another $10 so how we do that that is so so cool inside of this is we're gonna go over to our lead section and what you can see is I can see exactly what people have bought ok I can see exactly how much they bought of it everything they bought everything like theirs so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and take this tag and I'm gonna bring it on over to our broadcast tab I'm gonna go and select everybody that has this tag you can see boom right there there's that one guy but doesn't have let's just say this t-shirt I'm just gonna select a random one let's just do Hero iPhone ok let's say they haven't bought the iPhone case yet so they just bought the hoodie they have about the iPhone yet so I'm going to remove anybody that has this but hasn't bought this so right there what this is gonna show normally because I haven't sold enough iPhone coverage from my store yet I kind of suck at it but let's imagine right here I have 200 people that have bought this and I have 20 people that have bought this it's gonna remove those 20 and I can send them a message now saying hey you just picked up the hoodie why don't you get the phone case to go with it boom segment and targeted mailing that allows me to segment my customers and sell them what they haven't already bought so that alone right there will again increase our sales by another 10 to 15 percent just doing that because you're getting people that haven't bought something to buy something else now the easiest thing we can do again is if a person comes from our store from a Facebook ad and then they come to our cart and I'm just gonna make a really ugly cart symbol right there that says this is just gonna be our cart they come to our cart and they don't check out they just abandon the cart so they just go somewhere else so what we want to have happen so we then do is we can come back to our Shopify integration market here oh and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set it so that if they come in and don't do this so and set minutes that I want the cart abandonment to work I'm gonna so if they don't check out within 10 minutes of starting check out what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send them a specific email and so I can select a Bandhan cart draft email that I will send them and so when they go and do this an email will be symptom say hey dude you didn't quite check out you know maybe maybe you want to follow up maybe you want to come back and check this out this is the easiest easiest way for us to go and recapture these people and this is just a incident way to increase our sales by an easy 5% easy you just follow up and say hey dude you didn't check out maybe you want to finish your check out now the next thing I want to show you is very cool and then I'm gonna get into something very advanced it allows you to just dominate with advertising but the next coolest thing is up cells and down cells so what we can do right here is inside the app you can have a tag applied whenever a person starts to check out so if the tag hero merch is applied what's gonna happen when they start check out or do anything in my store the second I get their email the tag hero merch is gonna be applied now what we can do is we can go and create a upsell stream so what's gonna happen is I'm gonna create a stream right here and whenever two tag market hero is applied from Shopify what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have it removed from all streams I'm gonna go hero merch they wouldn't want to have happen is I'm gonna have it wait one hour okay I'm gonna have it wait one hour now what it's gonna do after a person checks out is it's gonna follow up with them and upsell them something so let's imagine we know our most popular product is our hoodie so what it's gonna do is it's gonna send out an email now what this email is gonna do is it's gonna send them and I'm not gonna write the hell entire email right here but I just could create a new template right out my email what this email is gonna do is it's gonna sell them our hero hoodie I have to wait 24 hours at least wait one day now what it's gonna do at this point in time is it's gonna wait and see if the person bought the hoodie or not so we're gonna do a sort by tag and if they go through right here and they have bought the hoodie okay if they have bought the hoodie I'm just gonna put in hero hoodie black there we go and what its gonna do is it's gonna see if they bought it or not so let's do this if they do buy the hoodie we're gonna send them to an upsell and we're gonna sell them the iPhone case see how that works now if they don't buy the hoodie what we're gonna do is we're gonna send them a down so we're gonna send maybe a coupon for 20% off of the hoodie now we can endlessly and infinitily do this we could actually just keep doing the down so over and over again if the person still doesn't buy we can have it wait another day and I'm not gonna fill out these ones cuz you kind of get the gist I can have it sort by tag again to see if they bought it now if they do finally buy it then we can send them directly to our upsell boom we can send up to the up so again if not we can send me even better discount like hey we'll give you 50% off but you have to act now then on the discount we can do the same exact thing we can have it wait one day and and if it doesn't go if we don't go and sell that iPhone case what can we then do we can upsell them again so we can sort by tag okay and so if they do have it let's just say if they've bought by now we're just gonna stop selling to them so if they do buy it we're just gonna go to stop if they don't buy we sit in one last email giving them a discount on that iPhone case this right here is humongous when I was skinning my star in internet marketing the easiest way to increase how much money you made from a product launch was just adding an upsell this is adding an upsell and then down sells this completes a trifecta and this right here will easily add another 10% to what's going on in your store now finally what I want to show you is a secret thing I wasn't playing the show in this video but it's called L T V and this is what it means so what I can easily see now that I pulled all my sales data and all my customers in the market here is I can easily see all right I want to see everybody that is coming from my store hero merch all right well we got 25 people now I want to calculate exactly how much they're worth to me on average every single one these people is worth 11 dollars and 59 cents to me but what I'm gonna see over the next few months is I sent email sim these people are gonna keep coming back to my store what's gonna happen is they're gonna keep buying more and more and I'm gonna suddenly see dude when a person comes to my store and begins checkout on average they come back and buy more products and so I'm gonna gradually see this number go up and up and so let me put out a scenario to you let's imagine right now we're on Facebook and we're selling a ten dollar t-shirt in order to make this product even work we need at least at least get someone there for five bucks we need to make we need to spend five dollars to get a ten dollar sale now let's imagine this our competition gets really fierce and the only way we need a ten dollar sale is by spending ten dollars but let's imagine these people then come back and we're able to track everything we're buying we're saying WOW every single person that bought for example let's just do this one right here let's just do this tag for this this t-shirt right here so we have one person let's imagine this person right here it costs if they're LTV for me right now is $56 so I go right here hit generate LTV this person is only one person who's bought something so far so they're worth $56 to me but then let's imagine this person comes back and buys another t-shirt and buys another t-shirt I'm gonna go WOW for every 50 six dollar sale this person on average comes back and spends twenty more dollars on my store so if we apply this right here and we say okay so we just made a $10 t-shirt but I know every person with a ten dollar purchase on average comes back and spends about twenty dollars more with me what does this do our competition has to stop their ads but we don't have to because if we spend ten dollars to make a ten dollar sale we know on average this person is going to come back and spend another 20 bucks with us so what can we do we can outbid our competitors and still stay profitable even when all of our competitors go oh man it's too expensive now to get a sale we can go no it's not every person comes back to the store and over time spends 20 bucks with me in the next two months and in the next six months spends 40 bucks with me and this changes how we do everything because every big brand online usually breaks even on their ads most big brands spend ten dollars to make ten dollars but then what happens is they email their customers afterwards and they keep sending them and they make another ten dollars and then they keep yelling again make another ten dollars they make another ten dollars and they know this and so they know on average for every ten dollar customer they acquire that person on average is gonna spend 40 bucks with them and this changes the entire game and everything I just showed you takes a few clicks to do inside of market here oh that's it that's how easy this can be that's how simple this can be and so that's all I wanted to do for you guys today I wanted to give you this training and show you four methods actually five methods right now that you can use to increase your sales automatically now I'm not gonna do a hard pitch here to you guys I'm not here to do that but what we've done for you guys is I've gone and created a 100% free Shopify course that breaks down how to do each of these methods and way more detail okay and if you click the link somewhere around this video if you click the link it will take you to a page where all you have to do is simply sign up for a free trial market here this is 100% free you can cancel at any time you are not gonna have to spend a dime and what you can do is you can go through this course and add these tactics to your store and you can see the results and then once you see the results if you like them you know maybe keep market here I'll keep the course if you just want to get the course and get the course and cancel market here I don't care what you do I just want to give you guys some awesome value in this video so this has been Alex Becker CEO of market hero and overall pretty neat guy and I really hope you enjoy this video and this right here I just want to really stress whether sign up for market here or not whether you check it out you need to understand we're working with stores that are doing 500,000 a million a month and applying these tactics adds instantly an extra 20 to 30 percent in revenue that's 200,000 300,000 months we apply this to a store that's making fifty thousand a month it increases it to a $70,000 per month store and you don't have to spend any more money on advertising you don't to do anything else I am begging you whether you hop on this or not apply this to your store and start emailing because the number one way to make more money from your business and the easiest customers to get to spend more are the customers you already have so it's been Becker I'll catch ya on the flipside amigo pal buddy okay I mean I don't have an awkward non awkward way to end this video so I'm just gonna end it right now

TITLE: How To Avoid Email Spam and Promo Tabs With Your Email Marketing
VIDEO ID: -iThV6Ho48M

================================================================================

hero Nation what's going on this is Becker and welcome back to the market hero blog uh where we we tell you cool stuff and how to improve your email marketing all right but today we're actually be getting into something that's extremely cool and this is something that can increase your business 20 to 30% literally overnight without you doing anything different and that's hitting the inbox not the promotion tab not the spam tab every single time with your email now the cool thing is at Market hero our delivery is like out of control good so like I can inbox even using words like free and money and refund guarantee and the subject lines of the emails which is nuts okay that's something I've never been able to do anywhere else and that's something you can do too but what we're going to be doing today is we're going to be sitting down with my head of email um who is actually the genius behind our delivery and everything like that and what we're going to focus on is what you need to know to make sure that you're hitting the inbox every single time these are quick little tips that you can apply in about 30 minutes that will increase your delivery rate all right you get a 10% higher delivery rate you'd make 10% more money okay that's huge for like 30 seconds of work we're going to be focusing also on like headlines to get higher clickr rates and what we're seeing that allows us to hit the Inbox and also get those High open rates from good headlines that actually convert okay so we're going to hop in right now and dive straight into that okay guys so something really funny we did the really demonstrate Market Heroes inboxing and just like how to make sure you inbox like a champ uh our head of email actually just sent these and so you can see right here we actually sent out an email right here and if you know anything about email you know having a headline like this um and then having this content in here uh you can see right here we have Viagra sex porn PayPal wire online bank just this stuff right here they will always get your your email sent to spam and you can say we're still inboxing that with Market hero so that's just kind of a testament to uh how good the delivery is is over here you can just see that the emo right here that went in um I know there's some weird topics right there but that's all the stuff to get you knocked out and we're still hitting the inbox with that um so just just first off right here step one inboxing I suggest you try free trial of Market hero that being said I want to go over a bunch of things that you can do when you're about to email that will drastically drastically drastically improve your inboxing and this is really how you troubleshoot out of the promo tab how you troubleshoot out of the spam tab so the first thing I want to show you kind of how to do is you want to go on a Goog Google and you want to type in SPF record setup tutorial now I'm not going to show you how to do this right here there's there's actually a video of me showing how to do this I'll put it below this video just in a link it's just a really ugly basic video but you can find out how to pretty much do this this anywhere and if you don't know what this is you need to you need to figure this out like right now okay because an SPF record right here is going if you don't have this it doesn't matter if you're using any other autoresponder and this tutorial isn't so much even if you're using Market hero I mean if you're using Market hero you'll still inbox but you still need to do this with Market hero but I want this tutorial to be helpful to you if you're sending emails in general because that's the goal of these videos that provide just as much value so maybe you'll check out the company in the future um so what you want to go is you want to go do this because if you don't do this you're you're going to miss the inbox you're going to hit the promo Tab and you're going to hit the spam box talks a lot and what this does is it basically is a digital signature so when you send out an email from your from email so if I send you an email it's from alexit Market hero.io what's going to happen is when you shoot out the inbox that you sent to is going to check back with the domain you're sending from to make sure this is a validated domain um and so that's really how you can tell what a fake email is from just basically a person using a fake domain they have no authority over so I can go anywhere from be like you know send from alexg google.com and SPS will shoot back to Google and say we don't know this person so that's essentially what it does and what you also want to look into if you really want to improve your with Market her that's pretty much where you have to stop but if you want to look into improving it even more you want to also set up your dkim dkim record as well and this is going to further increase your inboxing if you're sending out a lot of emails right now and you're hitting the promo tab or the spam inbox a lot these two things right here are going to help you dramatically okay D dramatically it's like the the back in the beat DJ version of dramatically right there so next thing I want to get into is making sure your domain itself is not blacklisted for example we had a person hop on about a week ago and they had a big list and they were sending out emails but every single email went to the spaming box and as you can see right here you know delivery like I just showed you in that that picture is not an issue okay once you have your SPF sub but what you're going to notice a lot of times and what you want to check especially if you're seeing this problem and you're consistently in the spam inbox it might be the domain you're sending to in the the account or email you're sending from for example one of my just email addresses long time ago at a website you st just would always hit the spam inbox and it just got blacklisted in Google's Gmail for some reason the way around this was simply changing the email so instead of making it like alexm marketer.com it would be like Bob marketer.com or Alexander marketer.com or IO that's our website so that's another thing you really want to look at right there and that's that's kind step two if you're still hitting the promo Tab and stuff like that and then what I want to show you to do uh inside of here is really how to go out there and troubleshoot your email so what I like to do I'm going to kind of walk you through my entire process is you know first off you want to make sure that you have the SPF set up and so with this email right here I usually send from Chuck's email at Market hero so if you see anything from Chuck that's why I send for him because the the delivery is just so good from this email right here uh when you're sending for Market hero so then what we're going to do right here is I'm just going to select who I'm going to mail to let's just say I'm saying the source wave right now and actually I'll change this to Source wave okay cool now what I do and I don't so do this anymore at Market hero because um it hits the inbox regardless of what I do I could put free money in the title it still hits the inbox but what I want to do is let me just go pick an email right here that has um maybe some money let me just type in money right here let's find one that has like money in the key the headline there all right so here we go right here so here's an email basic one right here to get sent out and I want to show you how to really troubleshoot these emails if you hit the promo tab or the spam inbox so there's a series of tests that I do when I'm sing at a test email I'm sending to myself so if I send out a test email or I send a test email out to myself and I see it hit the promo tab or the inbox the largest culprit is probably going to be your subject so the first thing I'm going to do right here is I'm going to put in um I'm going to change the the subject line to basic subject line okay so I'm just going to make it so that there's zero reason why the title would be a reason for us not to hit the inbox okay and so what's going to happen first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to hit that and I'm going to send that to myself again okay and when that goes and hits uh the promo tab again I know okay cool it's not the headline it's something in the content of the email there's just sometimes where a section of your email is going to cause that so the next caller that's going to happen right here is probably going to be your images okay so again with Market hero if you're sending stuff in the image area uh if you're sending images you're going to inbox anyways but if you're using other R SM you're probably going to run into this where if you send an image a lot lot of times it's going to hit the promo tab it's almost the difference between hitting the inbo and the promo tab a lot of time so all you need to do is just simply remove the image okay just remove the image send out the email see if that's the reason it didn't hit okay and if you're still hitting the promo tab it has to be something in your text okay and there's a lot of ways you can get around this okay so words like you know free money uh income all this all the stuff to Chuck run in there what I like to do or what I used to do when I was at another odd responder and I'm not I'm not going to pick fun at other OD responders I do that enough but what I would do is I'd find sub subs for these words basically words that mean the same thing and people read them the same way but they don't trigger the same spam response okay so what I'll do is I'll first actually go through and I'll look at certain sections that might trigger it off so I'm look at this one right here if any of them have dollars on your online business right here so what I would do is I delete this section and then send out the email again okay and if it's still in the promo tab it's not that section I just gradually remove sections uh until there's nothing left in the email okay and this is a pain usually you're going to hit hit the inbox by this time but if you're not right there when you get to the section that is knocking you out of the inbox okay uh and if just by the way if you if you have a normal email and it goes out and hits the promo tab there's something wrong with your domain you're sending from or the autoresponder you're sending from it's more than likely your domain there's no autoresponder out there that can't hit the inbox with a proper email um so once you realize which part of it is knocking you out of inbox just put a quick note down like put the put the subject of the paragraph somewhere in the text file so you can kind of see stuff that c es the promo tab from your autoresponder so what I do a lot of times when I'm writing my emails just to avoid this the first time around is when I say when I want to say free in the email I'll say no cost okay when I want to talk about money I'll say bucks or buckaroos okay I I'll use slang for money instead of using the word dollars or money or stuff like that okay when I say income I'll talk about you know um you know I something generated income actually works pretty well um like a lot of people will say money generated and stuff like that um or you know how much money you make a year I'm going to say it will increase your income um it will increase stuff like that so one thing you want to do when you're thinking about writing out emails and stuff like that um what what I could do like if you want I'm just saying if you like want to type in like porn or something I'm not saying you're going to type in porn I just want to show you how you want to think about you put in maybe you know adult videos okay or something like that you want to change the words around whatever you're doing so that was a weird example actually way to offend everybody but like payday loans okay like if you put in like payday loans into whatever you're typing out out there you could put in something instead of like get the bucks on the same day okay that's not like proper English but you can see how like I go in and kind of describe with this type of loan okay you can see that's that's really a weird way of saying payday loans but I want you to take away that there's ways you can change the text to get out of the promo Tab and still get your message across in your email so you know these are just some tips right here and this is exactly the process I go to to make sure I hit the inbox every single time because when you hit the inbox if you get a 20% 30% higher inboxing rate uh you make more money you make 30% more money it's one of the easiest things you can do to increase the income your business makes that being said um if you want to get this like I showed you before you know we're inboxing with the titles free money and putting images and all sorts of stuff in our emails you know Market hero does that if you have your SPF set up correctly but you know if you're on other I responders this is a process you should probably be going through and you need to set your SPF no matter where where you're at okay a lot of a responders don't make people do that when they come inside um we do and the reason for that is because you know a lot of a SPS want people get in with least resistance as possible but there's a downside to that it kills their delivery it makes their IPs just awful so uh that's exactly what I do and that's what we require at Market here so we keep our IPS really clean and delivering good so this is just a quick little checklist if you're interested in getting this type of delivery just try the free trial below this video uh and if not stay where you're at and use these tips to go and increase your delivery so this has been Becker and I will see you around the general vicinity of Market hero okay take it easy

================================================================================

[Music] hey you cool email marketer you what's going on this is Becker CEO of Market hero again and what we're going to be getting to in this video uh something that's very important and a lot of people Overlook and that's how to bring a lead onto your list to make sure they stay on your list for a long time look you bring people in from ads and if you're able to get them to adopt and hop on your list and open your emails and actually become a commended customer that person's going to be buying from you for years and that increases your value of a person that jumps on your email list from maybe 16 to $50 to $60 and outrageous stuff because these people eventually buy everything you're sell so I'm going be talking to you right now about how to bring on a lead turn them into a fan that consistently buys from you without you even needing a sales page so we're going to hop into that right now in the market here blog and uh that's all there is to it so let's do it okay guys so we're inside Market hero and if you want to go create a free TR blow and follow along um I think you should because what I'm about to show you another other system on the planet can do and this one little step right here is going to be why everything in this video is going to generate you or 2x or 3x your business if you go and apply it because nobody does this nobody tracks this and this is why nobody thinks like I'm about to show you how to think so you can see right here if we just type in one tag of people that came on uh to my email list right here it's about $83 people I paid about $6 per lead and on average I made about $26 back long-term value from the people that came on this list now like always in every video we're going to focus on getting the long-term value the amount on average every lead pays for on a list to absurdly high numbers because because when we have this I'm paying $6 lead I can keep scaling my business to the Moon okay and you're going to see how to do this in this video and the real key to this and the real three factors that go into this equation are the length of time you can get people to stay on your list the amount of opens clicks and uh interactions with your business every time they open and click an email that's a new time to be sold to and the amount they buy and the thing I'm going to show you the simple stuff I'm going to show you in this video increases all of those things to the point where you get a massive Roi Pro lead in fact I'm going to show you how if you get one lead out of a thousand people to become a longtime List member they can pay for a, leads four times over okay so the whole key to this and the whole point of this video is to get people to stay in your list for the longest amount of time possible and open and click and interact and like your business as much as possible and there's a really simple trick to doing this but you need to understand three rules before we get into this the first thing you need to understand is there's no such thing as buyers if you've been in internet marketing for any amount of time people are going to tell you there's free B Chasers and then there's buyers and if you can get an email list for people that have bought something from you they're going to buy 10 times more but you don't want freebie chasers on your list and this just isn't true whenever you run an opt-in online whenever people opt into your blog they haven't bought from you yet they're after whatever free bait or whatever thing you're offering to join your email list now look almost 95% of people that join your email list have a credit card almost 98% of people that have joined your email list have bought something online there's no such thing as a person that that is not an online buyer in this day and age especially if they're opting in this stuff the problem is they don't have enough trust and Rapport and positive expectation to buy from you they are buying stuff everywhere they're just not buying from you what we need to do is convert them into buyers into people that trust us the difference between a freebie Chase and a buyer is a buyer has already interacted with your brand they've already bought something from you they gone to know you and they have hopefully positive expectations to buy more from you that's the only difference they've had time to build trust and Report I'm sure you've opted into email us before where person starts trying to sell you right away and you know what happens you never open their emails you never do anything with that business again because you don't know what the freck they're about all you know is that they're just trying to get money out of you that's why a lot of freebie Chasers become very worthless leads now the next thing you need to understand is the best sales tactic is positive expectations if you go into the Apple Store there's not a zero there's no copywriting in the entire store there isn't like big signs that say it does this this and that and the features it's actually in very small text next to the computers if you look at any businesses online that are killing it the reason they're so successful is not because they have amazing copyright people focus on selling and copyrighting and all sorts of stuff out there that's not it okay the thing is their customers have positive expectations they know if they buy something from the person it's going to work it's going to be good okay so you need understand when we ingrain positive expectations of people we don't even need copyrighting for example I launched a online university we had a a very very weak sales page and we grew the business to a believe $40,000 a month reoccurring income reoccurring income uh with this very weak sales page just by saying hey guys we're opening up something new it's going to be great uh we can only let 300 people in boom sold out literally in minutes okay so we have to ingrain these positive expectations so people buy without needing to be sold to this is huge now the next thing you need to understand also the positive expectations before we hop to the next part is that if people have positive expectations they're going to click open and stay on your list for a very long time now the final thing you need to understand is it only takes one long-term buyer okay and we're going to be creating many more than just one long-term buyer out of a thousand but it only takes one person out of a th who absolutely loves you to pay for an entire list of leads okay so for example say we get a th000 optin at $3 a pop that's kind of the average-ish you can get on Facebook and other sources that will cost us $3,000 now look there are people just like this on my list that been on my list since 2013 okay um there's people on my list in the past year that have done this we have multiple people that will come on my list and just one person buys a $1,200 per year software we have for example a software called Source machine it's $99 per month that's $1,200 per year we have people that have been on it for almost a year now okay then another person or the same person goes and buys a $2,000 per year service we have another service that is $200 a month okay that's about $2,400 a year let's just round it down to 2,000 boom just right there that one person is paid for that list of a th000 leads now here's the kicker every once in now again I'll pitch a program that's $5,000 or $8,000 uh through one of my Affiliates or or someone out there now um these are very high prices and I make sure these programs are amazing and get results that being said that being said I have multiple people on my list have done this exact thing this exact thing and this one person has paid for a thousand leads off of Facebook that's absolutely huge and so what we need to really focus on is not selling up front not going and getting the best C and being as salesy as possible what we want to do is we want to create as many of these people as we possibly can if we have two to three of these people per thousand we are killing it we're smoking it and the business explodes that's why right here I want to show you this if you go into Market hero and then we go down to my uni ad funnel right here this is just a simple ad we got about 31 leads into it okay by the end of the funnel they make me about $484 that's pretty good if you're paying about $4 per lead I just created a list of 31 people um essentially for free from Facebook so I'm paying about four bucks per lead in this Niche right here but here's the kicker all right the pro the people and all the trust I built from this list uh it doesn't end when they get to the end of the the stream the end of the funnel right here and what you're going to see happening right here is we go right here and we look and that person gets tagged with uni funnel right here when they went through um what you're going to see and this is it's usually not going to be this consistent the conversions are not going to be this crazy but you can see right here we got about 30 contacts on here okay and two of these contacts right here bought I believe one of them bought the Hero Academy uh from Market her right here and another one went through and bought a multiple thousand course and so just these 31 people right here on average I generated $54 per lead all right you can see how valuable just two people in this everybody else in the list hasn't even bought anything okay these people might be be dead leads but you can see when they come through on the list how valuable they are if you can go and build those positive expectations if you can build that amount of trust you only need one or two people to do this so let's get into how to do this now step one and you can try to do this with other tracking if you want you need to go inside of Market hero and you need to go and create your tracking pixels this is how we're going to track what people are buying from us in the first month the first six months the first year the first two years the first three years and this is how we go and calculate that LTV okay that's so important that's so incredibly important if you can't track this you're not going to see the benefits of doing what I'm about to tell you but once you track this it becomes so comically easy to grow your list in leads because you see exactly how much every single one is worth to you so what happens next is I this is a basic option I've ran forever okay I've been running this forever because it's just so profitable I showed you exactly how much people are worth to me when they come on my list okay so I do something a little bit differently than other people when leads opt in all right so I'm just going to enter this email right here so you don't understand when most people op to an email list the first thing everyone's going to tell you to do is sell sell sell right away to make up the cost for leads you can do that that works it'll make you break even but here's what it's going to cut you cut your earnings in half over the long term because what happens when you sell to somebody right away is they don't get to know your business they don't have a chance to become in their mind a buyer they don't know who you are when you email them they don't they don't know if you have their their best interest in mind they don't know anything about you okay so there's no chance to build any positive expectations but here's what I do okay and I'll actually link to this video um in a call out annotation on YouTube when you're watching this video be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel as well it's it's groovy um that being said in this video right here what I do is I introduce myself as Alex Becker I say hey look everything you just opted in for is right here at the bottom of the page you're going to get everything we're not even going to try and sell you we're not you can see right here I say this is not a sales video because I want them to listen up I say look my name is Alex Becker I'm the CEO of source wave we help tons of people get SEO results we're going to be sending you a ton of 100% free training that is awesome it's going to help you out so much and on top of that what you just opt for we're not only going to give that to you we're going to deliver 10 times that we're going to give you a free train that shows you how to go out there and make money with it to build it around your business whatever you want to do with it on top of what you just opted in for so what did I just create here one the person knows who I am so when they get an email from Source wve they know hey that's that cool guy who gives me cool stuff two when they see an email from Source they go hey it's probably that training and extra cool stuff you told me about three I overd deliver right here without being salesy or pushy and what happens is that creates positive expectation the result is people are open my emails they're clicking my emails and when I eventually sell to them guess what they're going to have give me money it's probably going to be something good because right here they gave me their email and something good happened okay so they go through and they get the training next thing happens they see one of my emails they click on it they get more training and something better happens they get they get even more training and more free cool stuff and then I send another email with more free value and training more positive expectations are built and then I pitched them then I pitched to them at that point in time and that's how I get really really high conversions with very simple sales Pages you can see for example right here here's one of our sales pages right here for Source University okay extremely extremely extremely simple and all you can see is I just put testimonials right here there's almost there's almost no copy on this page at all this thing converts like crazy when I mail people from my email list that's it and I have a sales video right here that's it it's very very simple and so that's how I get people to convert really highly now I want to show you the funnel behind this right here here's the exact funnel that people are opting in from uh when they come in so let's zoom in a sec and I'm going to show this to you um so when we go in here we look at the funnel right here you can see from the actually this email right here every single person we've generated almost $4,000 just from that welcome video remember that first welcome video where I didn't sell anything at the end of the first training what I do is I simply link to Source University and say hey if you want to hop in on this uh here's a crazy discount if you like this training that you just got you're probably going to like a load more and you can see right here we've generated a ton from it we have a 55% open rate on this email 36% click-through rate because of the the positive expectations that I create okay so as we keep going down the funnel what we do is we just keep sending people more training you can see from this email right here a 35% open rate absolutely huge because of positive expectations and what's in this email right here you can see I'm generated $2,000 from this email right here and this is just a value email I'm making money simply sending out valuable information so if we go right here and we just look at the email what's happening right here I'm just sending them training I'm just sending them training in the simplest email format right here and so when they go through and they click on this we go right here and we teach them something cool and so you can see how you can see how this blows up my cost my my long-term value per lead because people trust me and at the very end of this funnel right here guess what happens you know they go through the funnel and then maybe that's when I'm going to pitch them that $5,000 product that's when I'm pitch them that $88,000 product now is every going to buy that no maybe one two or three people out of a thousand will buy that but but because of that guys that they pay for everything that's how I get that massive long-term value and the only way you can do that is by creating that positive expectation and trying to convert every single person that comes onto your list into a buyer when you try and sell up front and you get a 3 5% conversion rate after the optin 5% of people become long-term customers when you do this 50 70% 80% I don't know the exact metric become long-term customers they come people that trust you and they become those one or three people maybe they didn't buy upfront but they become one of those three people that buys that $5,000 product from you so that is why this is so damn important that is why this is why this is the best way to sell and this is why the best this is the best way to make that 8X 10x eventually after two years you know maybe 20x Roi and every single lead that comes onto your email list it's huge it's huge so that being said this is the lesson for today remember create positive expectations to keep people on your list longer and then Focus on creating making every single freebie Chaser that jumps on your list a buyer and then remember it only takes one two or three people to pay for a th000 leads remember that so this has been Becker again there's a free trial of Market hero below if you want to do all the marketing all the stuff I just showed you in this video

dudes dudets what's going on this is Becker welcome to the webinar if you've been here already you know we're going to be starting shortly if you're watching the replay what are you doing man I invite you to hang out with me on a Thursday night you say no no I'll deal with the virtual version of you later because I can't stand you in person it's just rude but let's get into this guys what are you going to see in this webinar it's pretty cool you're going to see my simple email followup uh that is making me $1,532 a day it actually doesn't make me that exact dollar amount every day that would be pretty cool all right that would be like some mumbo jumbo magic if I made exactly $532 every single day on top of that 12 Grand but it makes me around that sometimes I'll make 15,000 sometimes I'll make 20,000 sometimes I will make 10,000 or sometimes 9,000 some days bad bad you know that's how much it's making me on average and what I'm going to show you in this webinar my big promise to you is I'm going to show you how to quadruple business by fing one simple email metric that let you get un limited leads and an 8X Roi and it's going to be done without a complicated funnel without large ad spend without selling experience and uh not even without any kind of product all right you can actually do affiliate products if you want you don't need your own product yet at all you're actually going to see all to sell a lot of your own product as well but I want you to take that all in for a second okay and in fact you can actually be downright bad at selling and I'll still show you how to get an 8X Roi on your leads coming in it's actually really simple okay so my goal is if you have a business I want to make scaling it to an eight fig straightforward and easy all right I want to make it straightforward and easy scaling your business to eight figures or seven figures or maybe even six figures okay maybe High six figures you pick your number right now pick where you're at business-wise if you're at $ zero just say 10,000 a month if you're making 10,000 a month let's say 50,000 a month and just multiply it to a reasonable number okay I'm going to show you my goal is to show you to make that very easy I'm going to make it very common sense I'm going to turn it into math by the end of this webinar you're going to have a point and shoot math mathematical process to get there because in business it's not about feelings and Feelgood and like personal warmth and all the kind of crap you see in a lot of webinars it's about numbers when you know your numbers you know how to manipulate the numbers you can build a business as fast as you want now look if you're a beginner I'm also going to give you the simplest way to create a five figure per month business on the planet in my opinion email marketing is the most consistent easy downright simple Tod do form of internet marketing once you understand your numbers if you don't understand your numbers it's like mumbo jumbo using the Jedi force okay it's like it's like becoming a Jedi it doesn't make any sense but as soon as you know the numbers makes a ton of sense it's very easy to do so if you're a beginner in the right place as well now look on top of that I really want you to learn this so I'm going to incentivize you learning okay if you say down in the webinar what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you three things I'm going to give you swipes that you can use in your emails these are swipes that I use for my emails to get me a consistently very very high click-through rate okay if you are having trouble getting clicks you're having trouble you want more clicks you want to see a pattern you can use it's very simple to do in every email it's going to show you to do it I'm also going to show you an 8xr funnel template this is actually how I go and get an 8X Roy from all my leads you can actually go and copy and paste it into whatever you're using right now hopefully you'll be using Market hero you probably already checked it out because it just rocks okay it's going to say effing Rock but I'm going try and avoid saying [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in this webinar oh damn it okay that's the only time I'm going to cuss in this webinar I just had to be stupidly sarcastic but I'm G give you that 8X the 8X Roi funnel template as well and finally guys what I'm also going to give you is a template you can use that I've been using in the bodybuilding Niche internet marketing SEO you name the niche I've giving it to other people uh this is a template that usually gets me around 60 to 80% op rates that drives my cost per lead to the ground and I'm going to be giving that to you as well if you stay in this webinar if you leave one minute before this webinar ends there will be an old lady waiting at the door who will throw rocks at you it's going to be very very dramatic it's going to be a bad life experience and you also won't get these bonuses so it's just going to stack on top of each other now look what you also need to understand about this webinar guys is why this webinar is different this is going to be an a Tob training it's not fluff it's not Theory this is math I'm gonna say math like 10 times in this a hundred times I'm gonna say logic and facts okay it's going to be like the presidential election except it's going to make sense we're going to talk about the policies okay that's the last time I talk about the election right now but you're going to see not a bunch of junk where you just go and you go oh what the heck is this you're going to see straight up mathematically how to grow your business I'm going to show you a to B how to piece together so after this webinar is done you can leave this webinar and mathematically grow your business gonna be straightforward and easy now I think everybody here knows who I am give me a three if you know who I am hopefully you do you're on my list you got here there's all people like throwing Trump and Hillary in the comment section relax calm down okay I moved to the Cayman Islands to get away from people like you come on just relax all right let's talk about the new Star Wars movie coming let's let's talk about an happy thing anyways guys if you don't know who I am which you probably do because you're on my list that's where you're watching this webinar right now real short my name is Alex Becker um here's a picture of my car so you know I make some decent sum of money and I'm having a lightsaber so you know I'm Carefree too that's that's cool um here's me talking on stage to a bunch of people at my event we had about a thousand people there for my book launch uh we broke the National Best Sellers List almost every single one in the nation New York Times had a pro off my book so they wouldn't put it up there even though we sold enough to break their list but whatever that's cool so that's how you know people listen to me and here's a picture of me with Grant Cardone so you know I got cool buddies all right so this that's the effect I'm trying to achieve hopefully I look cool right there now my quick story right here I grew my first business from um absolutely nothing actually $6,000 I had when I got out the Air Force to a little over $5 million a year in Revenue now how this business really grew from let's just say I was making probably about $500,000 a year to $800,000 and how it grew from that amount to $5 million a year was through 100% direct response email marketing okay the I'm going to show you in this webinar I do every single day every day non-stop that's why design Market hero that it's just so consistent it works so well and you can scale it so well once you know the numbers and facts that it's just it's it's like science and I like things that are reliable and I like things I can predict okay now my true skill like I just talked about is mathematically growing businesses okay and let in a year I was able to take my business from like $ 1.5 million to $5 million and I was able to help a lot of other businesses get the same growth literally just by talking to the owners and saying dude this is exactly what I'm doing you're going to see the exact talk I give to them in this webinar okay I have five years of selling all PRS of products I've sold Services I've sold client work I've sold you name the type of product I've sold it via email marketing okay infom marketing Client Services software it's all been sold okay so what I'm really good at and my true skill is getting leads for about $4 and at one of my businesses Source way for example I make about $22 back over six months okay how many people here would be okay spending $1,000 per day if you're getting leads for $4 if you're making $22 back on every single lead over six months give me a one if you uh you'd be okay with that give me three if you'd be okay spending $10,000 a day if you knew you were making a $15 Roi on every single lead that came in yeah it makes business really really freaking easy and that's the point of this webinar guys I'm going to show you how to make spend $3 on a lead spend $4 on a lead and make 15 $20 maybe even $30 back I know a lot of people that actually make like $50 back um I actually know one guy who's spending about $15,000 a day and making $150,000 a day back uh in sales so I'm not gonna I'm not g to show you to be quite that good but that's the key right there so I've had a lot of success doing this and that comes from doing that came that comes a lot from doing things the wrong way okay this go to we and things he's block blocking up and I can't even like see my slides but how I got here guys and how I kind of developed this process I'm about to talk about in this webinar and I know I'm giving a lot of talk right now but I want you guys to understand the frustration I had reaching this point okay because it wasn't necessarily easy and you're really going to Value the information I'm going to give you and understand why it's important okay um if I give you the sword of Zeus okay it don't educate you on why the sword of Zeus is so zeusy okay it's not going to be that zeusy to you as well okay so that's that's the explanation right there but I learned a lot of this from doing things the wrong way okay I started in a slow lane in a business that didn't have any control okay after doing this for five years look guys I have a way to get leads and get them to get me an 8X Roi on every single ad dollar I spend it means if I spend $1 making about eight back okay I talked about that before all right I have a way to get in limited leads without being anyone's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you didn't understand how many people here have to write content or or or mess with Google and I'm not talking about bad about SE or anything like that I'm just you have to deal with some somebody else to get your leads you cannot go and say I want 500 leads a day give me a one if that's you you have whether you're doing JV whether you're doing I mean even with SEO if you're doing any Ty of marketing there out there maybe blogging or stuff like that yeah a lot of people are pissed off yeah that's exactly what I did all right for years I would literally just do the same exact thing okay and I did this all guys by finding a simple metric that effortly allows me to buy leads I'm going to get into that here in a second and then basically what I do when a person comes in at this point in time is I have an email pattern you're going to see in this webinar gets me a huge Roi with intense without intense selling without intense copyrighting without having to really go out there and and do that much because people trust me as they go through the funnel and I have the ability to inject any of the above into any business and make scaling simple and trust me how many people here think give me a three if you think there's no freaking way I have like a I have like a blueprint that I could give you in this webinar would make scaling your business simple it's very it's okay everyone here should be hitting three I would be hitting three too it's okay okay I'm going to prove you wrong but n we you're GNA be like Dam that's so stupid easy okay now I already talked to you about this before I've going to ask you a lot of loaded questions in this webinar but I really want you to have this question down as we keep going through this webinar how easy would it be for you to scale your business if you paid X for lead and made 8xi how easy would it be to buy ads give me one if it would be super easy to buy ads yeah give me one if it'd be super easy to out do your competitors everything becomes really easy when you know how to get that Roi okay that's the few things if you can go out there and you can buy look guys I'm not let's let's not even talk about that 8X Ro anymore let's talk about simplifying if you can go out there and you can buy an email and get two times what you paid for that email back your business explodes the end okay if you spend $5,000 a day you're making $10,000 a day back okay you spend you're spending $50,000 a day you're making $50,000 a day that's a dream for most businesses by the way okay I'm going to show you how that's almost laughable let's just aim for that during the webinar all right maybe let's not go for the 8X y that's kind of dramatic that's kind of click baity that gets you on the webinar let's think about maybe a 2 to 3x how many people here give me an X if you be okay with that yeah someone there's someone said f yes that's cool someone said yes that's the dream um and like I said before guys it all came down to one metric and if I can get this metric in any business I can scale any business in any niche as far as I want okay and I did just that but I did the hard and expensive way all right actually I did it I it was like it was like taking something that is long hard and covered in sandpaper and then trying to do caveman drawings with it you thought I was going somewhere else with that but it was awful it hard it was expensive let me talk to you about it all right so look in order just to do what I did now or how I got to this kind of point I had to pay 15 up front for an infusion soft okay and then I had to pay about $1,000 a month just for that software okay so that's like $2,500 like out of my pocket just to like the sword of automate funnels and crap like that okay then I had to learn how to use said software and pretty much rip apart my business okay there was a point where I was doing a lot of JB stuff and to start this up I had to rip apart my whole entire business my cart systems my funnels everything okay now also being said I had to buy another tracking software so I could track what my leads were buying okay um and then with that also being said trying to combine infusion soft in this system together the the lead tracking system and then my split testing system and then my just goes on and on none of them track them correctly either just going out there and doing that I lost a lot of money trying to go through ads just trying to get the systems right not testing the ads not going out there and making sure my ads were were okay and converting literally just going up there making sure oh crap this link was not right oh crap infusion soft isn't tracking how much sales I'm from this funnel right here oh crap andely Lost the link again that link accidentally got deleted it's not working sorry okay give me a three if you can kind of hear my frustration this is like the dark times okay this was this was my this was my struggle in life hard struggles right um so basically I had to go out there and test and test and test different email strategies too once people got in so basically I'd be spending thousands of dollars in in advertising and not getting any money back that's everybody's nightmare nightmare that's why most people don't do email Market in the first place and I what I found is a way to get around that really easily I can't believe I go back in time I'd kick myself in the heiney all right and so I said I have to go out there and spend hundreds and hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of spent all right now once I was able to nail it though guys how many people here give me an next if you're like screw that I don't want to do that like Alex why would I do you're like I don't want to do email marketing no more man I don't want to do it that doesn't sound no fun guys once I figured out once I mastered this by combining all this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] together okay my business jump from an unpredictable no control $1 million a year business and by the way I was making a million dollar a year and it was stressful all right I had to do like JB launches be like yo man promote me and I had to be making like videos every single day I have to be making all this like content so what people would come in and opt in and I'd have to go and find more people like hey promote me and I have to come over like this magic Gizmo like money robot XXX type of product so people would promote it and it had to have crazy copywriting had to do all these sales videos maybe like the launch would tank maybe it wouldn't then maybe like people would buy after and then I have to find good procs and then piss off all my customers it was all over the place all right I was making a million dollars a year and it was it was like eating sandpaper okay but once I master this guys how many people are give me a three if that sounds like your business just all over the place you're making money but it's like wow man this is not this is not this is not fun okay it's like jumping out of a plane and trying to like catch dollar bills on the way down but here's how I got away from this guys I did all this because I was in so much pain I was so relying on other people for traffic and until you can control your own traffic you're done you're done okay and that's what this webinar is really about and that's what Market Heroes really about too okay it's an autoresponder but it's really about controlling your traffic so once I got this down guys my unpredictable no control business went from a $1 million business that was stressful sell to a $5 million business where guys I don't I'm running Market hero now and Source wave is still pumping out4 or five million in Revenue a year all right I'm fully CEO at Market hero I'm not doing that much I do a webinar at source wave about once every week I send a few emails every week we do about a promotion every week I send out some value I have my coaches send out some value that's it it's easy and it be scaled from a $1 million per year business to a four to $5 million per year business but not many people want to go through all this stuff and it sucks because all this stuff right here that I just went through stuff that's preventing you from doing and that's probably why you're not doing what I'm doing okay I said before look how easy would it be if you were getting a three to four times houry in your leads how easy would it be if you could map it out and track everything they were doing and seeing wow man that lead that came in I paid $4 for I me $16 back in six months you said that's the easiest thing on Earth but that's this stuff I just went through is what's stopping you from doing that okay um what I want to show you is I know you want the easy way does not involve tens of thousands of dollars spent on software but most you guys can't even afford infusion soft I understand you don't want to hop in infus and soft and pay a thousand dollars just to get like training like an education on the software what what the hell is that I know you guys don't want to go out there and spend hundreds of hours learning autoresponders you want to be out there doing your business maybe you guys aren't all internet marketers maybe you just want something that's simple that you understand it works maybe you guys are tired of spending tens of thousands of dollars testing ads and email strategies and connecting 20 different gizmos together all right again how would your life change if all you had to do was track and increase your long-term value that's what my business is I don't focus on anything else I get leads in I put them through a funnel I increase how much they make the funnel makes me and I increase the long-term value of the leads and that's how I get the 8xr I'm about to make it very simple to you okay now that's how I've G out there and I fex my business from you know $25,000 or $2500 a day th000 a day to $112,000 per day okay again guys I'm always going to keep asking that question how would your life change if all you had to do is track and increase your LTV which we're going to get into here in a sec and getting limited Roi leads tomorrow okay that's it if you can go out there and you can prove to yourself my long-term value on this lead is $8 $12 $16 you can start marketing you can start making money tomorrow give me one if you agree with that that's true if you knew it if you knew that number but you don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] know that number you don't and that's why my business is going through the roof right now in a very small Niche SEO software is a very small Niche okay the biggest company right now is like Moz and I think they make like1 19 to 15 million in Revenue that's not profit then you can just cut that in half okay it's a very small yet Niche okay you don't know that you don't know that number now look real talk these results are not typical but I I don't even know why I'm putting this up there because this is how almost every Big Business scales okay I'm not selling you some make money online Pro I'm showing you a math problem okay I'm showing you m equals MC s or whatever that that Albert Einstein thing right here is I'm not going to do any more Albert Einstein quotes but I'm showing you a Maps problem all right if you know if you can go out there and you can calculate out your long-term value of a lead and then buy leads for less than that long-term value the results are very typical you will make lots of money you will make a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of money actually so I'm just gonna skip that so I'm gonna go through what I like to call the three Catalyst I'm gonna show you to get your number more so that one magic growth metric number the LTV of your lead the long-term value all right everybody type in LTV it's the most important thing from this webinar LTV all right that's the most important thing if you get that everything else in your business can suck all right because now you know one number to focus on and guys someone said httv that's good too that's good too all right but guys the secret to business and that I found in a few years I'm doing this is identifying one or two numbers that grow control your entire business for my business it's it's the amount of money I'm paying per lead and the long-term value that's it that's it that's all I focus on okay if I can get that that first number low and that second number High that's it I'll I'll run ads all day all right now the second thing I'm going to show you this second cows is I'm going to throw you show you a three-step way to email your leads to get a massive LTV Roi on every single lead and it's simple you don't even need to be good at selling okay and I know a lot of people here like this guy's full of he's going to sell me some make money online thing no trust me it's going to be really simple it's it's you're going to be like wow that's really easy Alex i i i i you're looking at things the wrong way the biggest thing when it comes to making money is not secret tactics it's the way you look at it I'm going to change the way you look at email marketing everything forever in this webinar I'm going to show you how to combine these together to get literally unlimited leads not not literally because you could run out of people on planet Earth but let's just let's just go with unlimited because it sounds good you can get literally unlimited leads will'll get you an 8X Roi and a competitive Marketplace even with a high cost for lead or optin okay even if the even if the price for optin is $8 and all your competitors are like what the hell everything's so expensive you're going to be able to Breeze through there and be like oh this makes sense I totally get what I need to do all right so callous one is I'm going to show you how to get the metrics it makes scaling your business easy mode AK your long-term value okay now look it's obvious but let me spell this out for you guys you should get it by now LTV is the average amount you make email pretty easy okay it's a total amount of money you make over time per email okay when that person hops in through your optin when that person comes into your business and you start selling them something it's not how much they make you in the first day in fact I don't make anything for my leads almost in the first week actually no that that's wrong I actually went through my funnel today we just started up we started up a new source W paid funnel and um we're actually doing really well on the first email even though we don't sell anything we just send people to a video where we like talk and teach like own stuff so it's actually funny and I didn't know that before but Market Herer told me It Isn't that cool that's really cool I'm already like learning stuff from it so that being said guys the amount of money you make over time from that email and what's going to allow you to make money a lot of money is understanding how much you make in your first week how much you make in your first month how much you make in your first three months and how much you make in your first six months okay and for the sake of this webinar we're only going to speak about long-term value in the term of six months time because that's a long time and I don't think anybody wants to wait a year to make their money back okay but we're going to make make a lot of our money back actually all of it in the first month so look the key to of growing your business is identifying this LTV okay if your LTV if you know it is it's $22 after six months all you have to do to grow your business is is this like there's it's everything's done you just spend less than $22 on a lead and you make un limited income that's all I do I do this every single day now what you need to understand is that getting this number is borderline impossible okay because accurate tracking out here let me explain why it's so hard to get so the way a lot of other autoresponders work is they don't have this first off okay so you have to use other tracking systems that kind of like Loosely track what people are buying over time but here's the thing when a person comes in which you'll usually do with these other trackers is you'll send them through a tracking link okay so they'll have a cookie applied to them now how many people give me a one if you if you clean if you cleared your cookies today everybody here I cleared my cookies today day that's a big problem because once that tracking cookie has been uh removed in the first day the first three days you can't track people anymore it's a big pain so for almost a year I was trying to track people using this system in a combination of infusion soft and infusion soft doesn't have a way for me to track it without me ripping up my entire cart it all it takes is just the impossible all right going nuts okay it doesn't take the impossible anymore let me show you how easy it is to get this metric in your business today let me hop over to Market real here real quick all right and um so let's go through it okay let me let me walk you through the entire process actually in Market here we're going to make this I'm going to show you how incredibly complicated it is how to set up your tracking how to do all of it okay so first things first we're going to go over here to our products Tab and I'll bump this out so you can see what I'm doing right here okay so what we're going to do is we can go right here we can click add new product and so we can put the name of the product I'm just going to put this best product ever okay I make the price 150 bucks and this is going to be the tag that's assign to anybody that buys this product and um then I can go right here and I can add to the Alex Becker tab okay so I'm just going right there add to the Alex Becker tab boom it's done okay so then what I'm going to do let's imagine this is affiliate product let's imagine this is any type of product all right you think of the product that you're selling it's that type of product right it's the best product ever so we do right here is we go and we click here we grab this conversion pixel and we paste it on our thank you page give me a one if you can do that give me one if you can do that that's it you're done your conversion tracking is done you're tracking people and seeing everything they buy in your business for 6 months a year two years you're done you're done that's it that's it so all you do now is you send emails from AR camiro you send people through your streams every single time they interact with your email anytime they go through an optin anytime they interact with Market Hero at all the tracking pixels that we have on them are reapplied to them so they're going to see and we're going to be able to calculate everything they buy and when they go through your streams here's an example of an ad I ran the other day as an example instead of market so this is one I ran the other day sent 31 leads for here and what we did is we pitched Source uni okay so the people have already gone through here the lead systems already over that's why you don't see any people in here anymore but we sent 31 leads through here all right over the course of going through this funnel on average each lead spent $484 Isn't that cool give me me a three if that's pretty cool because I can already see exactly how much every single lead that came in that funnel funnel is worth you see how easy that was give me one if that's really easy all I had to do is send people through an optin I didn't do anything else it's done okay now I want to show you a few things that are happening here automation wise that allow me to also improve this LTV M because remember it comes down to two things going out there and increasing or lowering the amount we're paying per lead and increasing our long-term value so what I want to do it here is I want to find ways to increase that long-term value for example when a person comes in here they have the tag applied to them uni funnel okay so this tells me what funnel they came from so I can track exactly what funnel they went into how much they're worth in that funnel every single one of them so it's very easy for me to go track and this is how much they're worth when they go to the funnel not how much they're worth over six months so what goes on right here is we go up here and we send them an email okay now if in an hour's time right here if a pixel's hit actually I'll just go in here and just edit this right now we're not using it too much anymore there's no one going through it so if a pixel is hit right here what's going to happen is it's going to wait 2 hours 1 hour whatever time we set it to and what it's going to do is it's going to send them a follow-up email if they bought it so if they buy it immediately it's going to send them a thank you email okay now we don't even need to send them a thank you email if maybe your system handles the thank you emails you can do all sorts of stuff like that now if the pixel's not hit what we do is we send another follow-up email okay say hey man why didn't you buy this if the pixel's hit again we send them to a thank you email if it's not hit we send them to a free trial offer you see how we're going out there and we're constantly upselling or down selling the person give me one if you see that based on what they're doing and I didn't have to set up anything complicated at all give me a three if you think you can do that all you have to do I'm going to show you easy it is all right here's how you do it let's get an email right here we're going to send an email right here we're going to connect them together we're going to go if conversion pixel is hit okay and then what we're going to do at that point in time is we're going to tell it to let's go pick let's just do Source CCS for this example let's do time to wait let's do two hours boom we are now making reactive sales-based funnels like that yeah Isn't that cool give me a three if that's pretty cool now what I'm then able to do guys is I'm able to go through to my leads okay now I'm going to go right here and I'm going to go has any tags uni funnel I want to see exactly how much these people are worth to me boom okay there we go loaded up every single person that has the tag uni funnel every single person went through there okay so I can see right here I'm going to go and I'm going to generate the LTV pretty simple you can see every single person goes through there it's worth about 30 bucks to me because they bought other products you can see actually one product person went through here you can see boom spent $950 you can see how that is pretty cool right I can go back there and also one thing I want to talk about right here is how fast this moves try and find any system that moves this fast give me one is that pretty cool I I'm easily able to go through you saw real quick let's look at this you saw right here first off when the people went through the funnel you saw they were worth $484 but you saw one person bought one big product and that changed the LTV for the entire thing boom every single horse thing comes in that's $30 per lead that's $30 on average per lead only one person bought anything to how many people here can buy leads for less than 30 bucks give me a one if you can do that someone said this replaces aw completely a isn't even the same Market of us dude this is this is that's like saying hey man does does a car replace a bike we does does I don't even know does a guitar replace a rock drum yes yes there's nothing out there out there that does anything like this okay we have the automations of any top automation software on the planet we compete or go head-to-head with the most active one with active campaigns we go head-to-head okay okay there's not an automation on there that I am looking for that we don't have so that we got right there no one else does what I just showed you what I just showed you give me three if you just noticed I didn't focus on automations at all I focused on money because that's what email's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about it's about making money it's about growing your business with ads and guys you can automate all day you can build the greatest automation ever and you can do that in Side Market hero if you want all right you can draw a freaking smiley face automat automation upsell Extravaganza all right but what it comes down to is this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] right right here that's it your business isn't about automation it's about knowing your longterm value it's about going and look at this right here I can go here to this funnel right here and go hm this is an ad I'm running right now and I can see right here actually from the first email I'm making I've made a total of $980 and I'm making a total of $48 just from this alone just from this part of the funnel I'm GNA go wow that's converting really well okay I can actually see how much we're earning per open too and that's that's pretty cool you can see right here average per lead I'm already making $782 and I started this funnel like a week and a half ago okay I buy leads for $4 I'm making a profit give me a one if that's pretty cool and I know all that about my business without doing anything I showed you before this is all I did I went right here I went to Source wave okay actually Source wave SEO that's the one I'm using right here okay I need to go to the second page because it Scrolls over and I went right here to Source uni I grabb gra this and I paste it on the thank you page that's all I did outside of this that's the only Integrations I did that's anything it's pretty cool right give me a three if that's pretty [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] awesome that that and guys right here I know this about my business how how do I make money guys give me an X how do I make money type it in how do I make money at this point in time if I'm if I'm paying if I'm making $782 back how do I make money I buy leads for less than $782 and that's what Market hero is all about that's why we're different than everybody else because you're able to come in here and say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I can scale my business now because I know the numbers behind my business that's what Market hero gives you so let's get back to the PowerPoint because we got a lot more stuff we got to get into all right the thing you need to understand right here at this point in time guys is getting this end all number is now as simple as copy and pasting all that stuff you said before man it's it's hard Alex I'm not going to be able to get it copy and paste it copy and paste it you're done you are now doing Advanced internet marketing all right c 2 I'm going to show you a three-step email pattern that easily increases our LTV to massive rois I've showed you how to get that number now I'm going to show you to make that number really large all right give me an X if you're enjoying the webinar very insecure I need you to constantly remind me that you like this all right so look I know what you're thinking you're thinking Alex that's great but there's no way I can get an 8X LTV on my leads give me one if that's you yeah I would think the same exact thing because 8x if you told me when I was playing the JB Zoo launch game that I could stop launching procs every week I could just kick back and run the same ad and sell the same procs year round and make a ton of money eight times what I'm paying actually I would have said ha there is no way you can make that much money without launching a product and and negotiating with JBS and making crazy sales pages and all this stuff okay someone said I don't believe the 8X H you will in a second I don't I don't even have to I don't even have to like pump it up like I'll show you how easy it is okay so you're probably thinking you know that that's hard that's hard stuff Alex you know how am I gon to do that okay look I tried all sorts of complicated funnels guys I tried all the Ryan dice funnels I'm not saying they don't work they do work okay but Inus the softw impr provely I couldn't do that I couldn't make those type of funnels okay it just didn't work because I didn't like just didn't okay I didn't have I didn't want to hire a consultant to do it so look I tried all the complicated funnels I've tried all the systems what works for me best is a super duper easy follow-up process and it's going to make a lot of sense to you in a second I call this the 8X RI funnel now look person comes in they go through the funnels right here and I'm going to show you the exact pattern right here I'm going to show you this makes sense how many people here go this there's no way this is too simple give me one if you think this is too simple there's no way this could make money few ones so many people are are used to me disproving them in this webinar that they're already not even questioning me but anyways person Ops in all right let's imagine we're paying $2 per lead we get 2,000 leads for $4,000 all right now this is if we come in and and we just suck it up all right everything misses all right so what we do and what I do how many people here give me an X if you've ever heard that buyers are worth more than freebie Chasers everybody here awesome awesome okay so guys all of you guys a lot of you guys opted in on this webinar for free a lot of you guys oped on to my email list for free every single one of you has bought something from Amazon every single one of you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] has bought something from Amazon you are all internet buyers you are not freebie Chasers give me a zero if you've never bought anything online that's right there's no zeros here okay there's no such thing as a non- buyer there's simply people that don't trust you enough to buy from you you need to understand that this is something I discovered a long time ago now why are buyers worth more here's why they've interacted with you before they've tested your products and they've gone through the quality they actually gave you their real email first off that's why buyers are sometimes a little bit worth more but they've gone through products they've interacted with you they probably pay a little bit more attention to you because they actually just gave you money and what this allows to happen is trust and Rapport is built and the key to selling expensive stuff online is trust and Rapport when a person comes on as a freebie Chaser and the first thing that happens is you try to sell them something guess what you don't have guess what you don't have trust and Rapport you don't have a way to communicate with them they are turned off you cannot convince them of anything and the secret to getting someone to buy someone is convincing them that's in their best interest and that they should give you money because they're going to get more value in return if you don't have trust report you cannot sell so here's what I do here's how I make a lot of money back without even being that salesy all right if you actually go on the source wave uh funnel you can actually go hop in after this webinar you'll notice the pitches really aren't that heavy okay in fact I send a lot more value than I do pitches how does that make money H let me show you all right so person comes in they get a welcome video and what I do in this welcome video is tell them all the things I do at source wve uh all the good things that's going to happen all the good stuff we're going to send them what this does it creates positive expectation I'm not going to get into all the copywriting behind it because we're about 45 minutes in this webinar I need to start wrapping it up that being said they see this welcome video okay and they go wow that guy is's really cool he gave me a lot of value and then get sent to another video that's full of value and they go wow you know what source wave doesn't suck dick this place is actually pretty cool I might open their email funny how that works if you want to get people to go and open your emails and buy from you you have to get them to open the emails and actually like you okay people don't just open emails from people they don't like and be like oh okay let's just get that okay all right that's not how it works now at the end of that video what I'll often do is I'll be like hey by the way if you enjoy this stuff we also have this thing called Source University a lot of people buy that in the first video without me even selling all right so then what I do is I follow this pattern I send him value and then I send him some more value okay and I have the value kind of tie into what we're going to be pitching so the first thing I pitch inside of source wave is Source Hunter okay boom value value pitch then what I do again is I go and do value value pitch next thing I sell is Source University all right and I have those funnels I showed you inside 8X Y where if a person misses a value email I make sure to resend it to them automatically this is done through a funnel I don't have to do anything the email is back sent to them again to make sure they click and it keeps being sent to them until they open it okay so I make sure they get value before they ever get a pitch I do that same thing again value value pitch I pitch them Source University then what happens if they don't buy Source University they get offered a free trial right give me a one if you're following along you see how simple this is okay now we're not even getting the numbers yet I'm just showing you the pattern okay and then what I do is I go value value High ticket offer okay this could be OMG this could be uh anything that's anything that's $2,000 to $5,000 okay you could be around that price point now guys I want to show you how easy it is to make your money back even if you suck guys if you go and give a ton of value to people give me a one if you think you could get convince one out of 2,000 people to buy a $5,000 product if if you can't get off this webinar you have no future doing anything okay guys we just made our money back on one sale made our money back in on guys I want to tell you something I sent out a list I I collected a list of a small list of people for a $10,000 offer the other day right I sent an email at the list I said who wants to learn software engineering and development and stuff like that I said it's $10,000 all right I got 10 people to respond to me that's $100,000 done okay why why did people give me why did people give me $10,000 guys because I have trust in [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Rapport that's the funnel Okay so one thing we want to look at right here is just from the small phun right here showing that $1 $5,000 product we made our money back but let's actually get in the real world that's that's La La Land okay and what you need to understand before that guys all of our leads are paid for we made a profit but the leads are still on our list those 2,000 leads don't go anywhere they're going to be on our list buying stuff from us as long as we have trust and Rapport that's how in the first month I make $5 back in the second month I make 8 back in the third month I maybe make 16 $ back in the fourth fifth sixth I make $22 back give me a one if this is starting to make sense someone here someone said you know they paid you 10K for software development class guys my software makes me millions of dollars millions of dollars I what I have to say about when it comes to software development it's worth it's worth 10K all right so that being said guys I'm not offering you a 10K offer in this webinar relax I'm actually offering you you a free way to get in the market hero it's pretty cool um that being said let's get into the real world right here guys let's imagine we suck at selling like you are bad you're just awful okay so person comes in we get 2,000 leads at $2 per lead welcome video value value pitch all right so we sell 15 people on a on a $150 long-term value product now guys Source Hunter the average person spends $29 per month okay but the average person stays for about six to seven months sometimes I think it's it's getting up there it's closer to like a year now the last time I checked a long time ago was like six to seven months okay I haven't been on top of it as I should be okay so that actually means that $29 Sal is worth $150 give me one if you just had an aha moment you just realize how uh profitable reoccurring products are okay so right here I get 15 people to buy Source Hunter at1 19 to $29 it's very it's a very easy offer everybody needs a tracking program with SEO right there I just made $2200 in yearly annual income okay I just paid for half of that that's guys 15 people out of 2,000 can anybody tell me what percentage that is what what what conversion percentage that is someone whip out the calculator and tell me 15 out of 2,000 0.75% not even a 1% conversion rate we suck okay next thing goes right here I get 20 people to buy an $80 LTV product okay that makes us that gets us $1,600 so let's imagine we have another like 20 to $30 product and usually people stay for three months by the way on membership sites guys the usual membership um amount of time people on a membership site is about three months okay Source University we have like a six to seven month one so it's really really profitable um that's why I Us Saw like I put like $150 for Source uni it's like way up there but our tracking is like all over the place I don't even put up there but you can see right here just from that that $80 LTV product right here that's another $1,600 in annual income right there we just broke even in two emails while just giving value okay guys we're break even right now we've made our money back we're at we've made our money back actually we're I think we're $200 down okay we get to the high ticket offer we build this trust for one person buys at $5,000 offer okay guys we are all now up $4,500 we've made that 2x Roi we spent $4,000 we were up $4,500 give me a one if you see that this is with horrible conversions this is not with good conversions this is with really bad conversions but guys it doesn't stop here I repeat this process every single month every single week if you're on my list what you're going to see is on Mondays and Tuesdays you're going to get value sometimes Sundays and Mondays it depends how promotions are going you're going to get value value value pitch you'll get an offer for a software you'll get an offer for something then every 3 weeks you'll get a high ticket offer then it goes again value value pitch every week and because I keep that trust from report because I keep sending value guys this 2,000 leads it's not like everybody unsubscribes okay about 1,500 of these leads are going to stay on okay and I repeat over and over and over again and if I can get one more person next month to buy $5,000 product if I can get one or two more people next month to buy a $2,000 product and guys my conversion rates are a lot freaking better than this okay from my email list alone I sold $1.1 million of OMG that's $500,000 Commission in one promotion guys that that's where it's at you give me a one if you see how easy this is now we just keep doing the same exact process right here even with horrible conversion rates my conversion rates are about three times each so I'll get about three people three people 60 people right there to convert right there it's easy it's easy but guys the reason you don't know it's easy is because you don't have your long-term value number you don't know your long-term value number I do because I track this [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] meticulously and I know exactly what this is and so when I was able to go out there and start tracking all stuff and actually put my long-term value numbers in place I was like holy crap man why am I launching products that's why you haven't seen me launch a product in years give me a three if this gets you excited this is how email marketing is done this is why it's so profitable so do the math guys even with what I just showed you you can still do this and guys it's not hard to build in fact wouldn't it be cool wouldn't it be cool if when you hopped inside uh let's go in right here let me show you this one thing it's really cool it's going to get you really excited wouldn't it be cool if when you hopped inside of Market hero you actually had this whole entire funnel pre-made for you right here actually set up you don't even have to build it and then inside of it it tells you exactly what to send this is where you app the first do this is what you do right here wouldn't that be cool wouldn't that be neat yeah be pretty freaking cool if you ask me okay so sec let me go back right there so wouldn't that be cool guys yeah pretty freaking cool let me hop back to the presentation let me go through actually I want to show this funnel a little bit more right here going go to streams and then we'll go to pre-made there we go so what you're going to get when you hop inside guys just I want to walk you through the funnel too how easy it is you can see what's going on right here it's the same exact process except it looks a little bit cooler because I've added some gizmos into it but person comes in welcome email all right if they don't open the welcome email they get sent another welcome email then what happens right here guys they get the first value email they don't open it they get it followed up if they do open it they get the second value email then what happens right here get the second value email then we get the first first product pitch value value pitch if the pixels hit on the product we let them through go through the next email if it isn't we follow off and try to sell them the product again then we go value value second offer boom boom boom and then what you want to do at this point in time is you want to take them out of the funnel okay what you want to actually do is tag them um with a specific tag move them out of the funnel and that's when you start selling them the high ticket stuff okay give me one if that's pretty cool yeah I think it's pretty cool too guys so let's get back to the final Catalyst all right the final class what's going on here all right c number three how to combine these together to get unlimited highi leads and even competitive markets and bullly your competitors it's actually really it's really easy guys do guys give me an X if you want to know how I decide if I'm going to go on AdWords or if I'm going to buy solo ads or not all right guys I'm going to show you this is this is how I do it this is my magic process how I choose my advertising I go over here okay I go over here in Market hero and I go hey am I getting leads for less than this can I get the leads for less than this this is how much I'm making in the first like week and a half two weeks I just go hey man okay I'm making about $782 back in the first two weeks can I get leads for less than $782 because then I know I'm breaking even at least if you want to sell me leads for eight bucks I know I'm breaking even so that's cool so can I get leads for less than this if they say yes I go all right I'll take a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of them like give me all those leads if they say like man we'll get you leads for three bucks I'm like give me like a thousand of them Let's test with a thousand if that looks good boom let's go off to the races you see how give me one if you see how easy that makes my life someone says I have an ad guy yeah I do but you know how I know how to tell that ad guy what to do I go yo David okay look they we're making $22 back in the next in six months so what I want to do is in the first month uh I'm making usually about six to seven bucks back okay this is actually really high we actually probably had more conversions due to people seeing the ads the first time usually I make about five to six bucks back in the first month go David we're making five to six bucks back in the mon first month I don't want to go in the red past the first month okay so David here's what we're gonna do you're gonna buy Facebook ads for less and you're gonna get me leads for less than six bucks he goes I I cool you see how easy it is to manage an ad guy when you know that number I don't need to know advertising I just tell my ad guy get me leads for less than six bucks man and then when I'm doing solo ads I go man get me leads for less than six bucks when I'm doing Facebook or AdWords get me leads for less than six bucks if I'm doing YouTube get me leads for less than six bucks that's it give me a three if you see how easy that makes it insanely easy insanely easy that's the magic question that's the catalst that's how I run my business that's how I go and buy leads can I get leads for less of my LTV if yes give me all them because I'm printing money guys I am mathematically making money it's not a risk I know exactly how much when people come in through a certain optin and show a certain interest how much they make me if no I move to another traffic Source it's that easy or I increase my LTV so I can use that traffic Source the end the end someone said Deep Pockets no no do you think I go out there and if I see my leads coming in for less than if you if I see my leads coming in at $10 do you think I go hm keep the ad running David let's keep it going no I don't just go and throw money around guys when I spend money I don't spend over $100 unless I know it's coming back to me you need to understand it you don't need Deep Pockets to do this you go out there and you go hm I'm going to test I'm GNA get leads for I'm gonna spend 100 bucks on leads you get those leads in you see damn I'm making seven bucks back in the first month then what do you do guys if you're making seven bucks back the the first month and then you go and buy $1,000 for of leads at $4 per lead is that a risk or are you making money give me a two if you're making money it's not a risk you mathematically know what's happening this is how you scale a business you're not going to see big well you might see big businesses do you're not going to see lean businesses like mine going and throwing $10,000 down and then seeing leads coming in way over budget no I'm going to spend 100 bucks and go okay the leads are coming in a little high let's lower that until we're below seven bucks boom below seven bucks I'm printing money and actually not going in the red very much at all so guys imagine what you could do right if you had the same exact stuff I'm doing right here you knew the same exact things I do if you had an LTB from each of your traffic sources how easy would it be to plan and scale and these are loaded questions but give me an e it would be pretty easy if you knew that if you knew that Google gives you leads that make you 30 bucks if Facebook gives you leads that make you 20 bucks yeah it'd be really easy it'd be stupid easy it'd be as easy as going to your ad guy and saying give me leads for less than that that's all I do I don't do my ads it's that easy I don't need to learn Facebook I know exactly how much my leads are work go go get them all right look imagine what you could do you could buy limited leads that list of people that's maybe 200 or 500 bucks those people on your blog those people on your business those people on your affiliate list those people that you're getting from launches that 10,000 person list could be 100,000 people by the end of this month if you knew how to scale your business the right way okay you could buy unlimited leads for less than you make effortlessly it's that easy hey David go get me leads for less than seven bucks you rely on no one and control your business give me an exclamation mark if you're tired of dealing with other people and you just want to control your freaking business you Facebook doesn't ask me for an affiliate commission when they send me traffic here have all of it they say there you go that's it give me an ex and imagine what you could also do you could get rid of all the inaccurate tools and get back to focusing on your business how many people here give me a three if you're tired of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around with eight different tools and trying to learn complicated stuff and you just want to focus on your business and selling [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yeah all right how Point Blank easy would it be to 5x your business when you can operate like this the answer again is it's easy because you know you're spending less than you are making it is math it is math it is not debatable this is not some internet marketing Theory this is not some make money online process it's math my brothers and sisters okay it is freaking math and this is guys results in you having a straightforward path to a 78 figure business guys here's exactly how you grow your online business to a million dollars you go out there you calculate how much it costs you to get a lead and you calculate how much that lead is making over six months when that month that six months Mark is more than you're paying for that lead which probably going to be a lot more if you follow that adx funnel I just showed you when it's more than that you buy a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of leads that's it that's the straightforward path give me one if you understand it and give me the exclamation mark if that's that makes sense that's the straightforward path this isn't some like magic thing all right look guys in the past hour would you agree give me an X if just changes how you view your online business and look guys this is all I can do in an hour I could talk about this for days literally for days that also being said guys how many people would like more information like this more training like this combined with Market hero give me one if that would be you okay how many people here give me a three if you'd like to get Market hero for free okay give me an exclamation mark if you'd like me to talk about that I I have something to sell but only if you guys want to hear about it okay there we go all right that was that

this will work for you if you're an info marketer this will work for you if you're a professional coach this will work for you if you're affiliate this will work with physical prodcts I've done all these the only thing I haven't sold before is physical prodcts but I taught people exactly how to sell their physical products using what you're going to see right here it's the same exact process as selling an info product actually now that being said it's going to work if you sell software it's going to work for local businesses because you're actually be to see exactly how much every single client it comes in is worth you're go wow dude we're making like five ,000 bucks back and we're only spending 40 bucks to get a client let's scale this to the Moon it works for if you're a blogger and you actually want to grow your business and stop relying on your content and being shared everywhere it works if you're a YouTuber any business that contacts its customers and needs ways to talk to them and sell them things it will work for you okay if you don't have a product that's fine section two will show you how to promote and and look at affiliate products pick affiliate products to promote and create your own products I will actually go into how I design my products to actually sell now look guys if all the Hero Academy did was allowed you to actually adex your business would it be worth $33,000 give me one give me just give me one if like just point blank if it allowed you is just to go out there and get it 3x your business just 3x your business would it be worth $3,000 of course and you're getting actually Market hero in there for free okay now what else do you need what else do you need you need traffic okay you know to build the emails you know to do that but how about the traffic guys next thing I want to talk about to you is the mass system this is a completely other course that comes with it you're getting this on top of it okay what you're going to get is brutal control over traffic guys we have over 40 videos taking you through and sitting down with experts guys I know to work all these systems but I'm not the best in the world at it what I do is I brought people in that are spending $500,000 to5 million per month in ad spend on Facebook on YouTube and I got the individual experts on adwards on solo ads on media buys and with Organic traffic I'm actually teaching organic traffic because I'm pretty good at that actually but I brought the experts in for each of these we have over 40 videos teaching you how to be a master at Facebook how to be a master at YouTube how to be a master at AdWords how to be a master at solo ads how to go out there and do media buys and how to go out there and get organic traffic it's going to show you exactly how to work every single one of these to the Master Level and you're not being taught by like me trying to pull stuff out of my butt I pulled in the Masters to come and teach you now that being said guys you don't need any experience need it and you don't need a big budget you can start for five bucks a day or look guys you can just wait and not even start you can just go through this right there I will show you how to do with Organic traffic and do it for free at the start okay one of the best ways to actually go out there and get your LTV is attract people organically get maybe 200 people on your list see how much they're worth and then go start buying ads so I'm going to show you to do that too give me an X if that's pretty cool all right now guys if the mass system allowed you to go out there and simply Buy traffic for less than you're making say you're going out there and you're able to get leads for $3 consistently from Facebook and make five bucks back okay would that would that go if if it just went out there and cut your ad cost in half give me one if that would be worth $2,000 if that's all it did that's all it did it didn't teach you to be a master or anything like that it just allowed you to effectively buy advertising so you actually make money duh okay and the thing is you're getting it from people they're imagining budg budgets of five thou 500,000 to $5 million a month in spend all right that's a good amount the Nero and they're making an Roi on that or they wouldn't be managing that much people's money all right now look I don't want to leave you hanging I want this to be complete for you I don't want you to have any you don't need to go anywhere else so what else you need you need copywriting so what you're going to do guys is they're also going to get project Edge and this is actually where I kind of shine because I'm very good at copywriting so look guys if you go out there and you hire someone to write your copy not me I will charge you $50 do $100,000 for copy because I hate writing copy for other people and I will charge an absurdly high price and it's worth it okay if you have a product launch and it's going to do $700,000 in sales with my copy it's totally worth it okay getting 10% of a launch is totally worth having a really good copy that being said if you go out there and hire just some Average Joe it's going to cost you $10,000 to write your own sales videos or copy they're going to charge a lot if you get a good one if you get a good one you can go get the cheap ones and it's going of it's It's you're just going to lose money but that's exactly how much it's going to cost now that being said guys you could do that or you could just get taught directly by me what you're going to get guys is I use scripts every time I sell every time I go on Pitch I use scripts I use it when I got started I sometimes use it today and what I'm going to show you is my exact strips for webinars I'm going to go step by step this is what I say then this is when you pitch this is how you close this is how you make the product for the webinar I'm going to show you my sales video scripts you're going to be able to go step by step fill in the blank template my scripts I use Guys these scripts right here literally when I'm writing sales stuff I don't try and get like pretty and crazy and creative with it I load up a slide I load up a PowerPoint presentation it has everything already filled out and then I go through that step by step and fill in the blanks and then I add all the pretty stuff like you see right here that's what I do because it's a sales processes work the process of convincing people doesn't change every webinar it's been the same way for the last 200 years okay the same emotional process the same everything the same copyrighting that worked in the 50s works now it's just in a different format okay top of that I'm going to give you my launch scripts I'm going to show you I write written sales copy how I get people to buy in launches how I get people to go panicky I'm going to show you launches how I sell services to my own list how I sell my own products on my own list how I get people all reved up for example when we opened Source University we opened the business up and we had $50,000 in reoccurring members in the first day I'm going to show you I got everybody amped up and look on guys here's the cool thing here's the cool thing thing when we launched Source University I didn't have much of a sales page there's a video saying Hey this is Source University $50,000 in reoccurring income $500,000 business right from the hip actually $600,000 business because of the email scripts and copywriting that I sent to people leading up to that give me an X if you think that's pretty cool someone say is a professional copyrght right here I approved this message someone said someone said you're a professional copyright how much do you charge for copy just throw it out there I'm going to assume a number if I don't hear you in two seconds because we have to keep going all right you you put it in you put in there and I'll pick it up a little bit later on all right so guys look guys if project Edge just stops you from having to hire a copywriter and you actually can go out there and make 10% more conversion from your sales videos you can actually make your own sales videos without hiring anybody would that be worth $1,500 someone said the copywriter just said a good sales letter is $155,000 a copyright on this webinar okay if guys if this allows you to go make your own sales video get your own sales do this all is that worth is that worth $1,500 give me a one if that is that all it does that's all it does okay so what else do you need guys what else you need pre-made campaigns guys when you get inside Market hero what we're going to be doing is I already have the campaign set up for you and every week we're going to be releasing new funnels with fill in the blank this is what you do at this step this is what you do at this step it's all built for you okay if you guys want to see funnels and stuff like that you hit me up I'll make the funnel and we'll copy it over to everybody's everything okay we're actually going to have like a funnel Market here in a little bit but I'm going to go and make these funnels for you so all guys all you have to do is go fill in the blanks now I don't want to sit up here and be like fill in the blank and make money kind of thing this is going to allow you to have a template in front of you that is proven to work it's what I do and you can go and adjust it to your own business make your own emails in there maybe add in a few different things and have it already set up in front of you so you don't have to go and design everything by yourself when you hop inside Market hero now of course this tourus is going to train you how to use it but Market hero is so simple it doesn't need a course to really teach you how to use it what we what the Hero Academy is all about is teaching you how to become an advanced email marketer so that you can really use this tool to its match you'll understand how to use Market hero out the bat it doesn't even need an instruction manual it's so simple now guys if I make a campaign for you and you're able to use it for the next two years to sell your products would that be worth a thousand bucks by the way guys you can go to I'm not hating on Ryan dice at all but you can go hit up Ryan dice you can go hit up any these other businesses that build people's funnels for them it will be $77,000 minimum for them to build a funnel for you minimum minimum minimum okay if these funnels if you're able to use these funnels and actually use these to start your business and use this for the next few years and maybe sell $10,000 worth of product is that worth a th000 bucks give me one so guys look the total value we've agreed on we've agreed on that I'm not pulling this out of my butt these are numbers that I asked you if it's worth you told me and you've told me this is worth $949 I believe it is I believe if if all this this did was allowed you to 8X your or five let's say 3x your business if you went through this course and all it did was allow you to twox your business by in the next three months but would it $10,000 give me a three give me a three that'd be worth $10,000 if you were able to go out there if you're making nothing right now and this allowed you to make $10,000 per month would this be worth it a lot of Threes I'll screenshot it right now so people watching the replay and check it out but yeah that's just realistic value right there would it be worth it the answer is yes but look we just went through what if all this offer did I just talked about if it made buying traffic easy if it gave you the ability to just twox your business if it gave you the ability to limitlessly scale to go out there and turn your 10,000 person business to do 100,000 person business Heck if it just allowed you to focus on growing and stop playing with gizmos it would be worth it we agreed on that now look guys with the Hero Academy I have two options I had the option to go cheap as possible and Walmart this as much as possible how many people here have bought little cheap courses that don't really work and the person didn't put a lot of effort in all right give me one if that that's what you bought you bought those little Walmart courses all right I didn't want to do that okay I wanted to go all out with this so my second option was to require a little bit higher investment but give me the ability to overd deliver and guarantee success okay guarantee it all right guys we talked about this one metric the ability to scale at will what is the ability of going out there and getting your LTV consistently and being able to increase it to two to three times what you're paying in a nobs way okay what is that worth to you it's worth a lot if you're able to go out there and get that metric we talked about that $10 per lead that $15 per lead and you know how to get get that and more importantly increase that and consistently get that with any business you hop into you're a millionaire you're a millionaire and this is not some make money online pitch this is not some secret system this is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] math this is math and I'm going to show you how to use math and straightforward actual real business marketing not some make money online [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] not some secret ninja path not some pattern I discovered in my mom's basement freaking goddamn math sorry for using the GD word that's what I'm going to show you to do right here okay look we've talked about how much this metric is work and I've really put the value on it all right it's worth 25k this year it was worth 20% growth in your business we know how much this metric is worth now remember the cost for me to go out there and get this guys I had to go out there and get the software I had to go out there and do the ad spense I had to go out there and do the testing I had to go out there and do the failing look if you were down with 24K a year and software cost it will cost you $24,000 a year and software cost to do what I did and 100K in learn wasting your money on Advertising by all means go go go somewhere else okay but what I want you guys to remember real quick before we also get into this is before you invest in this guys I want you to remember the definition of disposable income okay look guys if you go take money in your pocket right now and you go spend that money on the TV you go spend that money on your power bill you go spend that money on I don't even know a guar all right that money is gone that is gone okay the goal of money the goal of disposable income the goal of investing is to go out there and the goal of being a good entrepreneur is to go out there and always spend on stuff that's going to make you money back if you go spend that money on TV that money is never coming back if you go and spend this on this right here this money is coming back if you apply it we talked about the math behind it you can go out there and you can apply this to your business your business is going to grow the end if you can go out there and get leads for less than you're paying for them your business is going to grow and Market here on the Hero Academy are going to teach you how to do that that's the goal this is an investment this is money that's coming back to you okay so look you can see why this is a good deal at even $5,000 okay

internet you'll go through them they're dead I don't use infusion soft all right I'm using this system I made this system for me it's the best freaking thing ever like I use it's it's amazing what this thing does um it it just is like you can go right here U I don't think this one actually where's one where we did actual tracking with the mail but you can see how many emails I'm already sending from there so like I can see like this one right here I made $3,676 from that's like something i' never do an infusion soft without like connecting a thousand things and there you go someone said I make the first 50 um ask her to support guys also being said our support is standing by at all times I don't know what I say weird stuff to our support and stuff like that our support is here you can

there waiting to reply on you like at any time so there you go so pretty easy you see how simple that is so that's a support system too you can expect that type of support someone how's said how's our email deliverability top of the market I'm not I don't advertise that publicly on our sales page because deliverability can go up and down sometimes but right now the way we vet our email the way we go through our system and we have Chuck melany this is literally I brought him on as a partner on Market hero because he is the master of email he is obsessive compulsive with getting delivery all right you want to see how delivery is right here here here it is right here Gmail is probably the most hard to one deliver not hit in the promotion tab um let me just go where where's the last email I just got out um go and start messaging you ask you a few questions make sure your leads are good and then they'll let you import them all right we're very we're not stingy all right we will help you

guarantee someone said I just want to confirm Market hereo integrates with clickfun allowing us to build our funnels with clickfunnels and use Market hero as our autoresponder yeah if you go out there and you use our tags and everything in there you can integrate just fine with it we're going for an actual in clickfunnels integration we're building that right now with Russell someone someone said I'm in can I dump click funnels no you want to use clickfunnels through your landing pages their landing pages are amazing their landing pages are amazing you want to use clickfunnels for for the landing pages do we integrate with optimiz press yes here's how we integrate guys and actually if you want to see how we integrate inside of the system right here you go to training videos and actually we on every single page you actually have an infographic that shows you to use every single thing you have a video showing you and if that's not enough there's a training video archive right here that will show you how to go through and do all the Integrations everything we're working with how to how to op any optin form software we integrate with all right so someone said I'm willing to buy but I have no email contacts unless I missed it will I be able to create a quick email list Within site Market hero yeah you can import your emails in or you can start your Le email list from scratch inside Market Hero whatever you want to do someone said do we integrate with easy webinar we are integrating with demo we are integrating with go to webinar we integrating with webinar JM at this point in time someone said give me a kiss Alex there you go let's see um someone said wise all right so guys what's going to happen when you get in you're going to go through Market hero let me go real quick you're going to go through and this is how we make sure oops let me go through actually show you the onboarding all right so when you go through guys hero.io slash what you're going to see is this okay and so what you're going to do this is how we make sure you know to use Market here and you get the most out of it when you complete this you're going to go down here you unlock your T-shirt your T-shirt will be sent to you the t-shirt looks like this it's actually it's a really nice t-shirt like this is a t-shirt you actually want to wear I'll actually do I'll turn on my webcam right now so you can see the one I'm wearing where's the webcam where that they show me on the webcam can you guys see me is it showing me it's a nice t-shirt look it actually like fits good doesn't look shitty unlike me I look like I'm like a dank little dungeon right now I'm like not looking at cuz the camera's up here but like you're down here so there doesn't really make a lot of sense but yeah it's a sweet shirt um if you're one of the first 25 you'll get one of these and if you're not you'll get another shirt that's equal quality it just doesn't have the names of all the members on the back of it so it's pretty cool I'm going to close that down now people can see you turn that off someone said what are the otos there's no upsells there's no upsells we don't do upsells this isn't some internet marketing like crazy make money online offer um that's it someone said phones click the link yep let's see someone said what exactly do we get with Market hero um everything we covered in the webinar dude everything there you go all right so someone said do you explain the credit system guys credits are equivalent to dollars so what we're doing when you come inside is you're getting $1,200 free okay you come inside what's going to happen you're going to come inside and what's going to happen is you're going to go right here and guys how credits work it's not like credits where you need to send emails or anything like that it doesn't run on credits okay it doesn't run on credits so what you're going to do you're G to come in you're going to see a page just like this you select your contact amount all right so if you select 10,000 you're going to be paying $ 129 monthly but that's going to be deducted from your credits okay so you have $1,200 worth of credit in the system okay so every single month your account is going to be build $129 out of your credits not your credit card when you run out of credits about 10 months in then we're going to start billing it whatever's left on your credit card every month so after about 10 months you're going to start being build 129 a month because you're added credits does that make sense you don't need to buy any more credit you still have the account you still have the system it works like any other software give me one that makes sense very easy very easy um someone said Alex if I didn't use the go to HTML link am I screwed yes you no no if you use the market Hero Academy as long as you get into the academy you're good if you use any other link um you're not going to get all this stuff you're not going to get all this bonuses you're not going to get all the stuff we talked about and you're not going to get the $1,200 worth of credit um so someone said all right look I have multiple clients is it possible to segment per email per opt-in per product yeah it's really easy so let's say we're building we're building multiple client emails right here all right let's hop into the system okay so um first up we can create different tracking and stuff per client right here in the products area but say we want to make different funnels all right so here's how we go and segment between different businesses all right let's just say this is business a Biz a all right B get it all right um so person Ops in go right here action apply tag we're going to set tag business a boom set that up boom all right so now every now every lead that comes in the system will have to tag business a and you can easily say all right who's involved with this business what have they bought what are they looking for so example I can go right here to leads after I've segmented to them by business okay I can go all right so who who a lead uni funnel let's imagine that's a business and has also as a tag source uni okay so I can see exactly what people in this business bought which whatever and then there you go so you see how simple that is someone says Market hero have email ction forms for web price or have to figure out something to grab emails from organic traffic all right one you can use any other optin software in the planet or guys we have a really good optin software too okay so you're going to go right here you can create a button of any kind and how it's going to work is uh let's just say we're going to make this one 320 and I'm going make the height let's just make the height like uh 64 all right and I can do whatever I'm like you know click here to optin or we can use a button I usually just like to use a button as a link okay um but you can make an option right here I can just go here and use a button or you can use a link you can literally just go and create your own link right here for example and you can link this anywhere on your site and what we'll do is go through place on your site site you're done okay so then what we can do right there is we can go and embed the code and it's a little popup and what's going to happen when people click that link is a form that looks like this and it is um it ends like that I'll show you right there but a form comes up like this you can go and change this and you can click their email now we're also making this a lot sexier but you can go change anything about it and it basically works the same way as lead pages okay so it's going to work it works exactly like where's the page um let me go there we go and it works exactly like this so here's an example there you go it's going to work exactly like that so you just you upload an image and there you go so you already have your own optin software inside there um and so there you go and it also integrates with any other optin software on the planet so let's see so do I have an affiliate program for this not yet not yet we don't need Affiliates right now like I said guys I don't really need Affiliates cuz I know the ads so someone said how quickly can lead emails be acquired instantly instantly someone said what if I don't have a list or a product or I'm just wanting to start email marketing that's exactly why you need to get this all right and look I wouldn't be telling you to pick this up if I didn't believe in it guys you have seen my ads on Facebook give me one if You' seen my ads on Facebook all the time give me one you seen you seen yeah all the time guys this is what I'm doing this is how I grow Source wave I believe in this so strong

today to start using Market hero credits right away yes it does but what you can do dude is you can literally just get the lowest the lowest um membership and that will give you like an account for like two years okay so that that gives you a lot of time all right so someone says how do you track customer client value if they're clients and they're closed offline that's easy okay so you're going to go find the email that's in there so let's just say um we're gonna go and grab let's just go let's just go grab I don't want to give out my email um let's go grab this guy right here all right so what I'm going to do right here is I'm going to go grab William I'm going to go and apply add tag and I'm gonna apply whatever he bought so uni oops Source Hunter all right so there you go you're going to apply that tag to it and then the value will be applied to them just like that oh what you can do after you close the client to you can simply send them to a page a thank you page whatever they're closed or just have them check out online and then have put the pixel on the thank you page as well does the market here have an API yep we have an API right here boom oops and you can plug it in anything there is you guys want to you guys want to see a really cool automation you want to see my favorite actually automation you can do right here give me one I'll show you something really cool someone say can you upgrade uh can we upgrade the context if we get more leads yeah all right this is what I think is really cool this is something is also imp to do in Fus and soft that I kind of dreamed off so this is what Ryan dice tees a lot of and it's really hard to pull off so let's imagine we have a person come in right here and we're going to send them a value funnel that reacts based on what they're interested in and then sends them to a pitch and then after that pitch is done send them back to the funnel give me an X if that sounds cool pretty complicated right all right so person Ops in we're going to apply a tag right here um so we know what business they're related to and we can track them uh and segment them in our list okay so what we're going to do is we're going to send an email let's imagine this email right here um is about working out all right so let's just say this is um workout okay save done all right so this email right here is about working out if they click it what's going to happen is oh my voice is giv out I'm GNA hate you guys in the morning all right so if the link is clicked what happens is we're going to have a tag apply all right we're going to name this transa okay boom okay so this is really cool now if that tag is applied right there what's going to happen let's imagine right here if they don't click it they're not interested okay so we're going to send them to a delay of like a day and then send them to another email okay another email in the funnel we can get a lot more complicated I'm just keeping this slightly simple because it's about to get really cool okay so this tag transa is applied now let's say we have another complete sales funnel right here so we're going to go right here and we're make this workout funnel okay so what's going to happen we're use a new thing we got added about two weeks ago called the start action this is my favorite Automation in all Market hero because what's going to happen is when the person comes in you can do this in Shopify too for example when a certain tag is applied and a person doesn't buy something in a certain amount of time what happens is they'll go through the start action because they'll be tagged with that and they'll get sent with a follow-up email if they don't buy the upsell or whatever I'll get into Shopify stuff a little bit later on um in there so that being said guys this start action right here what's going to happen when anybody ever has a tag applied to them trans a they're going to get yanked out of the funnel they're in and sent to this funnel and start getting pitches for workout stuff okay so let's imagine when they get two pitches for workout stuff I'm just going to keep it simple because um we've been on here for almost two hours so I'm going to keep this kind of simple and they get two pitches for workout stuff okay then after workout pitches are done what we're going to do is we're first off going to remove a tag we're going to get this trans tag off and uh oops let me move the go to webinar thing and we're going to do is we're going to apply the uh we're going to apply another tag called return a okay so that applies to them right there now here's where it gets really cool all right so we just yanked them out of the first funnel after they said they were interested in something and sent them an offer that they're interested in and now what we want to do is we want to get them back to that funnel okay we want to get back to funnel so what do we do we use another start action right here we connect it to the email sequence we make the tag return a and it will take them out of the last funnel they were in the last funnel they were in where they get the workout thing and continue them down the value funnel and we can do this over and over and over again give me a one if cool we can just keep going if they click this email right here I'm not going to go and draw us again we can apply another tag and we can make this trans B and send them to a completely different funnel based on their interest and then return them back to the funnel awesome someone said yes I don't understand don't worry you don't need to do this stuff to make the large Ry yeah can you see the different R can you see the LTV for different traffic types yeah so for example if I want to make a Facebook optin all right I make this one Facebook actually what I could do is I could have three different ops okay so I go right here I have this opt here op in here op in here okay all right so when this up when this person comes in here they get tagged with Facebook all right when they get in here they get tagged with AdWords and when they come in here they get tagged with poopy poopy butthole all right you guys had me on here for a while so you're losing the mature Alex all right um sorry anybody watch give me a three if anybody here watches Rick and Morty someone said can you do a JV zo optin yes when people when people buy products through JB Zoo you can apply tags and through the start action that will start funnels and all sorts of stuff so JB zoo is integrated with us as well okay so yes there's two people watch Rick and Morty so you got it Mr Poopy butthole all right so then we GNA have the email sequence right here and then what we can do later on is we can go back to our LV LTV area right here and we can go and find everybody that has a tag Facebook and see how much they're worth everybody has a tag AdWords and see how much they're worth everybody has a tag poopy butthole see how much they're worth pretty cool right so anyways guys I'm going to wrap this up I'm going to start closing on the webinar the Alex Becker Academy the extra $300 in credits the um Enterprise level support and what was the last bonus that we offered what was the last one we offered there's a fast action um and the ticket the Heron which is going to be $497 I'll go away and um let's just say two minutes okay I'm getting

hey what's going on this is alex becker and in this super quick 5-minute video i'm not only going to show you how to set up your market hero app on your Shopify store I'm also going to show you the potential that when you combine market hero and Shopify together you're gonna have a lot of functionality you've ever had before ways to upsell your customers way to down sell your customers ways to go and make sure your customers buy what they're originally checking out and hit them up for cart abandonment and basically the sky's limit you're going to see a lot of really cool things here and this is just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do you're actually can go crazy here well let's just start beginning alright first we want to do is go to the app store where there's a link in your dashboard install the app just like any other app that there is now once it's install what we want to do is we want to go over to market here and get our API key and assign a default tag so I'm going to go over here in our settings section and we're going to load that up and your API key is going to be right here in the settings section you can see it right here then you're going to click copy key and you're going to put that in there so this is going to integrate you you're done right there okay okay so once you put in the API tag we want to come down to default tag right here and what this is going to do is tag every person that comes in through our store we want to set this up so we can sort people by store and segment them instead of market hero as you can see right here if I go and type in let's just say my store is source wave okay it's one of my businesses imagine to shop by store I can see everybody that's came to store and as a part of that store this is really useful if per se you have multiple stores ones a snowboard store and you want to separate your customers and talk to them individually you don't want me talking to people to wiener-dog store the same way you're talking to people at the snowboard store so I'm put in wiener-dog guitars right here's a tag and hit save okay you're announced you hit enter and you can also add other tags for example like I don't know tag two and then tag tag three just make sure they line up perfectly with how you put the tags instead of market here so this is all saved boom we're good to go okay perfect now let's get to talking about our product event tags okay these are really simple too so when a person checks out or begins check out for a product we're going to sign a tag team you can see right here I have guitar a check out ok so it's the same way we apply tags just with a default tag except will happen when they're checking out certain proxy say a person is checking out on your product guitar a-ok this will be assigned to them they start and start the checkout process now let's imagine they purchase it suddenly we're going to put a money a tag right here because this is the money tag instead of mark here it shows what people bought for example right here I can see every single person that bought source uni in the system so far ok you can see I had their numbers and dollar amounts right here that's what that's going to allow us to do so that's really cool this is a cool way to track exactly how much people are worth and what they're buying and who's bought what and who's not bought what ok now let's get into the potential right here let's get in the cool part this is where your minds going to start to be blown I create this funnel right here and what this funnel right here does in this instance is it creates a cart abandonment system and an upsell system inside of market here so let's start from the beginning and remember you can drag and drop everything that I'm doing right here right from the start so first thing is going to happen right here it's record what I like to call or what is actually called the start action so whenever the tag guitar 8 checkout is applied it's gonna remove people from all their other funnels and actions that are going on inside market here we can also turn it off if we don't want to but I prefer to turn on so not getting conflicting marketing messages so what's gonna happen right here it's going to wait 15 minutes after that checkout tag has been applied now what's gonna do at this point in time it's going to sort by tag alright the tag is going to be guitar a bots we're going right here and putting guitar a thought remember the money sign because that's what we use for that and it's gonna sort people when they come through now what's gonna happen if they come right here and they haven't bought yet they're not going to have that guitar a bought tag yet so what we need to do is when you send the car abandonments we're gonna send an email right here it's going to send them something saying like hey man you didn't buy the guitar ok then it's going to wait again ok it's going to win another day or so or two days or whatever you want to set it by right here this one's set 24 hours and we're going to grow it here we're going to do sort by tag again if they stolen had the purchased tag we can offer them a special aka down sell on guitar a to just get them over to line and get them to buy something ok now if at any point time they do buy we're going to be sorting by tag remember we're going to sell to it up self we'd be like hey maybe you want to buy a guitar B and we can do the same exact thing right here where we can do the sort by tag again if they haven't bought it yet so another upsell or some another follow-up email do the same exact thing Sam is special and so this right here this simple funnel that I built right here and you can see how easy it is to build the stuff this isn't rocket science I can go right here set the time set the email it's really easy to do this right here shows you just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do inside market here just this right here this is going to increase your sales but like 30 percent because you're hitting up the people that didn't buy originally following up with them saying hey man what's going on while you're not buying you're also segmenting them so you can talk to him easier in the future and we can also upsell them easily you could actually build like a 20-item upsell just based on this alone okay now what this also allows us to do is sort people by what they've bought what they've started checking out what they haven't ok so if we want to go and we want to get everybody from wiener-dog we could do any way I can do everybody from source wave that doesn't have the tags source uni okay so these are the people I need to get buying source uni so for example to your store we could do wiener dog Depot anybody it's part wiener dog Depot that hasn't bought guitar a so we could find everybody on your daughter Depot isn't bought guitar a and try and sell them guitar a okay are when your dog guitars it's a different story sorry I can confuse anybody who hasn't bought a product we can search them out and we have a list of everybody that hasn't bought yet so we can start hanging up saying man you might you need to buy this product you probably bought this too or we could find everybody that has that tag and also has the tags has all the tags right here as all tags source wave source uni and in maybe let's just say another one right here source hunter okay I'm not sure how many people have that in this system right here we can go in and generate that up and what that's going to show us is our hot buyers these are the people that are really really into what's going on in our store so we really we could sell them like a whole different program like a thousand dollar program or something really expensive we only reserved for our best fire so the potential is huge right here and it's so easy to handle because all you needed use of these tags inside of Shopify and instead the streams that basically fire on their own in the sky's the limit okay there's literally unlimited possibilities with this there's so many creative ways you can apply this by using the tags and start action inside of market hero so can't wait to see you inside using this and all that kind of stuff this Ben Becker take it easy

[Music] Hey, what's going on? This is Becker, CEO of Market Hero, and uh thanks for checking out this webinar. Thanks for registering to view it. I got some bad news, though. Uh if you're here to get Market Hero, it's completely sold out. So, there was a pitch at the end of this webinar, but I've removed that completely. So, there's no pitch in what you're about to watch. It is just 60 minutes of pure content on how I scaled my first business from, you know, 800,000 to a million a year all the way close to $5 million a year. and it's going to show you exactly how I built the advertising, how I run my email and everything I do in my business step by step and how I went from that point without really doing anything that complicated. So, this is just pure content right here. Enjoy it. It's going to kind of show off what Market Hero can do. Uh but sadly, you you're going to need to wait to get in because uh we're sold out right now. So, um next time we have a webinar, be sure to attend. We'll probably be letting in a few more members later this month in another webinar. Uh but for right now, do not email us. There's no button in the buy. There's no way to get in. We're sold out. So, uh, enjoy the webinar, pitch free, uh, and and taking in the content. So, this has been Becker. Let's hop into the webinar. All right, guys. What's up? This is Becker. I've hit the record button. We're all here on this nice Thursday night. This is actually my first time ever running this webinar live, so it's going to be extremely awkward. I'm going to mess up a lot, and I'll probably drop the fbomb and and tell a 10-year-old joke because I don't even know if we're going to get a recording of this out because we have super limited spots for Market Hero. If you're watching this webinar, you're turning in tuning in right now. What I'm planning to do in this webinar, you obviously know, is I'm going to pitch you Market Hero. But what I'm Let's Let's cut the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for a second. What I want to do is give you 60 minutes of content that basically shows you how I grew my first major online business to a little bit right under about $5 million a year. About 90% of that being profit. Okay? And I'm going to teach you exactly how I did that with email. And really the one tactic that I've repeated for almost the last four years that allowed me to build a simple email follow-up that's making me around $12,532 a day. I don't know if it's actually $532, but someone told me in marketing, you want to be exact, but it makes me anywhere from about 12 to $20,000 a day, uh, depending on what offer and reoccurring thing was running at that time. And the really cool thing about that that you're going to see how to clearly do in this webinar, uh, and Market Hero is really going to help you do this. And by the end of this webinar, it's going to be a no-brainer to pick it up because this is something that allowed me to grow my business, but I had to Frankenstein like eight different solutions together is you're going to see how to get an 8x ROI on paid advertising. How many people here would be okay if you ran paid advertising, you got a 2x ROI on every single lead that came in? You paid $4 per lead, but you made $8 back. How many people would be okay spending $50,000 a day if you could? Okay, someone said, "F no." No. Okay. All right. someone maybe you have higher goals that's fine but if I can go out and spend I don't know 30,000 a day make 60,000 a day I'd be okay with it okay so my big promise by end this webinar is you're going to see how to quadruple your business by finding one simple email metric not a bunch of them not building some super complicated funnel okay I'm sure you guys have seen all the Ryan Dice funnels and I love Ryan Dice's marketing but we're not going to do anything that complicated okay though you can build stuff that complicated in about 10 minutes in market hero you can't build it anywhere else without pulling your hair out and throwing your cat through a window and I'm going to show you to get unlimited leads and 8x ROI. Now guys, how many people here would be cool if you just got like you could get like 5,000 leads a day at a 1x ROI? Meaning you just broke even. Like you just got a 5,000 leads a day, but you broke even and then you have this like a list of 5,000 people. Everyone's like me. And guys, what I'm going to do in this quest is this webinar is ask you just loaded question after loaded question because I'm very insecure and need to see yes in the chat box at least every 30 seconds. Now again guys, this is without any complicated funnels. This is without any large ad spends. This is without selling experience. You can actually be downright bad at selling and suck at it. I'll even show you the super low conversions that you can still use and get an ROI on this. Okay. So, my goal on this webinar is if you have a business to make scaling it to eight figures straightforward and easy. Maybe not eight figures. Let's just go for seven to high six figures in this webinar. Let's not get ridiculous. Okay. And if you're a beginner, I'm going to give you the simplest way to create a five figure per month business uh from scratch. And this is what I believe is the easiest, straightforward, is going to last forever way to build a business online. Now, if you stay till the end of this webinar, like I promised, you're going to get my increase CTR swipes. I'm going to show you some patterns that I use routinely in all my emails uh to get much higher CTR than most other people, much higher clickthrough rates. Also going to give you my 8x ROI funnel template, okay? You can go and use it right after this webinar if you want. And it's the literally the funnel I've been using for the past two years at SourceWave. Okay. How many people here? How many people here? Give me a one. If you got here from Source Wave, you just know me from SourceWave, an SEO guy. I guarantee if you were from Source Wave and you're on my email list, you went through this funnel. Okay? You went through this funnel almost guaranteed. Actually, you're probably still in that funnel. And I'm also going to give you my 80% optin rate template. And yes, I do have a template that has routinely got me 60 to 80% of optin rates. More often than not, about 60%, but that's still freaking amazing in most niches. And the bodybuilding niche, you got me 80% of optin rate. So, if you are ever getting into whey protein powder or workout shakers or just getting really tight six-pack abs, is going to work for you, too. So, why is this different? I'm sure you guys have heard a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and theory and stuff in webinars. This is not fluff. This is not theory. All right? I'm going to make this is all about math. This webinar is strictly math, not theory. What you can go and apply right after this. So, um, don't don't focus the whole entire time because if you miss some of the parts, you miss some of the explanations between the math. You're going to have a hard time piecing things together. So, first, I think everybody here knows who I am, so I'm not going to tell my life story and do that lame [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that people do in every webinar. We're like, "Here's me on a yacht. I used to be broke and homeless. Oh, and then then I bought a yacht and now I'm I'm amazing." Okay, I'm sure Andrew Fox is going to watch this webinar and give me the finger. Um, but if you don't know who I am, I'm the USA Today, national bestseller, a tech entrepreneur, I make software. Um, here's me on a car with a lightsaber and a Ferrari, so that you know I make money. Um, here's me on stage with people listening to me, so you know I'm semi-important. And here's me next to Grant Cardone, so that you know I network with cool people. Okay, there's all the value stacks you could ever want uh in in one webinar right there. So, a little bit of my background. I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen me from Source Wave and and the Alex Becker YouTube channel, that horrible place. Uh, but long story short, grew my first business, major business, Source Wave, to a little under $5 million per year. And I did most of this through 100% through direct response email marketing. In fact, almost all of it. Okay? I did not run an SEO agency back in the day, a smaller SEO agency. Um, I worked with local clients and stuff like that. I stopped taking clients and I grew Source Wave literally from the ground up using email marketing. In fact, you might have remembered I used to do a lot of launches. I don't do launches anymore because I know how to grow my business through email marketing. That's what you're going to see in this webinar. Uh, if you're relying on JV traffic, you're relying on other forms of traffic and begging and pleading people to give you traffic, that's going to set you free. Um, the thing I'm really good at, and a lot of people say, "Oh, you're really good at SEO and stuff like that." Like, I am good at SEO, but my true skill set is mathematically growing businesses. In less than a year, I was able to take my business from 1.5 to a little around $5 million per year using what you're going to see in this webinar, the growth metrics we're going to talk about. Um, and I help other businesses get the same growth. Actually, I don't really do that anymore. I don't talk to people. I don't take clients. I don't consult. I don't coach. I don't like doing that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay? I'm focused on my business. Um, and so these webinars are really the last time I'm ever really doing like coaching crap like that. You're going to see me open a coaching program next week. Um, so I've been doing this for a while. You guys know who I am. And basically my whole entire business comes down to getting leads for X and making a four to eight times ROI in it. Okay? So I've had a lot of success doing that. And this comes from doing things wrong. All right? By starting the slow lane with a no control business. Okay? Um, I'm not going to do the whole are you and only these pain points and stuff like that, but after doing this for a a long time, all right, a lot of people here, give me one. If you like you get your leads and you get your your customers and crap like that through JV stuff and you feel like you don't have any control of your business. Basically, you can't get leads on command. You can't go on Facebook tomorrow and get 5,000 leads and make it pay for itself. A lot of ones right here. Okay. How many people here? Give me two. if you're actually making money from your email marketing, but it's really hard to get your metrics and you're like putting like eight different solutions together and it's really frustrating and so you can't like really scale your business. Like you're making maybe $100,000 a million dollars a year, but you're having a lot of trouble scaling because you can't scale your business. Okay, so that's exactly where I was. Just a brief history so you guys can kind of relate. Um, for the longest time at SourceWave, I was stuck at around seven figures a year. Okay, I made like I think at my high point when I was doing willy-nilly, I hit about 2 million a year, then I went back to like 1.5 million a year and it was like a million a year and like just stuck around there. And the problem from that is because I was either stuck at getting my leads from JB launching, which was basically where you launch a product and you make a bunch of hype and you just make like the biggest, sleaziest sales page of all time and you launch and like billions of people jump into your software and everything breaks and everything goes wrong, but then you have like 30,000 leads at the end of the day that you can sell [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to. Okay, I'm sure. How many people are giving me an X for you doing that? Few people. Few people. It's not the most popular form, but long story short, I kept having to do that. I kept having to write like make videos and write and be blogging. How many give me an X if you're a blogger? You're blogger and you want more leads. Tons of bloggers. All right. So, I was stuck having to make good content. Uh do these JB things, beg people like feature me on their places cuz you know what? I couldn't go out there and I couldn't buy traffic. I couldn't grow my list without doing all these relying on other people to grow my list for me. Okay? And even when I was growing my list, it was so hard to grow with paid advertising because I always wanted super cheap traffic. How many people here? Give me a three. If traffic gets too expensive for you too fast, okay, a lot of people here, that was me, too. I'd start off with my traffic. Of course, when you start a Facebook ad campaign, you're getting like leads for 50 cents to a dollar. And I was like, "Oh, this is great. I'm going to skill this moon because I know I make more than a dollar per lead. I know I do." Okay, but then soon the leads start getting a little bit more dry and it gets up to3 to5 to $6 per lead and I'm like, "Oh crap, I can't compete more. I shut off my traffic. Like, this is too expensive." Okay, I just spent $1,800 a day. It's too much. That's too much money. I don't know what my metrics are. Okay, so I keep sending emails out. I keep being able to grow my business. But at the end of the day, I can never grow my business because I didn't know I was making a profit. I didn't know I was making a profit. Okay, but after doing this for 5 years, I found a way to get leads that and get them to get me an 8x ROI. Literally, I will pay an average right now about $4 to5 per lead and within about six months time, I'll make $22 back. It's neat. It's cool. Okay, this allows me to get unlimited leads without being anyone's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Okay, I don't have to ask anybody to promote me. I don't have to give away prizes. I don't have to go to Forbes and beg them to put my article on their site. I don't have to create really good, interesting blogging content that goes viral because I'll just turn on my freaking Facebook ads and give myself a thousand leads and they'll pay for themselves eight times over within six months. And I'm able to do this by getting a simple metric that allows me to ever sleep by leads and always make a huge ROI. Okay? And guys, look, I'm not doing anything complicated here. I use an email pattern that gets me an ROI. And I've been doing it for the past two years now. Okay? And what's really cool about this is you're going to be able to inject this in your business by the end of this webinar. And I promise we're going to get into content. I just want to let you guys know the backstory and how I figured this out and how I'm doing that. Okay? And you're going to be able to inject this in your business and make scaling simple because you're going to know a magic little metric that's going to let you scale to the moon. Okay? Um, and everybody here has already answered this question. How easy would it be if you knew you were making How many people here? If you made $10 per lead, would you be able to scale your business really fast? Give me one. If you're paying like two to five, most people are paying $2 to $3 per lead. Yeah. Be so easy. It'd be so easy if I was able to sit down with you and I was able to take your business aside and I was able to look at all your customers have bought in the past six months, everything they've done. I was able to sit down with you and go, um, you know, Greg, look, I actually did this with Greg the other I'm like, "Greg, look, um, I looked at your PayPal. I looked at your Stripe account. I looked at whatever your checkout process is, and every single lead that's coming into your list is making you $15 over 6 months." And you go, "Yeah, Alex, but I know, but I'm I'm paying $6 up front, and I'm going to the red." But I said, "Well, you know, you you go into the red at first, but in 6 months, you're making $15 back. You're making a $10 profit on every $6 lead." How many of you guys would be comfortable spending $1,000 a day on ads then? How easy would it be to scale your business? How excited would you be to scale your business? Wouldn't that be cool if you see if you saw leads coming in for $10 and you're like, "Holy crap, that's awesome." Like that's a really expensive lead cost, but you could still like like when I see a lead and I spend $10 on the lead, I still make like $12 profit on it. That's so cool. Like wouldn't that be so cool if you just turn your leads and know that? Well, that's what I'm going to show you to do. Okay. The goal of this webinar is you to be able to buy an email and get the massive ROI. When you're able to go out there and literally just get to a 2x point where you're making two times what you're getting on leads, your business explodes because you're no longer restricted. You have an unlimited traffic. Facebook AdWords, YouTube, solo ads, you have unlimited traffic. There's too much traffic for you. There's enough traffic to get you to eight figures, okay? But we're not going to get that. It all comes down to one metric, guys. And if I got this, I just go my niche as far as I could in my niche. And the problem, guys, the problem with SEO, the reason why I'm also making other software is SEO is too small. When I run Facebook ads, four out of six, four out of 10 people that opt in are already on my list. And then probably two of those other two that opt in are actually other emails that are already on my list. Okay, it's it's peaked. It's annoying. Okay, so I did just that. I got that metric. Well, source I was able to go out there and say, "Hey, look, you know, my long-term value the long-term value of my lead was $22 per lead." Boom. Over six months. And it took me getting a pay plan. It took me going out there and connecting uh this program called Improve. It took me Frankensteining it with Infusionoft and a lot of other stuff. I'm going to get into it. I had to get a $1,000 autoresponder upfront. Okay, now my autoresponder cost me like 2K a month. Okay. Um, and they overcharge the heck of me. I had to get a tracking program that cost me like a hundred bucks a month. I had to go out there and you guys know the the stuff. Okay, so look guys, the hard way to do this is, and this is exactly what I did. I went out there and got a, you know, infusionoft. It's $2,000 a month. I had to learn how to use inf. Has anybody here ever tried? Give me a three. If you've ever tried to go out there and and use infusion soft, these complicated softwares, and you know the potential, but you just never do it because it's such a pain in the ass. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, "Hey, dude, you can make these complicated funnels here. All you have to do is rip apart your entire cart system and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] everything. Come on. Oh, by the way, if you want me to teach you how to do it, you got to pay me a $1,200 co coaching fee cuz our software is so [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] confusing uh that uh you need me to sit down with you to actually explain it." That it's funny. Okay, but I had to buy a tracking program to do this. I had to lose money on ads trying to get the system right. Cuz look, I was good at running ads, but combining these two system together, my tracking always went off. To get my long-term value, my actual long-term value with all the tracking, I'd start up a program, I get like a thousand leads on, and go, "Oh, wait, the tracking cookie wasn't set the right way, or oh, that this thing wasn't set the right way or oh, this in infusionoft, the funnel wasn't built the right way." And then boom, had to start all the way over again because it was all like eight different systems that weren't talking to each other. Okay. Um, I had to test and test and test different email strategies to go out there and find this out. Um, and I literally spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars to get this metric and figure this all out because once I had that metric, you can just scale to the moon. Okay. But once I did have that metric, my business jumped from an unpredictable no control a lot of the things we're talking about this webinar a lot of people relating to million-dollar business to a $5 million business where I don't really have to do anything. It's shocking almost because the leads come in predictably and that's it. like and I run a webinar every Thursday with this business and this I'm going to show you the exact process to get this stuff. So, the easiest way to do this um let me just get straight into it because I just go getting ahead of myself getting all excited. Everybody give me a two if you think this is cool. Like you're excited, get into it. I'm getting you pumped up. All right, getting giving you a big old marketing boner. Now, how many people here want an easy way does not involve tens of thousands of dollars spent on software? Literally, I've spent tens of thousands of dollars on software. Like, just to go out there and get any of these complicated software I've mentioned so far will cost you like $10,000 a year, even if you're just starting out. Like, come on. All right. Uh, this is Who wants the easy way without hundreds of hours of working and figuring out software? How many How many people here, you know, don't want to spend tens of thousands of dollars testing ads and email strategy? You just want the answer. How many people here, how would it how much would it change your life if you could go out there, increase your LTV, and get the 8x ROI on leads? And I think everybody here can agree. I'm asking those loaded questions again, but just give me one final exclamation mark. If it would change your life if you just had one that one LTV metric that told you, hey, you're getting a 3 to 4x lead return every six months. Okay, cool. Boners. Buck yes. I love it. All right, we're just getting nasty in this webinar. All right, this will never be used as an auto webinar ever because we will piss off everyone that watches it. Okay, so I think I've talked about enough, guys. this five that's my business from $2,500 a day to $1,200,000 a day gave me the big point of this guys is control. That's what you're going to get out of this webinar is control because you can go out there and you control your lead flow. You can control how much you're making and what you're going to see what you're able to do with market hero is you're going to be able to actually adjust stuff and see what makes you more money and your long-term value. It's going to change your [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] life. Um so there we go. So real talk real quick guys. Obviously, by watching this webinar, you're not going to 5x your business overnight. You might, you actually could. The information here, you can do it with actually this information right here allowed me to 5x my business, but I don't know you. I don't know your business. I don't know how smart you are, what you're going to do, or if you're high on drugs right now watching this webinar. Everything's out of my control, so I don't know. So, just quick warning right there. All right. So, there's three catalysts. This is how you do it. I'm going to show you how to get your numbers that let you scale endlessly in a few minutes. Remember guys, it took me like months to go out there and set up a system that would actually work and get me my like LTV. It I didn't get it right right away, like the system. And it actually took me like a few months actually just to get the system right. So then I could start calculating my LTV and it was still off because the systems don't track with every email you click. Okay, so it was still off as hell. I probably make like close to $30 to $40 per lead, but my tracking system sucks so much um that that's what happened. All right. Then I'm going to show you the three-step way or three-step power and I follow with your leads to get massive LTV ROI on every single lead that comes in. I'm going to show you the exact email strategy. I'm actually going to show you the exact funnel. Okay? And it's going to be shockingly simple. Okay? Um just quick show of hands, give me an exclamation mark. If you've ever seen like those super complicated funnels the marketing gurus show you and they're like, "All right, so you do this and it's like confusing as hell and you're like, "How could I ever build that? That that looks like a Tyrannosaurus Rex. You just designed Megatron. That's neat. But no. All right. You're going to be able to do that in this webinar. All right. I'm going to show you to combine these together to get literally unlimited leads from Facebook Adwords and all sorts of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that by asking one simple question. Even in competitive markets, I'm going to show you to bully your competitors out. Bully your competitors out of the markets. Okay? There's nobody that can. There might be one company. I don't know if Moz can spend more per lead than I can. It depends because they have a longer I don't know. But you I can bully almost 90% of my competitors out there. You actually seen what's really funny is you've been watching Sorcery over the Furious. How many people have ever seen that um 524 niches ad? Give me one if you ever seen that on Facebook. Yeah. Like tons of ones. Okay. And I there's been so many people that have copied that exact ad and landing page. So many people. And you know what happens? Their ad goes offline in a week because they realize, oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the leads aren't coming in super cheap. Becker's paying like $4 to5 per lead and he doesn't care. and they can't they don't they don't know to get a $22 ROI away from their fun. They don't know long-term marketing. They're just I love them. My competitors are great people, but they're just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] marketers who don't know how to play the long-term game and they're not doing what I'm going to show you in this webinar. So, that's why they can copy my exact ads and they still can't beat me. Okay. So, how do you get your growth metrics that make scaling your business easy mode in minutes, aka long-term value? Okay. Um and and what's this metric? What's this one magic metric that we've talked about so far? LTV. And that's the average long-term value you get per email. And that's the total amount of money you make on average per email over at ends of time. You can actually track this for two years if you want. Okay? But I usually stop at 6 months. I usually make my money back on the first month and then some. Um then two months I usually make about 1.5 my money back. And then as we get going and we have more high ticket offers, I'll make about, you know, that's when we start really really making the money back. um you know, four to four, five to sixx times. Okay. So, how easy would it be if your LTV was $22 after six months? If you could go out there, literally all you'd have to do if you could go out there and get the same LTV that I'm getting, you can spend less than $22 and make unlimited income. As long as the lead's coming in for less than $22, you just have unlimited leads. That's what I do. Okay. Now, all it takes is right now if you don't have Market Hero, all it takes is just sticking just taking the grapefruit, okay, covering in sandpaper and shoving it in your mouth. Your mouth. We weren't going to go that direction, guys. But it's it's painful and it's awful. Um, accurately tracking every action that your person This is what it takes. It takes you going out there and every single time a person ops in, tagging them with a cookie and tracking everything they do over six months. Now, keep in mind, guys, people clear their cookies like crazy. How many people here? Give me a three if you cleared your cookies today. A lot of threes. I clear my cookies every day. Okay. So, it's really hard to keep track of your customers and track every move they're doing, especially even if you're IP tracking. People are changing their IPs and stuff like that. The only way to consistently really track people is to constantly be tagging them every single time they click your email. But you can't do that. But if you want to go out there and get your ELTV, you have to go out there and accurately track every action a person does, everything they do after they buy your list. Now, how did I do that? Well, I had infusionoft. Okay. But, uh, I already had an existing cart system, so I didn't want to rip apart my cart system. Um, and I had to use a system called Improvely, and basically when a person opted in, I'd send through that link, and that was the only time they were cookied ever. And then they have to watch and beg and see what they were buying over like a six months time. And by about 3 months, everybody's cookies started slowly disappearing. my numbers stopped getting a lot more accurate. Okay, so it's not impossible anymore. You guys, would you guys like to do this? Would you like to go out there and get your numbers today? Tonight? Okay, would you like to go out there and start collecting your numbers and data tonight? Give me one. Yes. Okay, I'm going to show you how freaking freaking easy it is. Okay, so look, let me hop over to Mark here. so here's what you do. All right, let me load up. Let my products load up real quick. All right. So, you can see right here we got Source Wave SEO right here. All right. So, here's step one. Okay. You go right here. We got Source Uni right here. Okay. Grab your cookie. Okay. Now, how many of you here give me a three if you're confident enough to paste a cookie on your thing or post a uh pixel on your thank you page? Give me a three if you're confident enough to do that. Okay. Good. All right. Your tracking setup. You're done. You're done. That's it. Okay. So, I've of course gone and posted this on Source Uni. Okay. So, what I want to do right here is here's an example funnel right here. All right. Actually, this is a funnel that I ran just to get a few leads in to kind of show you how it works. You can see right here. Put in about 30 people, 31 people in here. Now, when people go through this funnel, guys, there's there's hit with an email. All right. The first email right here offers them source union. Of course, they're offered it right after they opt in. So, when they opt in, tag is applied right here. We also apply a tag right here that identifies them as unique funnel. So I know exactly where they came in. So I can go over here in my leads and say, "All right, so every person that came through this funnel right here." Good. Two seconds. I have a ton of leads to load up. Um, every person that came through this funnel right here. Okay, you can see exactly how all the people that just jumped in. I can go right here and I can generate the LTV. Okay, there we go. They're worth $484 so far. so far. Okay. But say guys, like let's say if I check back six months later, I have all those cookies on my thank you pages and anytime a person clicks an email in Market Hero, this LTV is just going to start going up and up and up because I'm tracking every single thing these 31 people are doing. It could also be 30,000, by the way. It doesn't matter. It could be 100,000. It's the same exact thing. Give an exclamation mark if that's pretty cool if you're kind of seeing where I'm coming with this. Yeah, it's pretty neat. Okay, I know I now have this number that took me months to get. Um, and with a copy and paste that that's it. So, anyways, people come through this stream. Let's just imagine this stream right here. All right, let me show you the automation. We're doing some crazy Ryan Dice automation right here, guys. All right, it's going to get nuts. Okay, so person comes here and they get applied with the tag uni funnel. Okay, so what happens is, of course, here's a follow-up email and they get sent to an uni offer. Okay, now here's what happens, guys. It's really cool. If they buy Source Uni, not only does that pixel that tells me that they bought something work as a tracking pixel, it also works as a trigger. So if they buy something, guess what? The funnel's over. They go to a thank you email, get sent into the rest of the funnel. They get sent somewhere else. I can actually have them get sent to another product and be upsold. I could actually go and upsell them three other products. Okay? But if they don't buy it, guess what happens after a day? Get another uni followup. Okay? A lot of people haven't gotten to that point. right here. We had one person buy out of the 31 that came in. Uh, from advertising, my earning per lead is already $4.84 because I know how many people here are like, "Wait, Uni is a $47 program." Give me give me a question mark. If you're like, "Wait, how's that happen?" Yeah. Okay. Uni on average, people stay for three and a half months. So, I put $150 the value, guys. It's all about that long-term value. That's why everything at Source Waves reoccurring. You know, at Source CCS, the package of a program, it's about $67. Usually, people pay say for six months. That's like a $300 sale every single time they come in. Okay. Give me that. Give me an exclamation mark if you have like an aha moment, too, with all your reoccurring projects and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Yeah. Okay. Um, so person comes in right here. If they don't hit the pixel right here, guess what happens? They get sent a free trial. So, I'm I'm marketing them based on what they're doing. And finally, if they don't hit the free trial, we kick them out of the funnel. We could actually send them somewhere else. We could send some more content to get them involved. We can do all sorts of stuff like that. Um, and then what happens when they do hit the pixel? They get a uni thank you. You know how long this took me to set up? Actually, I'll I'll I can build the exact funnel right in front of you in 10 seconds. Okay. Not going to go write the email. So, I can go right here. Apply tag. We can go tag here. I'm going to talk like an ewok for the rest of the webinar. All right. We can go right there. We can set up and actually if we want to, we can actually go build an optin. We can have an image, whatever. And then what happens when you come down a form will appear. We can go and get rid of the name and all sorts of stuff like that. Also guys, our optin forms are completely integrable with any other optin form software. How many people use your own optin form software? Give me one if that's you. You don't like I could have the best optins ever and you still want to use them. Yeah, you can go and you can just take the HTML code and plop it in um right over there and you can just plop it into your autoresponder. I mean your your optin, okay? And you're good to go. Okay, but you can also go build your own optin right here in here. You can create your own form. It will look a lot like this when it comes through. Boom. Pop down. We can do the whole entire marketing thing right there. And we're going to make this a lot prettier, too. So, um, got to remember this is day one. This is day one. What we have in a month, it's going to be insane. We're in this thing called the start action. Um, that's going to blow your mind. Okay. Um, people will be able to like you'll be able to trigger your marketing by people viewing pages and people will like if they go to one page and another, they'll get like a different upsell and it's going to be really cool. So, I can go right here and I can set this funnel right here. Um, I'll apply the tag. Where is it? Unifunnel. I already did that. All right. So, I have an email sequence right there. Go to another action right here. Conversion pixels hit. Boom. And I don't have to go place any other pixels. The pixels already placed, guys. So, I'll go right here and I'll do uh let's just do source. Let's just do source hunter for this one. Okay. Boom. Boom. Boom. No. Yes. Isn't that cool? If I can actually land it on there. Give me Give me a three if that's pretty cool. took two seconds. Yeah. And all I have to do, I can go in here. All I have to do right here is I can go write some nice little pretty emails. Simple email builder. Go through. We can change all the the the gizmos and gizmos and change the heading style. And it's all set right here. I can change the width and the freaking image size right here. We can go change the image if you want. You can also send pictures of Market Hero uh in the bottom of every email you send. We have it preset to that. So, if you want to send that out. But there you go. But guys, how many people here give me an estimation park if you already know how to get your long-term value? Now, that's how you do it. You you go right here, you go to products, you paste the pixel, and then you send emails. In fact, guys, any email you send out, it's going to start totaling up. It's going to start totaling up over time, and you're going to start seeing the long-term value. Now, what I do right here at Source Wave, I just imported the the paid funnel marketing right here, is I go through and I track everybody that comes in. When a person comes in right here, they're tagged with a tag called source wave new. Okay? And I'm able to see in the future, 6 months from now, I'm able to see the 100 people that opt in this week exactly how much they were worth to me over six months. And let me go back and say, "Oh, wow. They were worth $12. They were worth $22." Pretty easy, right? Give me three if that's pretty easy. That changes your business overnight. Suddenly, Suddenly, instead of me going out there and going, "Man, I really hope my ads are paying off and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. I don't know if I can buy this traffic." I can just go and go, "Hm." All right. All right, so we ran that ad and we were paying like $6 per lead, you know. Um, but we can see right here right off the bat, we got $4.84 back per lead. But then I can come back a week later, two weeks later, a month later and go, "Oh, wow. We're at $8 per lead." I come back three months later and go, "Oh, wow. We're at $10 per lead. Oh, wow. We're at $15 lead. Dude, David, that's one of my ad guys." I'm like, "Dude, buy us more [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ads right now. Just if it's less than $10, just go." And that that's what we do. That's Source Wave. That's how I make millions of dollars. That's it. You see how easy that is? Give me an exclamation if you see that's pretty easy. Pretty easy. A lot of exclamation marks. Someone says I'm confused. That's okay because I've just blown your mind. Okay. I see a lot of exclamation marks. Just follow around because I'll tell jokes and stuff. You don't even have to listen. Okay. So, getting this end all number is now simple. It's copy and paste. It's copy and paste. Literally, you don't have to change your card. It's it's actually copy and paste. People say it all the time in webinars. You just go and copy that tracking pixel. you place on your page and it works as a trigger trigger and an uh tracking pixel. There you go. So, Calis 2 guys, I'm gonna show you the three-step email pattern easily gets me massive ROIs. It's going to blow your mind. It's so simple. Okay, so I know what you're thinking. How many people think that funnel and everything and that ROI that that ROI I just showed you that's great, but like there's no way you're going to get that same ROI. Give me one if that's you. be like, "Alex, that's great, but my copywriting sucks. I can't sell my way out of a paper box. I have bad conversions. I have bad conversions, Alex. I suck." Okay, a lot of people here like, "I don't have bad conversions. I'm so smart." I'm like, "Okay, great, man. That's that's cool." All right, just bear with me. Bear with me. Put your e pener away. All right, so wrong. Look, guys. I've tried all sorts of complicated funnels out there to get ROIs. They work if you if you do them right, but not as well as what I'm going to show you. This is This is easy. It's really easy, especially when you can look back six months later and be like, "Oh, wait. All this time I've been making like $25 per lead and I've been afraid to buy ads." So, here's my adex funnel, guys. I'm actually going to take you inside Market Hero and show you how I automate this in clever ways. Um, but let's get into it. So, a lot of people have been through this funnel already. Person opts in, they get a welcome video. Now, guys, you have to understand the thing about me. How many people here wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't care if they don't make their money upfront? if they make their money back six times over in six months. Give me one if that's you. That's me, too. Okay. So, what I found, guys, is you can sell up front, but it actually lowers the amount of money you're going to make in the long run. Okay? Does that make sense? Because look, how many people have heard that buyers the buyers and freebie chaser theory? Give me a three if you've heard that. Buyers versus some people listen are just freebie chasers. They never buy anything. Guys, every person in the United States has bought something on Amazon. Every person online is a buyer. There's no such thing as a person that uses the internet and doesn't buy stuff. It's not. It's no, it does not freaking exist. The difference between a buyer and a freebie chaser is a buyer has had time to get to know you and your product and develop a rapport with you. That's it. Okay? Maybe they're a little bit more inclined to buy internet marketing products or whatever the heck you're slinging. That's it. If you get a person to have rapport and trust with you, they're going to buy just like a buyer. They're going to buy just like a buyer, and you won't even have to be good at pitching it, guys. I've rolled up webinars at SourceWave, had an awful pitch and closed almost $90,000 in reoccurring income in a single evening without a without anything. I just like, "This works. Would you like to buy it?" And people are like, "Yeah, sure." Okay, you don't have that that it's not true in my experience. Okay, so that has nothing to do with it, though. Here's my funnel. Person option, I send them a welcome video. What am I doing this welcome video? I'm welcoming the source wave. I'm telling them who I am, telling them what they're going to get and that we're going to send them cool stuff and we're not going to screw around with them. All right? And we deliver value first. Why? Because I'm building that rapport. Second email they get, they get value. But also, guys, if you notice at my end of all of our videos, we mention Source University. So, we actually close a lot of sales from our value videos. Send another Va email. Value. Third email you get from us if you've opened these two is a pitch for Source Hunter. It's a low low ticket product. It's like 9 to 19 bucks a month. Actually, I think it's like 37 now or something. But it's a really low ticket offer that all SEOs need. It's very not intimidating. It doesn't burn any bridges when people see it. They're like, "Oh, cool. He also has this cool software tool. That's neat." All right. So, value value. Send another pitch for Source University. Okay. It's 47. Actually, it's 67 a month now. Um, but we give them a ton of value. Nave, I've been hearing about Source University for four emails now at the end of every email. Can you give me a type in five if you can kind of see why they're kind of more inclined to buy Source University now? And guys, Source University at $67 isn't a $607 sale for me. It's closer to $180 to $240 because I think we've increased the the time people spend on there now. It's a huge sale. It's a huge sale. The tracking gets that, okay? Because I know because I've looked at my PayPal, I know exactly how much it's worth. So, I just put that number as my tracking earnings from that. Okay? So, then what happens, guys, that we send two more value emails and then we send something high ticket. It might be OMG. It might be um one of our services. It might be something that's a,000 bucks a month. It might be something that's a $2,000 product at this time point in time, guys. The whole point of this process right here, yeah, we close some money right here. We close some money right here. Is to get one person or two people to buy that high ticket. Okay? Because if one person buys, if one of 2,000 people that opt in, buy a $5,000 product, the ROI is huge. The ROI is huge. How many people here think you could get one person if you got them on the phone out of 2,000 people if you gave them value and teach taught them and built their trust. You can get one person to buy a $5,000 product from you. One out of 2,000. Give me one. If you think you could do that without even being good at selling, just go pick up a Grant Cardone book. There you go. Okay. So, here's exactly how I make this huge ROI, guys. I follow this exact problem. Um, and what do I have right here is horrendous conversions. This is if you suck at selling and like your sales videos start with you mooning them. Okay, I've never started a sales video with me mooning people, but just listen up. All right, so let's imagine 15 people buy a $150 product right here. Okay, that's $2,500 back. And let's actually kick this up to $4 per lead. We spent $8,000. Okay, and this is about the first two weeks when a person comes in. So we made $2,200 back right off the bat right there. Okay, so then 20 people buy an $80 product. We made 1,600. So we're at like almost 3,000 back right now. Okay, then one person buys a $5,000 product and this is what it all leads up to. Okay, and if you really want to kill it, guys, the problem with Source Wave, guys, is I don't really go for the kill. All right, I don't sell uh $10,000 products. I don't sell $25,000 products. I have friends that their funnel goes from a $5,000 product to a $10,000 product to a $25,000 product. For example, I got on Russell Brunson's funnel and I joined his high ticket mastermind for $25,000. It goes up and up. All right. I just don't go for the kill like that at Sourceway because um I'm busy building stuff like this. This is what I like to do. Okay. But you can see right here, guys, even with these horrible conversions, we made our money back even if the lead cost is really expensive. And what happens after that, guys, is every lead, every one of these 2,000 leads is free money till the end of time. Give me an exclamation mark. That's pretty cool. If you give me one if you see how easy it is, even if you have really bad conversions. So, you don't have to be an expert at selling. I'm not up here saying, "Well, you get a 5% conversion right here. You get a 6% conversion right here. And you get a 3% conversion on the $5,000." No, this is like 015. This one's like 02. And this one right here is like 0.0000. I can't even do the math. All right, there you go. So, do the math, guys. Even if you're horrible, you can still get an ROI doing this. But the whole key of it, guys, is knowing you're getting an ROI. No one knows they're getting an ROI. They're just like, "Oh crap, I didn't make money on the first ad. Guess I'm effed. I'm screwed. So, how do we do this in Market Hero? All right, let me walk you through the process in Market Hero. Let me actually walk you through the exact funnel I'm using right now. We cloned it over to this account. This is like the sort of demo account, but you can see right here what's going on. Let me walk you through the funnel I built. And give me a three if you want to see like a really really complicated funnel, like one crazy Ryan Dice funnel before we get in into the next part. Okay, we'll get into that right after this. This is a simple funnel. Okay. I know. Give me an exclamation mark if you think this looks complicated. Yeah. Okay. I can I can see right here. It looks complicated. It's really simple. Trust me. All right. I'll walk you through it step by step. Person opts in. They see they see a thank you page. Okay. They have a tag applied to them called source wave new. This is my exact business, guys. This is my exact business. I don't do anything else but this. This has been my in infusionoft. This same funnel is over there, but I can't track its earnings. I can't do any of the stuff I've talked about or showed you in Sweetber. I can't actually in infusion stuff I can't sort by when a person buys or not without ripping apart my cart. So the stuff I'm doing this funnel I couldn't do in infusion but this is the exact same pattern. Okay. So a person comes in sort by tags applies tag right here that their source wave new. They get an email. Okay. If they open the email it they waits three days sends them another email. If they don't open the email it sends an email again. It says hey man you missed this. Okay. Wait a day sends the next email. Okay. It does that pattern over and over again. If they go, it sends them another email. If they click the email, it takes them to the next email. If they don't click the email, it rem, say, "Hey, man, you didn't click the email. You want you get this value content." Why is it important for people to open my value emails? Because they need to trust me and they need to have rapport with me and they need to like source wave. They need to like my business. They need to actually know when I send them stuff, it's going to be really good stuff. Okay. So, then right here, person comes in again. Boom. Hunter pitch. But here's where it gets more fun. Pixels on Hunter. So, if they buy Hunter, it sends them the next email. If they don't buy Hunter, hit them with a completely different angle and pitch. Give me a three if you think that's pretty cool, right? It's really simple. There you go. All right. And same pattern goes over and over again, guys. Get on Hunter. And some people say this overhead. Don't worry, guys. When you get inside, there's there's a little question mark inside of every area that shows you exactly how everything does works and and does it. And there's training videos and everything. Um, and actually, you guys will have the chance to actually have me teach you everything as well. We'll get into that later. Um, so again, right here, same exact pattern. Value if they open it, moves them on. If they don't open it, sends them again. Value. If they open it, moves them on. If they don't open it, sends it again. Finally, source university. Boom. If they buy it, apply tags. They're source wave old. You get a tag right here. You're an actual source wave member. And guys, when a person comes in, I don't want them getting all my normal emails. So, what it does right here, it tags them with source wave old so that I'm always blasting the source wave old members. I'm not blasting, but I send value and you get put into a different funnel where it's handled through broadcast and I handle manually. But this point in time, you get put into the big big list. Okay? At this point in time, I don't interrupt you. I put you through the little nurturing process. Okay? So then end of it, you get an offer for Source Uni. If you buy it, you move on. You stop. You get kicked out of this this funnel and moved into another one. If you don't buy it, you get offered a free trial. There's a there's the secret for you guys. You get this funnel. Don't buy Uni the first time we offer it. Wait for the free trial. Someone said, "Where do I sign up?" Wait, guys. You can you can't buy Market Hero yet. Let me show you another funnel real quick before we get into it, guys. Um, where's the immediate base? Yeah, this one. This one's a lot of fun. Okay, so this is fun. This is how you do a three upsell funnel if you want to get really complicated. Now, guys, if you're simple, if you want to keep it simple, you can literally just do a delay and simple email where you just like, "Hey, email delay email." Oops. That's There you go. And you can just build like a straight up funnel that you would build in any other's tool like this. Super simple. Okay, but what we got going on right here, person comes in, tag is applied. They came in through this funnel. So, we know where they came from and what traffic source they came from. And guys, if you're a beginner, this is not a type of funnel you're going to be building. But if you're a person that builds a lot of funnels, give me give me an exclamation mark if you're a person that builds a lot of funnels. Give me give me an X if you have like a boner right now because you understand what I'm doing. Okay, cool. This is for the advanced people. Okay, going to zoom in a little bit. And here's another thing that you can do in this funnel builder. You can't do infusionoft. You can zoom in and out. Someone said, "I'm confused, guys. This isn't your typical make money webinar. This is advanced marketing, okay? But you can zoom in and out and you can like build farther and it like expands. It's crazy. It's another thing you can't do." Um, anyways, so person opts in, they get sent the first email and I'm going to walk you through it if they buy everything right away. All right. If they buy, yes. All right. So, they sent to another one. They're sent an upsell immediately after it. Okay, cool. All right. So, they might they're sent to another pixel right here immediately after. So, then they've been sent to the upsell. So, it waits a second to see if they bought it again. Okay. If they do buy it, boom, sent to another pixel. They're sent to the third upsell because what happens on that landing page? Boom. They're sent to another upsell right here. If they buy, if they buy it again, boom, they're taken out of the funnel and taken to a welcome email. Okay. Let's imagine if they come right here and they don't buy. So, email sequence one. No, they don't buy. All right, so boom. No, they get sent another follow-up email. If the pixels hit again, yes, they're taken to another pixel. Straight through the process again. Okay, if they don't buy, taken again, taken to a welcome email because they're not interested. They're kicked to another part of the funnel. Okay, boom. If they go to the second upsell, they don't buy, email sequence, another pixel. They don't buy again, email sequence following up, another pixel. They don't buy again, boom, sent here, sent to the next offer or sent to the welcome email. All right, give me a three. If you you're an advanced funnel building, you kind of get what I'm getting at right there. We're actually going to in the training process, I actually break this funnel down step by step by step. You can actually have it import into your account. Give me a three if you c you kind of catch my drift. Cool. Awesome. A lot of threes. I love it, guys. All right. Really makes me happy that some uh more advanced people do this. So, guys, let's wrap this all together. How do we get rich doing this? Give me a question mark. If you're like, how how do how do this is cool. I can get my LTV. Where do how where do we A lot of question marks. All right. A lot of question marks. I don't like leaving you guys hanging. So catalyst number three. How do we combine these together to get unlimited higher ROI leads in even a competitive market and bully our competitors? Bully them. It's easy. It's really easy guys. You want to know how? Give me an exclamation mark if you want to know how I can take my business on Facebook right now and buy a thousand leads and you want to know the only question I need to ask. So easy. Let me let me show you. This is how I scale my business to a bazillion dollars. Okay. Sec. Oh, never mind. That's just a package. All right. Oops. Wrong wrong dashboard right there. All right. Here it is, guys. It's absolutely nuts. All I do is I go in here and I go right here and let's say I'm just doing this funnel right here, UniFunnel. All right, I got my guys right here. I go generate LTV and I go to any ad source. I go to Facebook. I go to YouTube. I go to AdWords and I say I can I can do this myself or I can get my ad guy say, "Can I get leads for less than $4.84? This is how much I make up front." Now, maybe two weeks later, guys, 3 weeks later, I come back and I say, "What do I what do I ask again?" Let's say this number right here is $8. What do I ask my ad guy if we're going to try a traffic source out? What do I ask my ad guy if it's if it says $8 right here? If I want to know if I can break into a traffic source or not, can I get leads for less than my LTV? Hopefully, I can get at this point in time. I can get leads for $5 anywhere. YouTube, Adwords, solo ads, solo ads, I can get them really cheap. Okay, really, really, really cheap. Um, YouTube, if you use it the right way, you can get them really cheap. Facebook, I can get leads for three to four dollars usually right now because a really good ad guy. Adwords, I can get leads for $5 right there. Man, if it's coming in here $8 in the first month, I'm rolling in money. I'm printing cash. I have unlimited leads. That's my business. All of it. You saw my funnel. You saw I get my number. And when I think about buying traffic, guys, I'm not out there doing all the advanced [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that people are doing. Um, and frankly, guys, when it comes when you get really deep into your niche, you're only going to be able to get leads. so cheap. Eventually, you run out of little loopholes and crap like that. When you start trying to get mass leads, you're going to have to bite the bullet and you're going to have to be able to pay more than your competitors for leads. That's just how it is with this. This is how I do it because my competitors are trying to find leads where they make money right away because they don't want to go into the red. They're inexperienced marketers. They don't know any of that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Okay? Me on the other hand, I laugh at $5 leads. I'm like, "Ha, six. Why not seven? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. Let's just spend $5,000 a day cuz I know it's coming back in the form of $22. At least $8. And you can see right there just from that one right there. You know, give me a give me an exclamation mark of that made your business really simple. It's really simple. super duper simple. Okay, so guys, at this point in time when I'm looking at a traffic source, if I can get the leads for less than my one month LTV, that's what I look at. All right, my one month LTV at SourceWave is about $6. That's because I don't sell right away. Okay, you saw on that funnel right there, I made about $484 back. And I will probably get down to about $3. I'm not even 3 to 250. Okay. Um because usually my freshest people hop into ads first. Uh or actually people that know my brand hopping through the ads because a lot of people know the Sourceway brand. That being said, guys, usually about the first month, I make about $6 back. Okay? So if I'm paying $4 to $5 per lead, I'm making about a dollar back in the first month. But after that first month, guys, it's unlimited money. It's just it's unlimited. I can mail that list for essentially free. Not essentially free because I have to actually I don't have to pay for my autoresponder anymore because I have one. Um but that's nice. Uh save myself $24,000 a year. It's pretty cool. I didn't even think about that till now. But that's it, guys. Oops. One sec. Oh, a little thing fell on my watch. But that's it, guys. And so all I do at that point in time is say, "Look guys, look, David, um, I want to get into AdWords. Can we get leads for less than $5?" He goes, "Let me go test." And we say, "Oh, we're getting leads for $4. All right. Give me as many leads as you can. I want as many as we can get in a day at $4." Okay? And the more and more leads you buy, it's going to start bumping up a little bit. So, you usually have to keep it down low or count and keep it at a a solid point. At that point in time, it's unlimited traffic, unlimited business, and after that first month, it's unlimited free money. Okay? Give me a three if that's really cool to you. That's my entire business. That's all I do. That's how that's the difference between my business making a million dollars a year, making five million. Okay? So, imagine what you could do with all this, guys. Imagine if you had your LTV from each traffic source. By the way, guys, I know exactly what traffic source, how much I'm making from it. Okay, I'm starting to get that with Market Hero. It was a little bit difficult with Improve because it was such a pain in the insane ass. But with Market Hero, it's really easy because I just have a different funnel. Or what I can do, guys, if I want to go and actually just see what traffic source they came from, what I do is I'll just go over here to the stream. Okay, I'll go create a new stream. Um, and so what we do is I'm going to have an optin right here. Optin right here for Google. This one's for Facebook. Okay, and when a person comes in, all I do is apply a different tag. All right, and I can send the exact same funnel. Okay, so boom. Apply Facebook tag right there. Apply the Google tag right there. Boom. Shoot them all right there. Boom. I can see exactly what traffic source is paying off and what traffic source isn't. Give an exclamation mark. That's pretty cool. Someone said, "How's this funnel work with affiliate offers?" It's really easy, guys. You just have your affiliates put your uh tracking cookie on their their thank you page. Every affiliate will do it for you. It's it's very common practice. It's extremely common practice to put tracking on affiliate stuff, especially if your affiliates want you to do well on what you do because then you make them money. So look guys, if you had this, imagine what you could do. You could buy unlimited leads for less than they make you effort effortlessly. I don't even monitor my traffic anymore. I jump in. I say, "David, what's the lead cost? What's the CPL?" He goes, "450." I go, "Great. Bye. That's it. That's that's how I manage my traffic because it's that easy." How many people here give me one if you'd be comfortable buying an ad guy? If you knew if you if you knew that, like you can just go and be like, "All right, how much does it cost?" One. Yeah. It makes buying an ad guy and not managing my traffic really easy. I don't have to be a Facebook expert. I just have to know how much I'm making in the long run. Okay, imagine if you had to rely on no one. You can control your business. Imagine if you could get rid of all the inaccurate tools and get back to focusing on growing your business. How many people here? Give me a three. If you spend more time dinking with tools than you do actually growing your business and trying you spend time trying to get tools to work. Yeah. Okay. Um, imagine how point blank easy it would be to like 5x your business when you operate like this. It was easy for me. It wasn't I'm not doing anything that different. In fact, my business is kind of dumber. I don't have to launch every two months. I don't have to go and talk to JBs. I don't have to network. I can sit in my house, let David run the ads, send people through these funnels, and do a webinar every Thursday. It's that easy. Okay. So, the result, guys, if you had all this is a straightforward, measurable path to seven to eight figures. Am I saying you're going to make seven to eight figures? You could if you go and apply this. This is what big businesses do. Okay? But this is how you go out there and this is how you print money online. Okay? So, for the past hour, would you agree this changes how you view your business? Give me a one if you agree with me. This changes how you look at your business. Okay, look. In an hour, I I could talk about this for days, guys. Like, I could sit here and I could break down the funnels and the actual email strategies and the copywriting and the offers I'm picking and the email funnels and I could do this for next eight hours, guys. But that's I'm not going to do that because I I don't want to sit here for eight hours straight forward with you. Okay? So, look, I have an offer to let you get Market Hero for free. For free. Okay? I don't want to I don't want to sell this to you guys if you don't want. But give me a three if you want to hear about it.

VIDEO ID: CiZb_PwuJDI

================================================================================

all right guys welcome to another training video you need to help so i'm here to help you so what we're going to work on right now is the broadcast i'm going to show you how to use this now like everything else in the system it's extremely simple but you can go very very deep with it so i'm going to show you uh how to do that so basic very basic email sending system right here from the get go you want to set your from name and your address is going to be coming from okay also be sure to check out the spf video that's provided in the original training area as well so with that being said how this works is almost the same exact way as the lead system okay so i can go right here and if i want to send just a basic email to everybody that has the tag source wave and that's how we segment our users we can do that now we can do a lot of other cool things with advanced settings just like in the leads area we can have it say all right we want everybody that has a tag source wave but does not have the tag alex becker okay so i don't want people from this list getting the same email so we can do that you can see how it reduces the amount of people on there so it subtracts 5000 people that have uh that specific tag and we can just go as deep as we want we can do anybody that has this tag uh for example we do anybody who has a sorcery tag but has bought uh this product right here add that right there and you can see you know it subtracts it from there so i can go and target people that haven't bought a proc i can target people that haven't seen a certain page target people that have been on the list for a certain amount of time it just goes on and on and on and on and on so i'm just gonna send a basic email right here and we're gonna go to email sequence so what you can do right here is you can create a new email you can use a template use template you can simply go right here you can see all the emails you previously sent you can select one of them and uh boom it's there you can go and edit the template change the uh the title the subject of the email the text the email it's all here for you to use pretty simple now um if you need any help other than this about the the the email builder it's very simple just drag and drop you can put your text right here you know write it all up and stuff like that you can go and change you can put an image right there you can go select your image just click it add the image to it um and you can do just about anything now if you want to control the styles how the email looks and everything we can go right here to change the overall uh style the email we can change it to whatever we want whatever we want to do and finally the last thing you might get confused with is the image you can go add an image right here i'm just going to go grab an image that we usually use let's just go and grab that image you see it loads up you can change the link right there if you want and they go and change the size of our image we go out here to block style and we just go like that so we can change it as much as we want we can change the padding around the image everything is super customizable as you can see we can change the body color of the the email it's all here okay anything you need in an email center to send simple emails is there and if you want to make it beautiful and pretty and stuff there's all the tools you need to do that as well you can add bigger images and whatever you need to do okay fairly simple so i'm going to cancel not going to save that um and that's really all there is to it we can create a new email it's essentially the same exact thing just make sure you have your unsubscribe uh your abuse link right here and your address you can go and actually add these by going right here and going to links and you can go and add any of these things right here you can add them in any way you want i like this this comes loaded in every template because it's very subtle and very low there but i know some people want to custom unsubscribe and review spine now you need to understand also with the report abuse button the cool thing about this is it's not going to count as a complaint against your account we will simply see it and see that somebody's complaining but this prevents people from actually complaining and damaging your account so keep that in mind now that's how that all works this is how the email center works at this point in time all we do is click send after naming the broadcast so we can find it in stats later and that's all there is to it it's very simple now let's imagine right here i want to go and i want to see the stats on the broadcast i since just sent so in guard here we can view stats and i'll just look at this email right here okay you can see the stats everybody opened i can see exactly how much this email generated me what people bought everything like that and i can go through and see who clicked this email make a segment for that i can go back and see who complained i can go back and see exactly how much i earned per click per open uh per everything and i wasn't even pitching anything this email so that's really cool it shows like hey if i send like value content out people still are like buying stuff through that so i can go right here maybe i want to mail the unopened people uh move around and this just gives me more ways to segment my list and mail people and talk and have different conversations with the type of customers that i've had based on the behavior that they've interacted with me with that's a lot of big words but i can basically talk to people based on what they've done and have a real conversation with them instead of sending everybody the exact same thing that's really the coolest thing on top of the ltv tracking instead of market hero i think so if you have any more questions be sure to hit up our super handy support right here they'll be able to answer everything for you and that's how the broadcast system works it's really simple really easy to use um again just recap it real quick to send you broadcast you just click new broadcast if you want to see your stats or what's going on with your broadcast right now i just click here and you can see the stats names everything like that so fairly simple that's all there is to it and i'll catch you in the next training

alright hey there buddy old pal this is Becker again and we're going to be getting into you how to use your lead section right now since you have asked for help so what I want to show you how to do is how to use the lead section and what this section does is two main things one it allows you to find segments of your lead search for leads find whose active who's not basically fine all the info you need to know about your leads and put certain people in certain places and then it also allows you to do is calculate the amount of money that you've earned from those leads so for example right here if I want to go search for a specifically and we're gonna start with the most basic use of this and get down to the more complicated uses of it now first things first let's get into how to actually import leads okay it's that super simple but you're gonna go out here and you're just gonna grab a CSV file so I'm gonna grab this one right here and how it works and let me just open up the CSV file for you is what's gonna happen is you gonna import your CSV file and you're gonna have the columns in the CSV file let me open it up so you can see what it looks like okay so we have the CSV file open right here and these are all fake emails so don't worry about that that's just an example emails but what we have is different columns right here and you can set columns for whatever you want so if we want to put all the people's emails in this column all their corresponding names and lastname and these columns you can totally do that super cool what I usually just do is I import the email so it's just straight up so you won't have a column that has all your emails on it so after you import it you're gonna see when you upload it all the different columns that are in your CSV file so I'm gonna go right here and mark this one as you know so that's what it is that's gonna tell the system its email then we're gonna fill a little bit of information right here so first off we want to tag it leads so I'm gonna mark these as source with okay adding it to my source wave list right here now and what we want to do right here that might confuse you a little bit is we want to go and look at your previous mailings of these emails on your previous mailing platform okay a lot of other mailers or autoresponders they won't even let you import leads or they're gonna call you in the phone or they're gonna talk to you or they're gonna do all sorts of things to make sure the leads you're importing are good leads okay and that improves the improve ability or the deliverability of the entire system so what we want to do is streamline that we don't have to call you on the phone we don't have to talk to you we don't have to like expect you or anything like that if you just give us access to your previous mailing platform our staff can go in make sure that you've explored the list the right way make sure you exported all your active leads not unsubscribe people that are gonna complain and stuff like that and um make sure that you're bringing leads you're gonna get a lot of success within the system now this is optional you can import the leads and not give us your information but you're gonna need to talk to our staff and you're gonna tell us need to tell us where these leads are coming from and we're gonna need to talk to you about it because we can't have you coming in and importing twenty five thousand people that you have no business emailing which some people will do and that's why we yeah and this system right here now if you don't want to play by these rules you can simply integrate with Amazon SES and you can send from your own email server that's completely fine we'll allow you to do that but if you want to send from our server we just simply need you to do this we're not gonna go and do anything weird inside your mailing platform we're just gonna make sure that you've emailed these leads in the past and you are these are people that you're actually talking to you so I'm just gonna put like Aweber right here I'm gonna put just a fake user name fake password and a contact number we can call you app if we need to talk to you now after you import your leads what's usually gonna happen is we have people watching the imports 24/7 you're gonna see a little pop-up right here and our staff is gonna message you just asking a little bit about your leads and then they'll approve the leads for you to mail it's that easy it's that simple that's all there is to it so let's actually get into you actually using the lead system the fine leads and import leads and getting more you know complicated stuff so if I wanna go in just search for an email for example I can just go up here and if I know there's a specific email on my list I can just go look it up right here and then if I want to do anything to that email I can simply select it I can do a whole bunch of things I can delete it I can export it I can add tags to it I can remove tags from it I can generate and see exactly how much that email is actually spent with me you can see this this dude actually has not spent anything so I can also go no I don't want to delete the lead but you can see how easy it is to go and do that so if I want to go all right here and I want to search for tags with a certain or leads with a certain tag I just click are here to click show results and you can see right here it shows me all these leads now if I want to I can go generate the LTV and you can see it's ten cents per lead right here now I just upload this list the other day the usual math I make per lead from this list is like $15 per lead or something like that but the six months of tracking is in there quite yet so now what we can also do is a lot more advanced segmentation for example we can go and say source wave and I can say anybody who's bought the product let's just say this offer right here okay and so I can go and I can do anybody that has both these tags okay so what it's gonna show is three of them alright so I can see right here the exact value for each of these leads to 749 dollars if you can see I okay I can see these two these people bought our Herer have this tag and have bought this proc so you can see I can use this describe a lot of things now I can also go and say okay let's get everybody that has a tax source way but hasn't bought this products I can go right here and go like OMG op store we can do this with tags too I'm just doing a products right here and it will pull up a list of people that haven't buzz so let's say a lot of people on my list have gone and bought a certain product I don't want to market them again with that type of off right there so we'll give me a segment of my list I can go and work with and I can go right here and I can send the email to musing this this option to send email to this segment is not currently here yet but should be here when you hop in and I can add tags to these people and I can remove tags and do whatever I want so we can basically describe any type of lead in this situation now we can click right here on advanced and we can go and find everybody that's do you know has opened in the past four months so if we want to clean and get rid of everybody that hasn't opened what we can do is we can simply go and say all right these people have opened in the last four months or so we ran a specific tag to them and then anybody that doesn't have that tag we just delete from our list or we move into like a dead email segment of our list we can see the last click date and we can see who's unsubscribe basically everything you get everyone know so if I want to see like everybody complained on my email list it will show 18 contexts and so I don't want these people on my email list okay so what I'm gonna do right now I'm just gonna delete them because these people you know complain when they receive emails so those people are gone forever so you can see how I'm easily going through my list and in finding any type of segment any type of description any type of person on my list and then building it like that it's very cool it's very flexible and while it's very simple you can go super deep with it so I could be like anybody that has this this tag and the source wave tag has all these tags and I'm not sure people have it doesn't have like the tag let's just say Alex Beckham you all right and so I can do that no one's going to show up on that right there because there's no combination but we can just get as deep into the segmenting as you want now the last thing I want to show you that we've already touched on but I just want to go over it is if you click right here and you go okay I want to get rid of that people have a complaint I just delete everyone a complaint so I want to show sealed active people to have the source wave tag so you can see right here boom and what we're going to do now is we can go and generate the LTV for everybody on here so give it one sec and so we'll go on show us the long-term value so this is really important when you're building out your ads and you're saying okay so everybody who came through the specific funnel let's say we tagged somebody the second they enter one of our opt-ins oh we can see exactly how much they spent and as they are on our list longer longer you're going to see the value of that email increase as if people keep buying more and more stuff from you so that's super important when it comes to growing your ads and advertising that's one of the most beautiful things about market here we're gonna have a lot more functions coming in that show you like the amount of time it takes to get the LTB how much they spend over time so you'll see how much you earn on 1 week 2 week 3 weeks on average a lot of other cool stuff like that but this is how you use the lead section if you have any questions be sure to just hit up our super friendly awesome support right here and they'll be all over it for you so that's what I got for you this has been Becker and be sure to use their support if you need anything we're here 24/7 so take it easy

[Music] okay guys this is Becker again welcome to the fourth video the end of this video the T-shirt button will unlock you able to enter your address and we'll be transplanting that funnel into your account but let's talk about how to send emails to all those people that are opting in now and all the people that you imported earlier on so before we send an email what you're going to want to do is you're want to go to settings and you want to fill out this information right here you want to give your business address when signing up if you don't want to use your actual address that's fine and you also want to put in your send name your default reply to email all this information right here so that market Hero has your information when you send it out it won't actually let you send an email until you put the stuff in because it's illegal to go out there and send emails without a return address so now that you've done that what you want to do is we want to go over here to broadcast you want to go to add new broadcast now very simple I'm just going to go put in my address I'm going to be sending from and when you get inside there's actually going to be a guide called the SPF guide it's going to be above this right here it's going to be the first thing you also see when you come in it's a quick little thing you can add to your websites to make sure your emails get almost double the deliverability that they probably do at other places you're probably using a random email or like a support email that you don't have connected to your site because of that your deliverability is probably hurting a lot from that so be sure to watch that now I'm going to put in my from name right here and this is where stuff starts to get fun so I'm going to go right here and I'm going to put in who's going to receive this email let's so let's say I want everybody who has the Alex Becker tag on them anybody who's joined my Alex Becker brand list I I want to send an email to them okay but let's imagine I'm sending this out to them and I'm trying to romote a product I just sent them so I don't want to send the same email that people have already bought something so what I can do right here is I can go down to Advanced setting and I want to have add a negative tag or a negative segment to this and so I go right here and I can put in the dollar sign and I can go and pick offers someone might have bought or I can pick another tag any combination of anything so I have this right here and you're going to see this is going to subtract 11 people from that total segment right there so what we have now is a segment of people who have not bought a certain product but are on a certain list pretty cool right we can easily go and do all sorts of stuff with this and all sorts of other combinations that we'll get into and then more advanced tutorials inside the system now what we can do right here is we can go and send an email we can use a template by just clicking here and loading up templates we've used in the past you can see really simple uh template that I have used in the past there or we can just go create a new email now the way the email Builder works really simple we just go here we can add text we can add an image if we want and um that's it we can go out here you can start writing your email out we can format it we can go and change uh the styles of the font you know really easy to use we can change the width of the email you can change the color uh everything in here is customizable to whatever extent you want we can go change you know the image Dimensions right here we can do anything we want inside of this uh it's extremely flexible extremely simple and really good at sending really simple plain sexy emails to just look great you can also go out there add images add your own HTML and stuff like that that makes it you know look super unique but one emailing tip right here the more plain your email is the less HTML you have going on the better chance you have delivering and getting in the inbox especially that Gmail promotions tag if you have a lot of images it's going to be really hard to inbox in the promotions tag like that so I'm just going to hit save right here and let's just imagine I'm going to send this ugly email out don't do this to your list you goof and then I go over here and hit send now and boom it goes out now let's say I want to see the stats for this email we're going to click back the broadcast so what we can now do is we can go back through our emails that we' sent out and we can click see stats we can actually see everyone who's opened it we can create a segment based on that which I'll show you in a second we can see how much money that email generated based on the tracking codes we talked about even down right to to the earning per email that we sent out now say we want to mail to everybody that didn't open it we can go right here click on opened and boom it will show us a list of everybody didn't open and we can just go up here and send it to them so that's the broadcast system in a nutshell that's all there is to it you can do a lot of advanced things with it or you can keep it really simple and that's the Pinnacle of what we want to do at Mark hero allow you to do super Advanced Marketing in a very simple easy to understand way so this has been Becker I'll see you on the next page

[Music] hey what's going on welcome to video 3 here are just one video after this away from the t-shirt and getting my entire paid funnel that I've been using imported into your system so listen up stay tuned we're just we're almost done here so what we're going to do in this video is build our basic optins and our basic email funnels now inside the system when you get inside there's a much more detailed explanation if you can't figure out how to do this on your own I feel a lot of people will be to figure it out cuz it's so simple but if you need or need any more information there's going to be a little bubble down here that you can click that will show you all the videos and everything you can do to use this in advanced ways but let's start off with a basic funnel slil stream so we're going to click new stream right here and what you're going to do is you're going to create your first optin right here so what the optin is going to do is it's going to build an optin for you now you can do a bunch of different things right here for the optin button that you use you can go and create a button that will have a drop down you can use an image instead you can use a link uh you you can even go and create your own HTML code from it uh that will generate when you build it out here and you can go and paste that HTML code anywhere so if I want to go here and I set this button to be like this um and I go to preview and I remove the first name and last name so you can see this is what this is what's going to drop down when people click it but I'm going to remove the first and last name I could even go over and click okay right here and go to the form it'll give me an HTML code I can use to embed in lead Pages or any opt-in form system you're using however our system does it just as well and how it's going to work is just like this you can see boom pops down gives us an optin right here this is what converts the highest however if you have your own forms and stuff like that you can always just embed our HTML into that so um this is done simply by going and grabbing the embed code that market hero is going to spit out to you and you just embed it wherever you want in your site so we'll create that button if you use an image you can create your own button that will be used instead of what was used in an image heck you can even just create a text link that will bring down a drop down for you so that's how it is people go into the system and very simple so then what you can do right here is we want to go and I'm going to apply a tag to let me know that people opted in through this optin so I'm going to make a new tag that says Market Hero Test optin so anybody that comes in through this optin will be tagged with this tag and so I can easily go search them up later on and calculate how much money they've made me or just see who joined through this optin so then what I want to do is I want to add an email that will be sent to the person so go right here we can send one email and then I'm going to have it go in I'm just going to I'm going not really fill this out because we don't really need to do all this and I'm not going to get into the email Builder too much we'll get into the next video and I'm just going to hit save okay so let's imagine then I want to uh let's just say apply another tag right here I actually want to sort by tag uh and so everybody that comes in I want to go two directions so let's have an email right here let's have an email right here actually we'll put a delay right here and this is where I'm going to show you just the basic automation Side Market hereo so let's say we want to sort by the market Hero Test tag that we created all right so we can go right here and we can go and type in right there so let's say that the person has that tag and so if they do have the tag they'll get sent here if they don't have the tag they'll get sent here very simple um and so then I can go here to delay and I can set wait at least 3 days and I can set a specific time or whatever for it to run and then I can have them get sent this email so look what's been done right here very simple to use person opts in Market hero tag is applied to them they're send an email then it sorts them by the market hero tag that was applied to them in a yes no situation if they have the tag which they will cuz we applied it right here they'll go to this delay they'll wait 3 days they'll get an email they don't have the tag which won't happen in this situation but just showing the automation they'll get this email and so that's how we go and build our basic email funnels that's how we go and create our opin you just created this crazy automated Advanced thing in just two seconds right here in Market hero and that's what we're all about so this is how this works there'll be much deeper instructions if you click the little bubble that will show up right here in every tab there's a little button that shows you more detail instructions on how to use it but that's how it works so this is been Becker you have one more video to go and that's it so let's get on to that right now I'm going to show you to send your broadcast and do some basic lead segmenting it's going to allow you to do some really cool segmenting and advanced mailing and whatever else you want to do so see you in the next video
