life sold all my belongings quit my job bought this like $2,000 van on Craigslist I flew out to his Warehouse in California to get his story and ask him how he got his first sale and the marketing strategy he used to go from $5,000 a month to $500,000 a month getting good good at marketing the sales just go nuts Jeremy started his journey trying tons of different business ideas but none of them made any money then one day he discovered a secret that led him to making $5,000 in a single day well we've always strive for us and that's where you could start to like make more money than Ecom in this video the van man breaks down how to find new million doll product ideas his simple blueprint to generate a million dollar a month and the number one platform he would choose if he had to start all over I think he the best place to start I'm Pat walls and this is starter story Jeremy right Jeremy yeah yeah thanks for having me man tell me a little bit about what you built and who you are my name is Jeremy um also known as van Man online in 2021 we started a natural alternatives business with toothpaste and and balms we try to make natural alternatives to everyday products it's like a simplified van life version of a product we started just like a $5,000 month I think our first month and then we've had like our first million dollar month that we did over 5 million last year so you started the van man while you're working a full-time job can you tell me more about that um so it started just kind of down on my luck like wanted to reset my life sold all my belongings quit my job bought this like $2,000 van on Craigslist only spend time working trying to like really get my energy back that I lost from these startups I had an account called van man on Twitter so I would post about random things like health things sometimes I got big into like anti fluoride so I bought some Florida toothpaste on accident I just wanted to like swear off toothpaste so instead of like making my own I just bought a box of baking soda and like dip my toothbrush in and just brush with baking soda baking sod is like harsh it's super salty so after a while I just started adding stuff to it and like all the while I was documenting this on Twitter people are like well I'll try that I'll try that and then oh I have like a product here so you're living at a van and building an audience how do you come up with the idea to build this I was just scrolling on Twitter and I saw like Arnold Schwarzenegger video where he puts the egg in the protein shake I started tweeting about that like maybe eggshells are uh good for your teeth found eggshell powder started putting that in the tooth powder I really like that I launched it we sold like a couple hundred like the first hour from there was just trying to take each part of like product that I use that I use myself and just replace it with something well thought out that's like made with animal products what would be your like number one and number two biggest products number one is a Talon honey bomb for sure that was like the one that set it off I was just blown away but it just like kept coming kept coming the reviews are going nuts and people just keep sharing it for no money like they're just showing it cuz they love it so much and like that was huge but uh the second product I think mint bone toothpaste that's like our second best seller now but yeah we're trying to get soap out soon I think that will be like a top seller Jeremy has proof that a simple idea can turn into millions of dollars but his success has nothing to do with luck it came from having the right information and knowing what problems were worth solving well imagine there was a place that helped you find this the problems to solve the blueprints to solve them and the strategies that turn simple ideas into a million dooll online businesses at starter story we have a library of over 4,000 case studies and business idea breakdowns all

solving so you can find an idea and get started on your journey much love and hope you guys enjoy the rest of the interview peace all right tell me about where we are right now this is uh where all the products get made this is a vanman headquarters in San Diego so you actually create all the product and package it and ship it all from here yeah so everything's handmade here the Tallow is like scooped in by hand with a spoon it has been since like day one and then I don't see any change cuz we just got to do it by hand I think we'll just keep doing it by hand for forever but yeah every everything's made here and ships out of the same building on a given average day how much product are you creating and shipping out of here we ship about 500 600 orders a day when it's going good could be there's spikes and then downturns too but yeah it's 5600 yeah so you have this tooth powder you put it together how do you get your first customer it kind of happened accidentally it was like more tweeting along the way building the product as soon as I launched it it was in 20 minutes it was like mostly sold out people were already in a community that I was a part of so it's was like selling to that community that all kind of lived in that same Paradigm like of course eggshells are good for you cuz we already in this animal based Paradigm so it's like the customers taught me this knowledge and then I gave them this product almost do you remember how many sales you did that first day you put it up on Shopify I think it it was less than 100 tooth Powers I just made a big batch I thought I was going to sell like 5 10 15 I think we sold about 100 of them something like that yeah what was your schedule like how hard were you working during those days try to get up as early as I can like sometimes I'll get up at like 7 6 just melting it all down getting it like spinning cuz we have to spin it for a long time to get the honey in before it's too cold some days it be like 12 hours and then the next day would be nothing then another 12-hour day so it was like definitely like halfhazard but my hands were just from holding the spoon and like putting it in there like it's just like yeah excruciating after a while doing the same thing controversial marketing yeah so like it's kind of just viral posts like I found like the most divisive posts on Instagram are the ones that like generate comments and Traction in in Instagram then it gets shared it gets surfaced to everybody Instagram posts and emails like I didn't think email marketing would do much but email seems to be a lot better than I thought and then I try to do like meme marketing like a picture of Mel Gibson talking to Mark Wahlberg and then I just like write what the voice would be that got a lot of traction so like saying what I want to say but with a recognizable face with a meme that makes it relatable and sharable yeah meme marketing yeah it's kind of everything nowaday and you noce a big up taking sales when something does well there yeah like you could see it on Instagram like I'll post something then like yeah the sales just go nuts it's crazy cuz it's just like 5 minutes of work but like sometimes you're browsing for 3 or 4 days to try to find a good thing to put on getting good at like meme marketing isn't just like thinking of a meme for 20 minutes a day it's like being perpetually online that picture of Mel Gibs and Mark Wahlberg was like a big UFC fight getting that the next day when it's fresh in people's mind I think that's big it's like getting current events and turning them into memes and then relating it back to a product probably the three things that I try to do I guess if I was to break it down all right let's talk about product expansion you start with this toothpaste what do you build after that and then what are all the products that you've created so now we're just like in the bathroom Focus kind of on hygiene products so we have deodorant mouthwash hair oil and then we're coming out with soap soon and just kind of like finish out like the hygiene products then go to like I want to release like food sell our own tala get our own Bee Farm sell our own honey sort of like bridge the gap to fixing like restaurants like where you could actually go out to eat and get like a good meal every product we've had has like done pretty well so we haven't like had to discontinue one or anything and it's now like I'm just trying to focus on what's what's next and how we can get there faster and have you noticed that new products have expanded your Revenue like your existing customers want to buy all your products yeah so like that's the thing like the average order goes up like when you get most people are buying like the tooth powder is like under 20 bucks M FL is under 20 bucks but then when you get five or six products that are under 20 bucks then you get the bigger orders and that's where you could start to like make more money in Ecom cuz you get higher average orders your shipping is going down the processing is going down to ship the order getting to that point was when like we actually started to have free cash flow like in the beginning it was just like you're not making much money cuz you're making these things so slowly you're buying ingredients in very small amounts and then it just kind of like grows where you're buying in bulk you have other people making it you get some little tools that help you make it faster what's the vision for Van man where do you see this going in 5 10 20 yeah 40 years so I think we have like a unique position where we striving for like lifetime value but we get like almost 40% of the customers that buy something come back that's like what we've always sted for is like customer service like if you have any problem at all we're going to try to make it go away 100% like immediately and then uh we sell a lot of Bison fat and we sell a lot of cow fat where we can turn that into going backwards to like owning our own cows owning our own bison and starting to like offshoot more products from those animals themselves like starting to sell milk or starting to sell like meat we can make more money per animal we could take way better care of the animals and the final like product of meat we could almost sell for nothing because we've made enough money to not even have to worry about what we get for the meat that's sort of like the goal is delivering premium products allowing for premium care of the animal premium cuts of meat for like Walmart prices is like kind of the goal is extremely affordable high quality meat and eggs and and dairy and everything so what does a day in life look like for you nowadays in the morning you just come in try to make sure there's no like fires that you got to put out just kind of do a roundabout of like the ingredients make sure we're not like running out of anything and then um a lot of time is just being online commenting answering DMS emails trying to come up with different posts that I think resonate as soon as I put the post up then just kind of being there in the comments for the next few hours I think that's a huge por like you you don't want to delegate that like anytime that's when you're getting the pulse of what everyone thinks of everything that you're doing basically yeah if you could sit on Jeremy's shoulder when you were starting out when you're in the van when you were broke what would be your advice I think Etsy is the best place to start you could browse on Etsy for product ideas put your own spin on it and sell it right back on Etsy if you got a couple dollars like test ads I think you should just always be testing ads on different products and then you find that one winning ad that could float your next month and then yeah just never stop cuz I think some people get a couple failures and then they finally give up or they get like a wife and then they just accept their job but like this just for me like just never never accept that life and just try anything to get out and then once you get out you have like your whole life to live I feel like all right man thank you so much that was great yeah that was fun follow this advice and you will have a multi-million dollar company selling T powder T talb bomb yeah
