TITLE: Day 474 growing my SaaS startup to $1M
VIDEO ID: hXuu1jjYsjo

================================================================================

Hey, get the camera rolling. Okay. Rejecting $1 million in cash, building a mobile app in 24 hours with AI, reaching 85% of my million-doll SAS goal, our new life in Greece, and a bunch of other things. Let's get this video rolling. &gt;&gt; Mark just turned down $1 million deal on MR here in Greece. &gt;&gt; Hopefully, we find the home here. In 4 weeks, there was 1,000 startups listed for sale. That is crazy. I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] proud of myself. &gt;&gt; Less than a day of work. No idea how to build iOS and Android apps. 3K to do until you were a child making. &gt;&gt; Is it time I tell you I don't have a gift yet? Wow. &gt;&gt; No time to think of consequences. Show yourself. only a family of trees to be haunted. The water is warm but suddenly shivers. A baby is born. Crying out for attention. Guys, I just heard a crazy news. Mark just turned down $1 million deal on Trust Mr. We have to investigate. Husband $1 million. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How can you reject this? First of all, who buy start of leaderboard with $1 million? Explain. &gt;&gt; How do I start? Someone reach out. They say that they want to buy trustmr for 1 million cash. I said no because I think the value was higher and I I just love the project. And then uh I realized that you know like when you do acquisitions and stuff you stay on board for a little bit and I I think I got scared of it. I wanted to work for myself so I don't want to work for someone if that makes sense. &gt;&gt; I like my cow free range like this. &gt;&gt; So because of that we said no. &gt;&gt; What is trust Mr. now? Because last time when we shared it on YouTube it was just the leaderboards. This is a bit crazy, but this is the massive pivot from a leaderboard to startup acquisition marketplace. So, initially the website looked like this. That's the leaderboard. And then you have this entire marketplace where all those startups here, those are the startups that are on sale. And when you like one, you go here, you say, I want to contact the seller. You enter your email here. Then once you're done, you enter this dashboard that I spend some time building. You have a conversation with the person. You agree on the price. to talk about whatever you want to sell like the domain name are you going to work with a person after you sell the startups and stuff what's the crazy part is every single day there is one startup that is acquired &gt;&gt; really already &gt;&gt; yeah because I think it's getting a lot of noise like I think it gets around 5 to 6,000 visitors per day the thing is I realized that building the marketplace is one thing but then after people have to do stuff create legal documents a letter of intent assess purchase agreement I had no idea what was it was so I had to do like some research and stuff and I built something in the app where you can draft all those legal documents You have those acquisition progress like you can draft an APA and then you enter all the legal stuff and you make a little signature right here. Haha. This will generate documents for you. Like AI is so good cuz then it makes those legals documents for me. Helps me make prepare those documents. And then the final part that's where the monetization of the marketplace come in. You need like a third party that you trust that you can send money to. you can send the assets to. Then it's time to transfer the assets to the buyer and then the third party sends back the money to the seller and boom, the transaction is done. And we do that with escrow at the moment. Most importantly, they handle disputes if you know you get scammed by someone. And those are all the new startups transactions that are listed almost every single day. In 4 for sale. I think selling your startup is kind of life-changing. You know, like if you make $1,000 per month with your startup, you can easily sell it for like 30 35,000. With $30,000, you go to Vietnam, Danong, whatever. You like a cheap Southeast Asia place. You leave for 2 years. You have 2 years of leftover. &gt;&gt; The parents reaction was also fun. &gt;&gt; Is it okay? &gt;&gt; I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] proud of myself. I coach the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] camera with my dame [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] feet. I am a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] legend. When you work online probably our parent generation cannot really understand what we are doing. The moment when you sell your startup the way they look at you become different. Please don't feel alone even though you cannot be understood. Just keep working hard show your value and when you have the right moment you can harvest all those effort from you know selling your startup. Justin is the place to sell. But no, no, seriously, not to be jo like not to be like the goal is not to be salesy, but we sold three startups and every single time there's a little life-changing moment. It can give you some runover money that you know you can feel free to build more stuff. There are also websites like acquire.com and FIPA who are also places where you can sell. Actually, I sold two of the startups on acquire.com. &gt;&gt; Why people has to choose you rather than those two platforms? acquire.com and those platforms are more for bigger businesses. I think this is targeting like more indie businesses like we build. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Um so that has a better fit with the audience I think &gt;&gt; to ship it and sell it fast. &gt;&gt; Acquire fast. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Back to work. He has a bunch of features to ship. &gt;&gt; Let's let tonight's performance be the best performance. the Santes Iroas. This is about the Air Force memorial. You serious? &gt;&gt; I started to learn Greek uh for one week on Dualingo because we're staying in Greece to cyers for 2 months. So I thought learning Greek would be nice to talk with the locals and learning language is my passion. So why are we here? Why are we in Greece? &gt;&gt; Three things. Number one, we got to meet some entrepreneurs. Number two, &gt;&gt; there are many longevity hacks here. So, we're going to discover why they live that long cuz it looks like Greek people are very happy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I mean that's one of the real reason we're here because we want to build longevity hotels like a little place where you have like 10 mini villas, you know, you have like a super nice bedroom or soundproof. It's completely dark. You have a bed that is a cooling mattress. You have a air purifier. You have a food that is like prepared by a chef where it's approved to be very healthy. Since Greece is a an amazing place for this, we're looking for lens and stuff to see if that is possible. one less reason. &gt;&gt; We're leaving our home for 7 years. &gt;&gt; Bye-bye, Bali. And we're looking for a new place to, you know, just leave. And Greece is on the top of the list because it's amazing, sunny, good food, good people. So hopefully we find a home here, man. I think we have to go gym now. &gt;&gt; Good day start with a workout. &gt;&gt; I think there's some smell. I think it's all smell of PR. &gt;&gt; So, what is your goal? &gt;&gt; 120. &gt;&gt; 120 for how many reps? &gt;&gt; Three. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; This is my coach. &gt;&gt; 120. But you did last night. I can do 123 also because I have 1 1.25. &gt;&gt; 5 by 5. 12. &gt;&gt; Okay. Deal. &gt;&gt; This is breakfast for me. &gt;&gt; Nice. &gt;&gt; I don't even need to score. Not in the main course. &gt;&gt; What is this coming? &gt;&gt; 125. &gt;&gt; 125. Ah, it's your PR. &gt;&gt; It's three times bigger than your face. My gym rookie. &gt;&gt; Engage your either. Engage your &gt;&gt; fighting or watch out. &gt;&gt; You could have done five. &gt;&gt; Easy. &gt;&gt; Let's see. 1:30. 1:30. &gt;&gt; 1:30. &gt;&gt; 130. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Come on. Okay. &gt;&gt; I think he wants to make us do veget. &gt;&gt; How many kilo is it? &gt;&gt; 105. &gt;&gt; Wow. 105. through the hard times. I have to celebrate you, baby. I have to praise you. &gt;&gt; I am pumped as hell. So, a minute ago, I checked my emails and there is a deal on TrustMr, an acquisition deal for $100,000. And it's not just like random number like people spamming or anything. The deal is actually in escrow. And the papers have already signed the letter of intent, the um asset purchase agreement. Maybe this like little stupid marketplace that I launched a couple weeks ago is about to have a $100,000 deal. And since now the the marketplace is monetized, we're gonna get a 3% fee. So just like that, by facilitating the transaction, we're going to make $3,000. That is mad. That is completely crazy. &gt;&gt; So for the record, the monetization of the marketplace is like 48 hours old. I hope this happens. I will keep you posted. This guy just sold a startup for $85,000 on my little platform. Yogesh a couple months ago started to build his own startup and grow it from like zero to a couple thousand in monthly recurring revenue. Then he wanted to sell so he listed it on TrustMr for $100,000. He received six offers and among them one person said yes and they agreed on a transaction for $85,000. This is the biggest acquisition on Trust Mr. And in the same time, I earn a 3% finder fee. So, I made $2.6,000, which is also the biggest amount of money I earn in a single transaction. That makes me so excited because the platform is new. It's only 45 days old. So, who knows what could be happening in the future. And as a little motivation reminder, this entire website was born in like 8 hours just foding a little uh website and then I just built features that people requested. Even the marketplace thing was not a thing at the beginning. It was just I was just listening to someone who wanted to sell their startup on the platform and now it's paying the bills more than I would ever expect. So, uh, keep shipping those videos. &gt;&gt; Are we live? Yes, we're live. Good morning. It is 7:16. It is time to rock and roll. Today, I have a massive update to make. I need to try Clo after all those months of not trying it. I will build a mobile app with it. I hope I can make it in one day. That would be crazy. And yeah, just a regular day. We are rolling. &gt;&gt; Someone just bought the new monetization I tried for Trust Mr. which is since there are many people listing startups, I'm trying to add premium listing where people who list their startup, they'll get more visibility if they pay a little fee. So it goes from 99 for 30 days or 499 for uh also 30 days but get more visibility and that push the listing higher in the ranking algorithm and some perks like uh they can choose the colors of their listing so it stand out more it goes to the newsletter etc. And this is the startup of this new type of product I'm selling on trust R. Let's see how that goes. I think they got over 100 buyers checking out their page in the last couple of hours. The multiple is a little high. I think it's over nine multiple with like 50% profit margin. So, this will be a harder startup to sell. But, uh, you know, we never know. &gt;&gt; What happened? &gt;&gt; I was not expecting this. That's something to tell you. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. It's coming. &gt;&gt; Feels unreal. &gt;&gt; 17K. Yay. &gt;&gt; 3k to go until 20k. This is absolutely mind-blowing. So, everybody is talking about clo code at the moment. So far, I didn't have a good reason to use it. And then I realized I wanted to build a little mobile app for my software analytics like data fast. And I thought it would be a perfect use case to try clo code for the first time. And man, I'm so glad I tried. It's insane. So, first I built API endpoints for basically the entire data pass dashboard. If you're a dataf user now, you will see in the documentation is slide. You can literally get all your data fast data using your API key and you can build an entirely new dashboard if you want. Then I initiated cloud code and I just asked low code to go dive into datafast codebase and build a native mobile app for users to be able to just read their data using the newly created API endpoints and within 24 hours the app was done. It's mad. I have to show you how it works. So here now I can see the list of all of my websites and for each of them I have pretty much the same thing that I would see in my data fast dashboard. Revenue generated, where visitors are coming from, which pages they visit, which country they're coming from, the goals they complete. I can also see which refers make the most money. Less than a day of work, not typing a single word. I have no idea how to build iOS and Android apps. And this was entirely made with AI. This is absolutely insane. So right now the app is under review. So, if you are a Dataf Fast user, when this video is released, there is a very high chance that the app is also released on the store. So, go check out Dataf Fast in the app store. So, you can import all your analytics and just have your analytics on the go. Man, we live in a crazy world. &gt;&gt; Ah, man. Today is the my favorite and and most hated day. &gt;&gt; What is the day? &gt;&gt; V2 max. 1 km as fast as possible and then recovery for 1 km. &gt;&gt; So, you're going to kill yourself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then we're going to have a lovely lunch. &gt;&gt; So, what is your goal of the speed? &gt;&gt; I think 345 per kilometer. I ain't trying to tell you what to do, but try to play cool. I ain't playing by your rules. Everything look better. &gt;&gt; Man, you killed me. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was hardcore. Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Look at me. The protein and the vegetable baby. I playing by your rules. Everything better with a view. &gt;&gt; Bonjour. &gt;&gt; Data fast is finally live on product hunt after being in the shadow whatever not on product hunt for like 450 something plus days. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Product hunt of the day for data fast. I made this little demo video. I usually make those kind of videos when I want to launch a new product or an old product, but they haven't launched yet. I try to make them fun so they get a little bit of attention and that helps promote the launch. If you have 2 minutes of your life to lose, I'll add a link to this video on the description of this video if you want to watch it. Now, it's time to go. A girl and I typical desire in the water not a message from &gt;&gt; I shipped 21 features on trust Mr. in the last 3 months. AI has removed the gap from ideal and reality and we live in the best moment in the entire tech history. It's crazy. Just keep shipping. So far just hoping I seem wondering again. The wind around the window will felt the ice. The message of time down the window and now I'm thinking of the wind. The bottle in the ocean. The strikes the message from God for shows emotion.

================================================================================

So, we are going to use Google Analytics. &gt;&gt; Get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out. &gt;&gt; So, we are going to use something that respects users privacy and it's very powerful. I'm talking a &gt;&gt; Yeah, we know who you are. &gt;&gt; Let me show you at least how powerful this is. It must be the analyst working with the beta tester on the on the UH &gt;&gt; we are going to use very simple analytics. I'm talking visitor data just like this or important business metrics like user retention. This is for the past 24 hours. Uh this is yesterday. Uh this is the last week. Uh this is those are the same numbers. &gt;&gt; It's because we don't use a cookie. So we don't know what happened after 24 hours. But at least Angela Merkel is happy. What if we take our business revenue and we put it on top of our analytics data? And then we attribute the revenue to the person who made the purchase. So we find our best marketing channel. And it's so easy that it only takes 3 minutes to set up so that you can spend your time working on what truly matters. It comes with a customer journey where you can see everything a visitor did before making a purchase and it comes with real time visitors map to make your mom proud. And best of all, it has 14 days of free trial. Oh wow. I I I guess people really hate good analytics. Okay. All right. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? It's Twitter. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. &gt;&gt; Go back to work. &gt;&gt; Well, I guess check my product data fast. I hope you'll like it.

TITLE: I made $1M in 2025 (WRAPPED)
VIDEO ID: JKFmLdoLm8M
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKFmLdoLm8M
================================================================================

I made over $1 million in 2025 from those 15 sources of income. And even though it's about 20% less than last year, I wouldn't change a thing because this was my most peaceful year ever. And also, this is the most diversified my portfolio has gotten. So, those two products right here are the one generating twothird of the revenue. Those are Codefast, which I launched last year and is making around $20,000 a month at the moment. And the other one is Ship Pass, my codebase for developer, which I launched over 2.5 years ago and is also making $20,000 a month at the moment. The next one in orange is DataFast, which is the one I'm the most proud of. It's a web analytics software. It tells me for all of my project how many visitors and how much revenue it has generated. I spent over 200 days uh building features for this product and sharing everything on Twitter. And that eventually paid off. Currently, the SAS is at 15 close to $16,000 in monthly recurring revenue and the annual recurring revenue is around $200,000 which with a multiple of four uh this would make an around $800,000 assets. I would of course never sell it, but just that makes me uh proud that I was able to build this thing and it's also my favorite product to work on because I never have to do any marketing. My users are actually doing marketing for me. They share a screenshot of their dashboard and then when people are curious um sometimes they mention that they're using datafast and that brings organic traffic to the product. All I have to do is to build a screenshot worthy features that my users hopefully are going to share on social media. To be honest, I don't really know what is next for data fast. Uh what I do is I just listen to feedback from power users and build the features. I also recently built this like a new little feature where I can see what people share on social media and when I when I see people mentioning features I just um if if many of them mention that I will just build a feature and hopefully that will grow the product. The next source of income and the most unexpected is the one in blue here which is around $50,000 uh uh which I launched two months ago in November 2025. This was initially this little website here uh where it's like a big database of uh startups. Each startup has a page where we can see the revenue over the last days, years, etc. Within a couple of days, this product went from zero uh just an idea to something making around 20 to $25,000 in monthly recurring revenue. This was a crazy journey. And if you're curious, there's a little video on my channel where um I share more about the initial launch. After the initial craze of the launch, I wanted to hopefully make this project sustain and maintain for long term. So I started to build vertical like a bunch of different alternatives like verticals of this initial project. So I made this game and a bunch of other verticals and most failed but one of them uh this one ended up working really well. This is a marketplace built on top of the database. So anyone can list a startup. uh those are the actual revenue from Stripe. Those revenue are verified which builds trust and the people who are interested in buying startups can just go here contact the seller and they enter a place where they can chat with the seller and hopefully they get acquired within the first 3 weeks of launching this feature. Uh there were bunch of new startup listing on sale and it keeps growing more and more every day and also about a dozen of startups have already been acquired. That makes me extremely happy and this is where I'm spending most of my time at the moment. Uh currently what people can do is they can uh they have a private dashboard where they can uh chat with uh people with buyers and sellers and the next step is to add a system where it creates all the legal documents. It put them in the escrow account and then the seller and the buyer can exchange assets safely. Another new source of income for me was stock markets. I made $140,000 this year from the stock market. Uh this is my portfolio or screenshot of my portfolio. I'm not a big fan of investing but I know that if I keep my money in the bank uh it will just be eaten by inflation. So I started investing in the uh S&amp;P 500. I think it's the most safest assets which has a good return on investment. So I started to dollar cost average on the S&amp;P 500. I started at $5,000 per week and I increased that to around $15,000 per week. I think right now I have close to a million dollar invested in the S&amp;P 500. And recently I started investing $5,000 per week in CHN which is basically the equivalent of the S&amp;P 500 but for Chinese tech company. Uh besides TrustMr I failed three new startups this year. Bio age which is an app that I use my wife and I use every day but for some reason it couldn't find any product market fit. Um I also failed this one which is a little clipping campaign. And the rest of my revenue is coming from this little software right here, which all combined, they made around $20,000 this year. They serve a specific purpose. I automated everything so that it doesn't take any time from me. And now a little note on the health side of things because I realized that the healthier I am, the more I take care of myself, the better I am at uh building startups. And so I recently reach minus 18 years old biological age with my wearable. It's telling me that I am 14 years younger than I currently am. It sounds a little bit cliche, but uh it's looking at a bunch of metrics in order to get this number. And it's actually pretty hard. It looks at the daily step counts over the last uh 6 months. Some metrics like V2 max, resting heart rate, how much you sleep, what is your sleep consistency, the time you spend in strength training, different heart rate zone, etc. One of the big games changer for me this year was that I started going to the gym and as a result, I gained 4 kilos of muscles. I never went to the gym before because I thought it would take too much of my time. But I also realized that it's much easier to go to the gym if you don't have motivation because you know there will be some people you've paid for the class, you've committed ahead and so that makes fitness a little easier for me. I also tested my V2 max for the first time this year. It's basically a test where you put they push you a rupture to see what is your lactates threshold. This is a really good indicator of your overall uh health and longevity markers. Uh my score was 57 something uh milliliters per minute per kilogram which puts me in the top 500 of males of my age. If you have ever done the test or if you intend to do it, it is just absolutely horrible because you literally have to run until you literally pass out. And final note on the health side, um as last year I also drunk zero liter of alcohol. I try to get at least 10k daily steps which made I think this year 4.2 million steps in 2025. And I eat I ate or I still eat 90% of clean food. And on the more personal side, my wife and I started to travel the world. We visited seven new countries this year. We've been to New Zealand, South Africa, Greece, where I am at the moment, India, South Korea, France. We've been a little bit everywhere because we're looking for a new place to leave after Bali. Another reason we started to travel is to meet you all, the ones uh behind the camera. Uh we started organizing meetups across each location we've been. Uh this was in India, this was in Korea, this was the first one in France. The goal with those meetups is to just gather a bunch of indie hackers. Uh we talk, we chat, it's super easy peasy and friendly. People make friends and sometimes they become co-ounders. Those meetups are really amazing and it warms my heart. And finally, those are my three favorite books I read this year. Uh I try to read 15 minutes a day either with my morning coffee or before I go to bed or both. And those are the ones I like the most. That's it for 2025. I hope 2026 unfold exactly like 2025 did. I'm on the same discipline. I want the same work life balance. I just hope that I can build more startups because I've been a bit slacking last year shipping only four side project. And now it's time to wish you a happy new year and all the best for 2026. I hope you crush all your side project and everything you dream of and I will see you in the next video. Cheers.

================================================================================

[music] Let's talk about the future of this YouTube channel. There will be some failures. Spend an entire day doing nothing. Some learnings. There will be [music] some new features. &gt;&gt; Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [laughter] It's amazing. There's your photo on the map. This is going to be the entire journey. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this. Growing a software business to a million [music] dollar in valuation. I'm going to polish this and ship it. &gt;&gt; It's AKM R. &gt;&gt; If you think about it, it's crazy though. &gt;&gt; Don't you dare. Don't you dare. &gt;&gt; We just can't believe what just happened. &gt;&gt; We did 400 MR in 2 days. &gt;&gt; Crazy. So, what is our MR now? &gt;&gt; 7K. &gt;&gt; 7K. The growth is crazy. &gt;&gt; Let's see right here. &gt;&gt; Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The subscriber turn rate is 6.8%. This is the lowest it [music] has ever been and it's down 27%. And we pass 500 subscribers. 500 paying customers. If you think about it, this is crazy, you know. 500 people who agrees to have their credit card charged by the end of each month by me. 500 people. It's like a plane of people and they're like they're flying with us and they're like, "Hey, it's okay. Here's my credit card numbers. At the end of the month, you can charge it because the product is good enough. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yes, as sun going to the moon. Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Actually, the thing is dataf fast price double on 31st October. That's what I said on Twitter a couple days ago and I think some people were in between subscribing and I want to be cuz people help me build this thing, right? I have a customer support. People tell me feedback and I just build what they say. Mhm. &gt;&gt; So thanks to the people who've been using this app from the beginning who trusted the app when there was nothing we've been able to build like this little SAS that now people like and [clears throat] so all the I don't know 600 700 previous customers they can keep the current price if they subscribe before October 31st or if they keep their subscription and because of that then the MR like just the [music] growth went from like growing 20% month over month to like 37% month over month now. &gt;&gt; So are you saying we have to increase the price often? [laughter] &gt;&gt; December we quadruple the price. Yes. It never stops. No, I think it's crazy and I think also it's fun because it picked and then it went flat for a couple days and then recently I announced this new feature. Yeah, you can see icons of people and so whenever someone mentioned data fast then then data fast will scout Twitter and then this is a visual feature. And I think a lot of people join because of that. Literally every single hour there's someone there's there are multiple at least two people mentioning that fastest. &gt;&gt; Here's a tip. Make a new viral feature. So make people talk about it. So the word of mouth it will grow your says very fast. &gt;&gt; Make it so freaking good that people cannot resist but share it. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Mr. 10k. Yay. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Come and set me free. &gt;&gt; Looks like you. &gt;&gt; Let's Let's talk about the future of this YouTube channel. Well, if you're new here, uh my name is Mark. I have built over 30 little websites in the past 3 years. Most of them failed. One of them changed my life. And it's a bit cliche, but I made enough money to not have to think about making money. And so that leaves rooms for experiments like uh growing a little software business to a million dollar in valuation, which is exactly what those new uh YouTube videos that I'm going to put out are going to be about. If you're wondering, a million dollar in valuation, it's basically around $20,000 in monthly recurring revenue. And then if you apply a multiple of four, you'll get a million dollar in valuation. This is just a fancy generic uh goal I give myself just to have something to snack on to know if I'm heading towards the right path. And in this uh new format of YouTube videos, I'm basically going to be documenting everything. So it's a behind the scenes of growing this software business. Uh there will be some failures, there will be some learnings, there will be some new features I build, there will be some AI uh lots of AI, lots of coffee as well. And I also believe that uh this new form of entrepreneurship is not just about the business itself, but also about the life around the business. So it wouldn't really be fun for me if I was not able to choose when I work uh go travel whenever I want to decide to just randomly on a Thursday afternoon watch a movie with my wife. So there will be a little bit of these too. Uh there will be some workouts. There will be some random diet experiments I'm trying in order to uh feel better in my body. There will be some health related stuff. There will be some travel across the world in those videos. This is going to be the entire uh journey. I'd like to do a little bit of everything and this is exactly what you're going to see in those videos. And talking about this, it is time for workouts. &gt;&gt; Let's make lots of [music] money. You got the brains. Let's make lots of money. It's working, bro. If people send with a real profile picture, then I'm going to see their real face on the map like this guy. &gt;&gt; That's why you're dancing like this. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're cooking. We're cooking. AI is cooking for us and we're dancing. Soon this map will be filled with avatars of my users. It's coming real. You know, it's like you see real. You're like, "Oh my god, this guy with this profile picture in this country is using my app at the moment." Yes. Okay. Real demo. Real freaking demo. You are going to sign up for that pass. Okay. Okay, you logged in. Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This is you. You're on the map. It's amazing. There's your photo on the map. Okay, this might be another useless feature, but now people can send metadata with data fast. This is coming alive. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Mark is super locked in and I'm afraid he's out of his mind now. I &gt;&gt; got to [music] polish this and ship it. Cheers. &gt;&gt; Let's pray the MR gods, &gt;&gt; please. [screaming] &gt;&gt; It's AKM RR. It took just 10 days [music] to get 1K MR. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait. The math is really fun. 4 month to 1K MRR, 3 months to 2K MR, 2 months to 3K MR, 1 month to 4K MRR, 3 weeks to [music] 5K, 2 weeks to 6K, and then very similar like 14 days and 10 days to 7 and 8. Don't you dare give up. Don't you dare. &gt;&gt; Why? You worked for a whole day. You lost track of time. You don't know what time to eat, what time to work out. &gt;&gt; Today was mental. Like I have a to-do list that is this big. Every single day there are more stuff added on the list and it makes me freaking addicted to just bam bam, you know? Like I just tick all those tasks and it's fun. &gt;&gt; How do you make that work fun and have a monster amount of focus? &gt;&gt; You and I, we've been struggling a long time for how to make work fun. The very very hardest is when you get started &gt;&gt; because there's no results. &gt;&gt; Maybe it depends also for people. For me, it really is about what people think, how people pursue my work. The fact that people like it, it gives value to my work. It makes me like, "Oh, wow. I want to do more of this." &gt;&gt; Then for people who don't have the traction yet, what how would you say &gt;&gt; exactly what I did 2022, which is like you really have to frame this work as little piece of a collection, which is your creation. Could be a website, could be videos you make, could be Instagram posture, share, whatever, or tweets. It doesn't matter if it flops. It's just you're building it. Yeah. I think at the beginning, that's how I found motivation. In the end, there's only one answer is to ship and run down to [music] taking away to the dark side. I want to be your left [singing] man. &gt;&gt; I love you when you sing. I got in [music] my life

================================================================================

This is what happened when you book an entire business class. I wake up and make stuff I'm excited about. It's an app that has access to my entire health data. And from that moment, I remember nothing. Leave like a &gt;&gt; to leave until 120 years old. There are three important parts in the workout. &gt;&gt; I spent an entire day doing nothing. All right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Then sign the deal. [Music] We leaving Korea. No. &gt;&gt; You were leaving your parents. &gt;&gt; Oh, it was so nice living with them. &gt;&gt; It was really fun. Yeah. Literally one month going back as when we were teenagers. &gt;&gt; My favorite part was eating breakfast with parents all together and we talk about life. The more I grow up, the more I appreciate family time and have a deeper connection as a same adult. And they're very supportive of what we do with this even though it's not very their world. I think we're boarding right now. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Welcome to how we on right now. Okay. Bye. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. Pokémon everywhere. Hello Pikachu. Even the wing has a samurai bird. &gt;&gt; This is what happened when you book an entire business class. [Applause] I got Alex Ori on the line. He's asking me, "How did we get so rich?" &gt;&gt; What's your favorite flight? Sorry. &gt;&gt; It's about AGI and super intelligent. It would be the biggest revolution ever. It's already here, but it's the beginning of something much bigger. Hello Mark. &gt;&gt; Hey. What's up? &gt;&gt; Do you remember this? &gt;&gt; Holy moly. That's good old times, right? &gt;&gt; Happy anniversary. It's been 8 years together. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's true. All those photo of us, we were party so hard. &gt;&gt; Do you remember him? Frank? &gt;&gt; Yeah, Frank. Of course. He let us meet. No. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was actually doing teo teo with me in Korea and in the Korean culture the you know, you go drink soju after you're done. And he's a good drinker and he made me drink some soju and I was like I just remember the dinner and then after he was like, "Hey, you know, let's go clubbing and stuff." And I know you were you and like people from the startup center were at a certain club. So we went to that club and from that moment I remember nothing. Complete blackout. &gt;&gt; So our love blew from the darkness. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a nice way to put it. Yeah, we were drunk as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; In Korea, when when we live together, we always partied, sleep at 1:00 a.m. or even later. &gt;&gt; Yeah, even later. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we always went to convenience store like eating the cheap sugary food. Our health was really, really bad back then. You could tell from the photos. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, things has been changed. I think when we started the jumping rope jute workout. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because we were very poor back then. So, we couldn't afford gym. So, we just follow the jumping rope guys free workout routine. So, we used to go to the park on the top of the mountain. &gt;&gt; And then we were so poor. I remember the breakfast we were having. We knew nuts were healthy, but also nuts are expensive. And we were sharing like 30 g of nuts. fleet into. And then we went to Bali and I think there's a second time of change because we were surrounded by all those like healthy fitness people. &gt;&gt; There was something that triggers in the brain. We're good about diets and workouts and we stopped drinking alcohol around this time, but there was still this mindset of like, oh, I got to wake up early and I got to do my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it doesn't matter if I sacrifice an hour or two of sleep because I can work harder. And I remember that costed me a burnout. Like I was not thinking clearly because I was wanting to grind more. Then I read the book and I was like, "Oh, maybe we ditch the alarm, the morning clock." And then we started to prioritize sleep again. And then we feel so much better. &gt;&gt; But still health is really hard cuz even though we do everything so well, &gt;&gt; there are some days that you feel very tired, negative. We actually track our health through oop the fitness like the health tracker. It says the record is great. my recovery is the best and I slept well but still I feel tired so I feel like there is another reason we cannot connect the dots &gt;&gt; that's kind of what I want to do with bio age I hope that eventually there are patterns between workouts food supplements and sleep and eventually you realize like oh if I eat this food too much then my sleep is disturbed and I also think there's a little bit of randomness in life we're now robots so it's also normal that days we're tired and days we're not tired &gt;&gt; well we're lucky to have each other always motivate each other to be healthier and not giving up and we are trying to find a reason together. So maybe this week we check our routine with body weight and see who is getting younger more cuz we're very competitive. So if we are playing game I think I'll be even more excited to keep up my health routine and nail it. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; What's going on? &gt;&gt; I spent the entire day making this video and I got nothing. I literally got nothing. I wasted the entire day. &gt;&gt; What kind of video? &gt;&gt; Launch video for that. &gt;&gt; What's blocking you? You couldn't find nice idea. &gt;&gt; I have beats of ideas and I cannot stitch everything together and I try different stuff and it didn't work and it was super [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So you're doing at least 10k step today to build &gt;&gt; not even that's why I run &gt;&gt; I didn't I achieved nothing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; you know all the great philosopher they had to walk to have amazing idea. So I think you're on the right track. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm far from being a great philosopher because I cannot even come up with a freaking video for it to launch. God damn it. &gt;&gt; It's time to go to bed. True. Actually, very true. &gt;&gt; 1 hour before going to bed, we wind down. &gt;&gt; I know, but I feel so guilty. &gt;&gt; It's okay. Tomorrow will be a new day. And it's better to sleep to turn off your brain so you can restart strong. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; Such a terrible day. I'll make something out of this. I'll be back tomorrow and I'll make a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] banger video and nobody will know that I spent an entire day doing nothing. But it doesn't matter because the video will be out there. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Just outcome is important. No more blue light. We're going to the cave. We always set up AC 18°, no sunlight. Wow, look at this magical room. &gt;&gt; Good night. &gt;&gt; I just woke up and for the past hour or so, I was in a weird conscious unconscious mindset. I was kind of thinking of yesterday and I think I found the video I want to make. Actually, here's a little teaser of what's coming. &gt;&gt; Straighten your back, stand tall, and walk over to her. &gt;&gt; Hi. Uh, I see you there. And I I didn't want to regret not talking to you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Why? &gt;&gt; Um, it's because, uh, I really have, &gt;&gt; Mark, open up your chest and look straight. &gt;&gt; Might be a complete flop, but I think I got something. So, I guess she was right. Sometimes you just got to let it go, turn the computer off, and start again fresh the next day. Okay, now it's time for coffee. Time to enjoy the sunrise, go to the gym, and get this done. Look at this first papaya tree of our house. Good morning. It's already time to do workout. Today Mark went to surf. So I will show you how we do training to leave until 120 years old. There are three important parts in workout. First lift the weight three to four times a week. Second run two to three times a week. Third, walk 10k steps per day. So, I'll show you how we train in daily life. Chip makes our workout routine. Usually, two times of lower body, two times of upper body. And today is shorter and chest day. So, let's train. Wait before you cannot miss coffee before workout. Drive slow. &gt;&gt; So, we just finished the workout and I'm so starving. Let's see what's in the fridge today. &gt;&gt; Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; She's taking over the YouTube channel. This used to be Mark channel. Now it's WJI channel. Da da da. The meal prep makes the life so much easier. So, we prepared all the ingredient once a week and it makes us so much easier to eat healthy because I just threw all the ingredient to the plate and change the sauce daily. One time of hard work saved the whole week. One, two, three. Tada! Lunch is ready. As a finisher, we're going to put Brian Jen, extra virgin oil, and apple vinegar cider to lower the blood sugar. Welcome to our vegan day. Every dinner with tofu, tempe, beans, and every two to three days, we eat full day of vegan meals. On the bio age, we updated the goal. Every meal we take a photo then it will calculate how much calorie, protein, carb, all those macronutrient but also the sory fat and sugar level. &gt;&gt; This app I think it's probably one of my least used app yet the one we use &gt;&gt; the most &gt;&gt; the most. &gt;&gt; Yeah, true. &gt;&gt; Every single feature added there is because you requested or I needed it. Actually that's um I think it could be an interesting topic. There are lots of people who build stuff with the intent to make money. This one is really an app made for now for us and you can tell by the landing page. It's the most anti- business landing page I've ever made. &gt;&gt; So, is it different from your previous apps? &gt;&gt; Not really in the sense that every apps I've made are apps that I would at some point need. I think it's coming from the frustration of 2018 when I was working for escape room businesses and I gave zero [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about escape rooms. like not in a bad way. The tons of problems to fix that I just don't care about and this one was one of them. And now I'm really trying to focus on building only apps that I experienced the problem. That's how she pass was born. &gt;&gt; That's how fast &gt;&gt; cuz the course I wish I had. Yeah, exactly. And then most most of the time data pass cuz I really want a a tool for me that is like my founder dashboard where I see my revenue traffic etc. And bio age now for health. I want to wake up and make stuff I'm excited about. For me, I have to care about I have to have the problem to care. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, scratch your own itch. &gt;&gt; Scratch own. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? &gt;&gt; I'm being photographed by Paparazzi in the lounge in Malik. &gt;&gt; We have something we haven't finished. &gt;&gt; Oh no. She's always competing against me. &gt;&gt; We need to see the results before going to France. &gt;&gt; Oh no. &gt;&gt; The game we started in Bali must finish in Bali. Before showing the results, can you say how hard you tried versus how hard I tried? &gt;&gt; We'll see the result first. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; I'm 18 years old, which means 15 years younger. &gt;&gt; So, actually soon I will be doing illegal stuff &gt;&gt; cuz I married a a minor. &gt;&gt; Recently, I picked up running and that really gave my cardio health like improved so much. And of course by weight helped very much. Hopefully we can see all those diet, sleep, exercise, like blood test all in one tab so that we can have a consultation with the AI. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know. I know. Like as soon as we land in France, we're going to be there for a couple of weeks. I'm going to lock the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I'll build like crazy. I'll ship like crazy. &gt;&gt; Okay, then let's go to France and make this bio happen. We're walking to the gate and we have to do our usual routine, &gt;&gt; the daily check. &gt;&gt; When we shoot the Korea vlog, it was 5,000 and we're already 6K almost. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amazing. &gt;&gt; Crazy. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You're going to eat so much. &gt;&gt; How do you feel? &gt;&gt; I'm excited to have some cheese. &gt;&gt; Cheese? You mean my saturated fat? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Look in, man. Just look the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Look at this, man. What is this doing? &gt;&gt; You know, I shipped funnels on that fast and I tested the new headline and new hero section for the entire website to convert more people. So, this is the funnel for 2 weeks before I made the change. And this is the funnel for 2 weeks after the change. The conversion rate from landing page to signing up went from 4.5% to 6.2. I completely changed the hero section and I give interactive demo and I change the entire headline. &gt;&gt; We're final in Paris. &gt;&gt; I'm building an app to leave until 120 years old. At least I hope so. The goal itself is not to leave uh super long. The goal itself is especially to have fun in this journey cuz uh being healthy makes me happy. Being happy is what I thrive for. So I'm building this little thing called bio age which uh tagline is your body's operating system. It's really work in progress. Basically it's an app that has access to my entire health data. So it knows my sleep from my wearables. It knows how much nutrients I intake through snapping photos of my food. It knows uh how well is my exercise going like um through again my wearables. It has access to my biomarkers. So I just upload blood tests here and then it extract them the important ones. And then what I hope will be the core feature of this app is the AI chat. This is basically chipt trained on my own health data as context. It knows again what I eat, what I do, how I sleep, my blood sugar, etc. And I hope that by doing so I will be able to find patterns for some reason. Maybe some days I feel like a little more tired, some days I underperform my workouts, my run, whatever. So for instance, I can ask, do I drink too much coffee? Does it seem to disturb my sleep? And then here I give this AI a bunch of tools. A tool to uh check what is my last night of sleep to uh see sleep patterns for the past 30 days to uh see if there's caffeine uh intake inside of my food intake. There really are a bunch of stuff. It's work in progress. So, as you can see, it's actually terrible. Something might have been wrong here. But I I just hope that after grinding more on this little weekend side project, I will be able to get an AI that is extremely smart, that is trained on all my health context, and able to tell me how to improve my overall health. Judg might kill my startup really soon, but hey, it doesn't matter. I'm having fun building this one, and it's all about enjoying the journey.

[Applause] This is crazy. 5.6%. &gt;&gt; I'm dying. The most painful moment of my life. If things don't change, I will just burn out. &gt;&gt; How much is our MR now? 55K, man. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I am so freaking happy. There is one biomarker to track is V2 max. Let's get a V2 max list. [Music] What is he doing? Mark, what are you doing? I thought you were working. &gt;&gt; You were waiting for that moment. I knew it. Okay, I can explain. &gt;&gt; No, you're busted, man. &gt;&gt; I have a really good excuse. I don't code anymore. AI codes for me. And when I wait for the AI to code, instead of checking my phone, I lift this dumbbell. AI is working and I am lifting. It's a new world, man. Okay. So, AI is my husband now. Okay. I think we have to go. We're about to leave. &gt;&gt; Oh, true. What time is the flight? &gt;&gt; Very soon in few hours. &gt;&gt; Okay. 5 minutes. &gt;&gt; 5 4 3 2 1 Heat. Heat. Oh wow. You can put your stuff inside. &gt;&gt; It's the seats and the luggage at the same time. Viva Korea. &gt;&gt; Viva Korea. And even we can order here. &gt;&gt; Wow. So good. Healthy veggies and protein and bar. &gt;&gt; This is the first Korean meal in the last 6 months. I think &gt;&gt; it's so good. &gt;&gt; It is so good. Yeah. I'm starving and it's hot. So hot outside. We're going to be here for 30 days. &gt;&gt; Your parents are going to take care of us like we're 12 years old. We're going to spoil what is amazing in the cell bar. You can refill all the side dishes here. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. I Korean girl. &gt;&gt; I'm getting into the Korean style with those umbrellas. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You mean you're into Korean skin care, the boy, the sunlight, sunscreen, and the sun umbrella. &gt;&gt; Brian just would be really proud of us. Everybody's wearing umbrellas here. That's true. &gt;&gt; Your parents come back from Norway &gt;&gt; and they're like, "Why are Europeans all the way at midday standing under the on the grass under the strong sun?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hey, feel free to say hi. Hi. Heat. Heat. 1 hour 20. &gt;&gt; 1 hour 20. &gt;&gt; How many kilometers? I don't know cuz it's on my I think 16 or 17 maybe. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's do 50. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. First is my teacher. &gt;&gt; I think about a month ago I wanted to start to train to the gym. And he was like, "Oh, you know, like uh if you're looking for a PT or something, just I'll train you." And he refused any financial incentives or anything. Like he's been literally training me just for free. So that's how kind people are. And we're going to now head over a little session really quick. I'm dying. This is the end. This totally the end. Yeah. one. &gt;&gt; This is horrible. I hate this. We say goodbye to &gt;&gt; He killed He killed me every single time I struggle to walk. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I saw you did all the maximum weight in the machine. &gt;&gt; He's pushing me hard, but just enough. &gt;&gt; Okay, maybe we give a little backstory. So, 30 days ago, we we arrived in Korea and I wanted to get into the gym just to see how that goes. Yeah, because you before you didn't do any weightlifting, so you wanted to learn the perfect form to prevent injuries. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. And I did ch method. So I asked GPT and YouTube videos and I think in the first session he saw me like doing whatever you know, with the weight &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so he he doesn't speak English and I barely speak any Korean, but he started to coach me the first lesson and then he's like, I can actually coach you like twice a week or something. And then in the ended up like he coached me like almost 10 times. is super kind. It's like a free PT. It's amazing. I think it's a good example of Korean people &gt;&gt; like this act of kindness that they would we offered him to pay him for his time like the PT sessions, right? &gt;&gt; He keep denying and really beautiful kindness of Koreans. &gt;&gt; So maybe let's show the results. &gt;&gt; Oh, the weight, the body weight and stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So we did the inbody test to see how much muscles and body fat you want. Can you show me? 4.5 kilogram of fat. That's crazy. You are 5.6% of body fat. Are you a bodybuilder? &gt;&gt; It's crazy, man. Do you think it's really 5.6? &gt;&gt; I mean, your skin is very lean. It shows the body fat level. &gt;&gt; Ah, maybe the the reason it's very different from bodybuilders body &gt;&gt; is because I don't have much muscles. So, it doesn't &gt;&gt; Yeah. They they have way more volume. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. New Zealand 6 months ago, body fat was 11%. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. So that means like I reduce my body fat by half. &gt;&gt; Like if I want to really get muscly, &gt;&gt; I need to eat way more. &gt;&gt; More carbs. &gt;&gt; More carbs. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz so much protein texting liver. So it's not good. &gt;&gt; But at the same time, this kind of like cardio stuff, it's better when you're not kind of lean &gt;&gt; cuz you can run longer, faster. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Uh it's kind of a in between, you know. Actually, talking about V2 max, we have to do a test, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. That was our promise. Oh, let's get a V2 max test. &gt;&gt; I think if there is one biomarker to track is V2 max. &gt;&gt; It tells how much your muscles &gt;&gt; are able to use oxygen that you breathe when you're exosing. It's a good indicators of how fit healthy you are. &gt;&gt; And it's a good predictor of how well your your heart and the rest of your body is aging. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. What is your goal then? What is a good level? &gt;&gt; I think so. Okay. So, we are kind of following Brian Johnson's routine. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; So, our kind of reference point is Brian Johnson, which I think is a 55 elite athletes or around 70 in our age. If you're above 50, I think he's really good. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, I hope we have 50 plus both of us. &gt;&gt; Uh hopefully. &gt;&gt; Hopefully. &gt;&gt; So, not only you to test, we actually did the blood test in Korea. &gt;&gt; Yeah, true. And the funny thing is because I built also apps related to health that I was like wait I need to add a feature where I can upload my blood work tests &gt;&gt; into bio age. And so this is basically how it looks. The book good energy about all the important stuff to track in your health. Those are all the biomarkers the author say to track. And so basically the feature is like you upload your lab test a PDF whatever file and it's going to extract all those bio markers and put it in the little table here give you a glimpse of how good it is for you and then you can see one column equal one lab test and you can see over the month or years how you perform and the idea the big plan is that later on I connect blood work exercise data sleep data food data basically a sort of chachi PT but trained on my own health data &gt;&gt; hopefully Anderson also use it. &gt;&gt; I think he might be working on something similar. He's big into AI and he's definitely the person to go to for when it comes to longevity. So I'm pretty sure he has something planned. &gt;&gt; So on the blood test last year I had over 300 cholesterol level but this year I reduced by half. We're working so hard for our health. So let's see what is our score for the V2 max test. &gt;&gt; Before we do the V2 text max, I cannot not see this. I I cannot talk to you while chewing gum. It's very impolite. So I had to rest my gum on myself. &gt;&gt; And in 3 seconds, me in the most painful moment of my life. &gt;&gt; Very good. view to test. &gt;&gt; I think this is where we go. &gt;&gt; Close to your heart, like right below your chest. &gt;&gt; You know, it's harder than it looks. This was the worst. &gt;&gt; This is what the wor I feel dumb. Okay. Oh, actually it's like 100k all equipment cost. So if you cannot make it, just grab the bar and then keep running and he will decrease the incline and speed. So as soon as you grab the bar, then it's &gt;&gt; okay. Game over. &gt;&gt; Actually, I was thinking my mix. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; you're like a crazy king. Looks like a picture human. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's really you breathe in. Yes. &gt;&gt; Sh. &gt;&gt; Let's start it. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now we're walking quite comfortable pace. Very rarely people make on to seven. So your goal is maybe seven. Oh, it's getting faster. 50 seconds before the stage four. working. &gt;&gt; Ah, good job. You did so well. &gt;&gt; Very good. Very good. &gt;&gt; How was it? &gt;&gt; So hard. &gt;&gt; Yeah. At the end, &gt;&gt; like my uh my brain was getting dizzy, like passing out. &gt;&gt; I think we're not used to climb &gt;&gt; like this. And it's just a killer. So hard. &gt;&gt; And also I don't know maybe cuz I have a massive nose but it presses here. So I end up breathing only with my mouth. &gt;&gt; Ah &gt;&gt; you couldn't breathe with the nose. &gt;&gt; Always the first thing is better to be low so you can see the improve it. &gt;&gt; Yay. Always find the positive side. &gt;&gt; Results in 3 2 1. &gt;&gt; We got the result. What is your view to mix? &gt;&gt; 57. &gt;&gt; Wow. That's so nice. your top three% of the male &gt;&gt; max economy. &gt;&gt; It's a estimated record of your current like a capability to mix and everything. So it looks very nice. &gt;&gt; I could make a marathon in less than 3 hours. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. This &gt;&gt; Wow, it changed. &gt;&gt; This is super interesting. &gt;&gt; We have a theory for this &gt;&gt; is because smartphones people look down so they don't cross the road when it's red. &gt;&gt; I mean, it makes so much sense though like when I see people they all look at their phone like or look at the floor &gt;&gt; and Korea must protect this citizen to compensate with &gt;&gt; population. So, we need to save one more young people. &gt;&gt; Yeah, true. By the way, we haven't done it yet. &gt;&gt; Our daily routine. &gt;&gt; The new daily routine. &gt;&gt; Are you going to check now? &gt;&gt; Should I? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Was it? How much is our MR now? &gt;&gt; Oh No. We were checking data first MR every day when we walk at the end of the day and we're like, "Oh, when do we get 5K?" Because this is very like &gt;&gt; where I spend the last 9 months of my life working on this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wow. Finally 5K man. &gt;&gt; Which means I have to run 5K. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. So Mark will run 5K, 6K, 7K whenever he reach those stage. So &gt;&gt; that's no good. I prefer the 5K MR than the 5K run. I think it's time to get the out of here until people think we're weird YouTubers. Finally, $5,000 monthly recurring revenue for Delafast. And I am so freaking happy. The reason is about 3 months ago, I think it was around May. I was wondering if things don't change, if it doesn't grow a little faster, that I might have to move on because I will just burn out. Cuz I literally spent a year working on Dataf Fast and I felt like it was really slow. The churn was high, the revenue was not growing crazy, but then luckily something happened. So I talked about that in my previous video how this little uh public map globe of uh visitors on site created a little sort of like network effect. It gave customers something to share on social media which get them attention and at the same time it would bring some people to datafast which would grow a little uh customer base. Then around 2 months ago, I started to redesign completely the onboarding for data fast cuz I realized lots of people actually just signed up but never created a website and so I changed the entire onboarding and I learned a lot of stuff. I'll drop a link to a little free article I wrote on my newsletter uh where you can dig into everything I learned. Uh on boarding is very important because that's how you get people from just being uh curious about your product to being interesting and having their attention. And then finally, I think because of the recent feature I shipped, which is especially this one, the funnel part where uh people can see like how people move from steps to step in their the journey for whatever they're trying to achieve. It helps people find bottlenecks and it position data fast not just as uh a nice to have analytics tool, but as a way to find bottlenecks inside of people's marketing funnel. For instance, one thing that I've learned uh this is datafast funnel uh on datafast and it's basically the scroll uh depth of datafast. So that's how far people scroll on my landing page on datafast landing page. And I just saw that uh around 60% of people never even scroll past the hero section. They land on the site and they just drop off right away. So this was a very like huge insight for me and I as well for some customers which I think is one of the reason why datafas grew and what I'm doing right now is because of this number exactly this number precisely this one I am a little frustrated uh so I'm trying to change the hero section of data fast I have a feeling I could write something much better here some people say it's generic so right now I'm focusing more on the marketing side and especially on the literally like the front page the landing page of data fast also I have been working on this very very long series of videos. I will only release that if I actually manage to grow data fast to a million dollar in valuation, which is around $25,000 in monthly recurring revenue. I'm extremely far from being there. But if it happens, if I ever reach my goal, uh I will have all those uh videos uh that I can share that I literally go from whatever kinds of emotion from day I think day one, day two, whatever until uh what whatever date it is now, I think day 331. So that would make an interesting video and I will only get there if I ship a lot of stuff. So now it's time to get back to coding.

TITLE: I Tried a Strange Marketing Trick and Made $___
VIDEO ID: r45n3Jsqu6o
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r45n3Jsqu6o
================================================================================

So, this is the dumbest marketing experiment I've tried. This is my t-shirt. On the back, there is a cure code. When people scan it, they go to my website and if they buy my product, I make money. Well, that's the perfect plan. So, I just wore this t-shirt and travel the world. I wore it in the busy streets of Mumbai. I wore it in shopping malls in Singapore in the plane. People stared, people laugh. One guy took a selfie with me and run away. At some point, I just became a walking ad and the sidewalk was my funnel. The real question is, can this dumb ideal actually make money? First, I had to pick the right product. I have built over 30 businesses. Some are SAS, some are marketplaces, and some were built during a personal crisis. But most of them don't make money. So, I picked Codefast, my course that teaches people how to learn how to code. Because it has lots of positive reviews, because it converts well, and because it has a broad audience. A random tourist in Paris is more likely to want to learn how to code than reduce Stripe chargebacks. Then, I had to create the cure code. I made a link that points to my course with a little tracking tag at the end. That way, I could use datafast to see exactly who scanned it, how long they stayed, and if they actually bought my course. Datafast is like Google Analytics except that it doesn't require a PhD to understand. I added some text to the cure code because when you tell people not to do something, they usually do it. And then I slap the image on a custom t-shirt. In Indonesia, it only costs $10 to create those custom shirts, but I made a mistake and I just ordered one. At this point, I had the product, I had the funnel, I just had to do marketing. So, I went to Singapore. I walked through a mall, train station. I even went to the Apple store because if someone spent $3,000 on the laptop, they might as well spend $200 for a course. And nothing happened. Not a single visitor. Maybe scanning a stranger's back is not a thing after all. So, I went to India. Totally different vibes. People were curious, friendly. Some even asked for selfies. I walked through Lindmark, food markets, pack street, and people scanned. A lot of people scanned. And that's when I realized two things. Number one, I should have printed more than one t-shirt, especially in a tropical weather of Mumbai. And number two, the funnel was broken. I wasn't a guy promoting a product anymore. I had become an ad that does not convert. I had to increase the conversion rate. So, I snapped a photo of me, removed the background, and with a little bit of code, I added a pop-up to the site only for people who scan with a cure code. The idea was to make people feel like this page was built just for them. I hope this would change that. So I flew to France, walked 20,000 step, got many people scanning me and still no sales. If you want people's attention, pay for it. So I decided to run ads, my kind of ads. I would give people $1 so they can scan my back and I would pitch my product. I made a cardboard and traded my bills for coins. I carried everything to the EFL Tower and it felt awkward. People stared, but no one scanned. probably because scam me really looks like scam me or probably because my shirt says the exact opposite of what the cardboard says. So I started talking first, waving the coin and smiling and suddenly people started scanning and for $1, I got to pitch my product. I talked to tourists, families and even a smart kid with this moment and most of them were German. I have no idea why and I watch it happen on real time on data fast. People scanning me and lighting up the globe. After two hours, I gave away all my coins and then suddenly where someone what the here yolo yolo I saw one sale $299. Yes, I did it. But then I remembered I tweeted a photo of myself at the EFL Tower earlier that day and the person bought under a company name. So I had no way to trace back to a person I talked to. It could have been Twitter and not the street. Suddenly I felt like the whole challenge was broken. In the taxi to go back home, I had mixed feelings. The driver noticed the cardboards in my hand and asked what we were doing in Paris. We chatted for a bit, and when we arrived home, he asked if he could check the course. He scanned my bag, read the landing page, pulled his credit card, and right in front of me, he bought it. He's from Benin, Africa. He drives a taxi in Paris, where running a pork farm back home, and he wants to build a website to sell the meat online. That was the moment. I thought that tweet ruined everything, but I wasted weeks on a challenge that would never work. But the taxi made it real again. Don't wait for everything to be perfect. Just put your work out there. It might be awkward. It might flop. And then out of nowhere, it might just work.

[Music] To make $1 million in profit, you need $1.2 million in revenue with the digital product. And you need 20 million in revenue with the restaurant. This is where I'm going to lock in gym code. Gym code review. We should have used typescript. There has never been a better time in history to build digital products. Let's shoot. This ad is so good. Time for serious business. What if I die? Just shoot it. Meet Mark Lou, a millionaire who owns exactly zero pairs of shoes and way more startups than you'd think is reasonable. He sits here in this disgustingly beautiful tropical paradise to show you how to turn ideas into brands, strangers into clients, and your boring job into a distant memory. 5 4 3 2 1. So, we're on the way to the next Airbnb and we're sad to leave especially. Yeah, it was such a beautiful place. Oh, wow. The bridge is built. That's unreal color. Which direction are we going? Are we going this way or or that way? I'm I'm not so sure which way we're going. Baboo. So healthy. We bought the salmon from the mom cook. 500 g. Lots of protein. Feels so muscle. All right, so we just landed in a new place in New Zealand. We're lost in the middle of absolutely nowhere, which I guess is good because there's no other distraction than this as I have a brand new feature I need to ship for data fast. So I guess this is where I'm going to lock in gym code gym code repeat. So this is what we're going to do. You're the coach today. There's no surf in New Zealand where we are. So, this is the first time doing a crossfit session with a wife. Go. There's no legacy if I drop this. Oh, no. Oh, it's hard. It's just a momentum and skill. Yeah, I didn't get it. Time to code. We are going to take a killer thumbnail for the New Zealand vlog and we are going to move this swing to the middle of the road. It's not a bad office. I just wish I could see something on my screen. I'm going to get cancelled. Okay, look at that. Wow. 200 g grass-fed beef from New Zealand. They have the best life until they got eaten by him. So good. Oh, we catch this little bird. She came through the window. It's like a little indie hiker just starting the journey and we want to wish him good luck. Just ship it. Ah, she stays here. Maybe she loved us. Bye-bye, pretty bird. It's 1000 p.m. There's absolutely no one around and we can see all the stars. It is so beautiful. Time to go to bed. Good morning. It is Sunday morning and there's nothing I like better than a coffee and a book. This is what I am reading at the moment. The breakthrough experience. Usually I have this approach for hopefully almost everything where it's either a hell yeah or no. So if I uh really like the book then I'm going to keep reading. If it's meh then I'm just going to go for another book. This one I don't know. I still really don't know. But at the same time I'm like just keep digging. I guess if it makes it in another video then it's probably a hell yeah book. Good Good Good [Applause] Breakfast time. The point when you move airplanes too often you find so much time opening 2 hours straight. You're dirty. Daily workout with the wife. Let's go. Do you think anyone? 30 minutes of workout per day, 30 minutes of coding, 30 minutes of marketing. Do this every single day of the year in 2025 will be freaking amazing. New Zealand is so beautiful. A man, this ad is so it's so good. I was bored today and I didn't want to code. So instead, I made an ad and I used AI for that. So here's the thing. A couple days ago, I saw this ad on Instagram. Like literally, it was in my feed. It's a it's a French dude who is promoting his restaurants and I was like, "This is a really good ad." And it's also extremely simple to make. You just need an iPhone to record that. And so I try to make the same thing for my ad. Let me show you what I come up with. People always ask me, "Hey Jordan, how do you invest your money?" I don't know. My name is not even Jordan, it's Mark. But what I know is this. The best investment you can make is learn how to code and build your own tiny internet business. And now with AI, it's easier than ever. So check out codefast.no and start coding today. This literally took 45 minutes to make because I already know like this ad format works. It's a very simple script. I use AI to rewrite the initial script. So I I took the script from that Instagram ad. I put it to AI. I describe the product I'm selling. And then I asked the AI to keep the same short format and write it for my own product. Then I asked my wife to shoot me and do my weird stuff. And I use this little u website here um Sub Magic. You just upload your video and then they add those uh like sexy thumbnails onto your video which make it more dynamic. I think this is for Instagram so it needs to move a little bit. And now I'm I'm lucky that I have a good friend of mine, Nico. You might have seen him in some of my previous videos. He's also an indie hacker. He used to manage um high budget, not like mine, like really high budget uh ads for like software and stuff. So he's really good at it and he's going to help me like with the targeting on Facebook and Instagram to make sure that you know the ad is seen by the right people. If that works, I will just report in those videos what I get from those ads. I really had no idea that today would be an ad day. I really don't like marketing. But when it becomes fun like this where it's like a very short tiny thing, I make a video that is hopefully fun. I come up with like weird ideas. One point here is if you ever see an ad that looks fun and it's quite easy to make, try to replicate that ad. Use the format they use because if you're seeing the ad, it means they're spending decent money. So it means that the ad somehow is working. take that ad, ask the AI to make the copyrightiting and the part that you you don't know and try to sell it somewhere on Instagram, Facebook, or just post the video on your own Instagram and see how that goes. A nice uh time for serious business. Today is a little bit of a special day. Not only because this is probably one of the most beautiful place I've ever stayed, but also because what if I die? Like I'm French and my company is in Singapore. I have a local director and there's a little over a million dollar in cash in the company. How do I make sure that my wife gets everything if something happened to me? So, I'm doing some boring legal stuff, but uh now I have my friend Chajipy who is going to I guess make my life much easier. In Singapore, company shares do not automatically transfer to a spouse upon death. Instead, they're handled through succession, laws, a will, and legal documents. I get some paperworks, I guess. Okay, I guess I uh I found this um this lawyer company or whatever this is. They have a little button to message them on WhatsApp, which is something I love about Asia. You can do everything on WhatsApp. I send them a a WhatsApp and uh I mentioned the fact that I want my wife to own everything if something happens to me. I know this is kind of an awkward question, but I was thinking I've been working hard for six years to create this thing and my wife has been my co-founder somehow. Like mentally, she's been here all the time. And I think she deserves to get every single beats that's left if I were to disappear. And I want to make sure that there's no friction for her to get it like having to fight in court or something like this. That took me 5 minutes. Uh maybe that will take me another 30 minutes later and probably cost me $1,000 worth of lawy lawyer things, but at least I know that if anything happens, she has some sort of peace and will get all the rewards of, you know, all the things she's been she's been through because I would have never be able to make any of this without my wife. Um a No, but actually I'm a bit emotional at the moment. Oh, I think that's so good. It almost looks like it's a bye-bye, you know, like no, you're not going to die tomorrow. No, we'll sign a contract with a lawyer that says, you know, if anything happens, you will get everything of the company. Doesn't happen. Oh, no. Thank you for doing it just in case. You know, we never know, man. I'm just walking down the street and then there is one of those seagull who on me. He goes into my eyes, he gets infected. Boom. Death. All right. I don't really feel like working at the moment. So, why not taking a day off and enjoy this beautiful view? It's going up now. Woke up in a country lane. Don't know what happened. I don't know how I came to be at the end of my world with going up in smoke. Just watch your bra. Hey, you say all things don't go my way. Get me. All I have to do today is to build a bunch of features user requested. Life doesn't get any better than that. Yes, this is the best time of the day. I think I shipped around six features all requested by my customers. That's very important. Let me show you this. This is it. Those like this little card here is where I display all the new features that I've shipped on the app. And um most of them come from this one. So, I collect feedback from my customers. And one of the most requested feedback was I want to exclude renewal revenue from uh my metrics. So first thing what I did is I now split the revenue into two categories. The new revenue and the recurring revenue usually coming from subscriptions or recurring customers. And so it's quite subtle but the color like there's different shades of orange here to uh differentiate which is new which is renewal. And then I've created a little setting where people can turn off these like renewal uh revenue included into their KPIs. And so this revenue per visitor will include or not include the recurring revenue. And because shipping is fun, I also include in refunds. So um now in gray color, uh if like a payment was refunded, then it's going to be shown in gray. And the revenue will of course not be included in the revenue per visitor. And finally, the last update I made, I think this one is more for me. Um I was really curious what happens when people visit my site but don't purchase on the first day. For instance, for this person, I know that they found my website through Beehive, so likely my newsletter, and they did not make a purchase on the day they viewed the site. And I was really curious like when they make a purchase or the next days, where do they find my site? Do they click a tweet? Do they click do they go on Google? Whatever. And now I can see I added like this little line where I can see the new referral. And so now I know that this person found through my newsletter on the first day. And then when he they came back by typing codefast on Google. If you're a user of datafast, I hope you'll like this new update. We're going from Christ Church to Timaru. In Christ Church, we're so busy we couldn't make much YouTube video. Instead, you made like masterpiece. Is it a masterpiece? I hope so. So, what is that video? It's one of the questions people ask me the most often is like, how would you learn to code again now that there is AI? This is kind of like the road map I had for codefast. It's like I highlight to you all the steps you need to go from zero to coding a SAS and coding faster with AI. And uh it's about 3 hours long, but the comments people who watch this videos like they it's extremely helpful and man that's that's it goes straight to my heart because I spent so much time making this video. I'm very happy that it's helpful and some people watch it and you know learn how to cook with it. This is the video Mark was working on for how long? 3 weeks. 3 weeks. So basically the video is it walks you through the first step which is like understanding how the the internet works the fundamentals. Then we go through building an entire software from zero. So complete beginner teaching the basics of like what is an API, what is front end, what is a back end, how do you make a landing page, how to create a dashboard, what is a database and then the end of the video is mostly how I use AI to code faster. Definitely if you want to learn code just check it out like in 3 hour you can learn everything what you need to learn. I'll put it in the card. This is a really beautiful place. I think I want this in our house. So, does it make you creative? This makes me creative. What did you find? This I was stuck. I think I found something. I want to know what you think. The thumbnail for the video like I use the movie split different personality like seven versions of me. When you click, there's like 5 to 10 seconds of play and you're like playing the movie Split and then after a little glitch and be like, "All right." And then explain the video like intro. Like maybe there could be like a programmer that is worried that AI is going to replace them and there's another programmer who's like uh not at all like you know that doesn't make any sense. I want to play those two characters. I think I found it. I found it. This will be the background. Okay. We have to make sure we leave this Airbnb and publish this video after the host reviewed us. Otherwise they will be like who the are those weirdos? All right. So I I uh ditched the previous book. Sorry Mr. de Martin, but I just I don't know. I didn't connect and I started this new book, The Expectation Effect. This is a book that was recommended on Twitter from Alex, a really good guy. His entire Twitter account is dedicated to recommending books that he loves. And uh this is excellent. It's fun because I've read just one page and I knew instantly that this was a book for me. It's hard to explain why, but it was like a clear yes. This is probably we are this house we have been everything is super old. You have this like savana animal. I need to show other weird stuff. This I mean it's not weird in itself. It's just weird as a part of this Airbnb where you have like spiritual stuff, old stuff, new stuff. Like inside you have this thing. I mean to be honest, yeah, there I want to remember those moments. Oh wow. Oh wow. So beautiful. I want to take a photo. Okay, we have to take a photo of this. So over the rain. This is the thumbnail I was working on yesterday. I hope it was worth it. And today is a video recording day. This uh video should be on YouTube a week before or after this vlog. I hope you like the video, too. Let's shoot. Bro, stop coding. What? AI is getting so good. They they they say it's going to replace us. Replace us. We've built an entire company just using AI. Customer support for Startup 13. How can I help you today? Why does everything has to be blue? And someone delete the fishing email. We are so screwed here. We don't offer refunds. I'm sorry. We need to change the border radius here. We We should have used TypeScript. Hello. Boom. Oh no, guys. We need a meeting right now. Did AI just turned me into a manager? Let there be guitar. All right, boy. Let there be rock. Let there be coffee. New Zealand is so beautiful. It's crazy. It's really beautiful. Like even the sunrise, this just the sun itself is is beautiful. This is very interesting. It's a study about the effect on placeos on relieving Parkinson disease. And it's really fun to see that the price of the drug people will pay to be healed will impact how they will be healed. It basically says that the higher they pay for the the peel, the higher the results they will get, which is really fun cuz it's super tied to what we do. I think I see a lots of developers often making this mistakes of pricing their products too cheap. Um, when you're getting started, I know it's tricky to ask for people money on the internet, but it's very important to price accurately because just the price itself without even seeing the product reflects on how good people will think the product is. It's called perceived value and unlike the actual product where it needs a lot of work, you can just, you know, increase just a little bit your pricing to make it seems like it's a better product. Of course, the product after has to deliver the value, but uh it's usually a mistake that I see developers make by pressing a little too cheap when they're getting started. And if you have no idea how to start with your pricing, the best is to look at what competitors are doing and price just a little higher or look at other industries and applies what they do for yours. Back to this masterpiece. What are you reading? The same book as you. Do you like it so far? I absolutely loved it because life is all about dealing with expectation to yourself to the other. Same as atomic habit. If you make the identity that you believe who you are, then you will behave in certain way to do so. Even though you're not the person yet, if you believe like you're a good entpreneur, you're a good runner, you're a good, you know, friend, then you will do your best to, you know, be become like that. If you're not inspired after this pep talk. All right, that's enough for today. Uh, this is a really good book. Now, time for workout luggage packing and we are going to a new place where there some workout is the second best legal drug on the planet after sleep. Take one dose daily. Side effect might include occasional flexing in the mirror. It's 9:20 a.m. 22 minutes of a heavy workout, intense workout, and I'm set for the day. Airbnb check out is in 20 minutes. And uh on the road again. The best electronic backpack no one talks about. Getting dirty. This is so heavy. Making YouTube videos is a workout. Let's go. We're finally arrived. Finally. Here we go, mate. Let's see what color it is. Yes, sir. Surprise. Wow, we just entered the paradise. Welcome Denmark. Okay, I think this is the most unexpected like out of what we are normally used to Airbnb. Okay, are you ready? Just look around. Just look around. Wow, the view. Every morning we're going to have coffee while watching this amazing view. I feel like I'm in an old man's house. And this is such a dream. Imagine you have a little door that leads to the ocean. Yeah. So nice. There are seals everywhere. Yeah, exactly. This is so nice. Yeah, this one looks dead. There are like one that I freaking love nature. It's so beautiful. That's true. It makes me so happy to be next to them. I think we can also walk on the rings later when it's low tide. She was scratching her head. Yeah. With her weird like legs. Oh, actually they don't do Careful. breakfast. All right. Oh, it's time to get some work done. And today I'm doing my favorite activity of the year, accounting. But I'm not doing the accounting myself. Uh I have an accountant doing it for me. I'm just reviewing the profit and loss statement, making sure that uh everything is right. My P&amp;L should be somewhere around this video. It's in Singapore dollars. It's the total revenue for all of my sources of income. I think I have somewhere around like 10 sources of income in total. And when doing the P&amp;L, I was surprised that the revenue is around I think $1.5 million in Singapore dollars. And the profit was 1.2 Singapore and Singapore dollars, which is around 80% profit margin. And I'm not the type of guy who cut corners. So I I am really easy peasy on the bills and stuff. I don't try to save money. I try to make more money instead. So I could optimize those profit margin. And I was still thinking 80% profit margin knowing that I have no meetups. I have uh no ownership. I don't owe anything to anyone. I'm not renting a place. I don't manage um employees. I don't have like payrolls at the end of the year or something. And that made me think of a little story back in 2016 when I was working as a waiter. I was earning around $10 per hour and I was working 10 hours a day. So, at the end of the day, I would be paid $100 and I would bring to the business around $2,000. I know that because at the end of the day, we had to count all the bills and tell the business owner how much money uh we made on the day. And back in that restaurant, there were around five waiters at a time. And so I was thinking like this business owner sells around $10,000 per day worth of food. Of course, there's ingredient, the rental, the cook to pay. But I was still thinking like that's around $300,000 per month or $3.6 million per year. This guy, the owner, might be freaking rich. I really wanted to know how much money he makes by the end of the year. But because we were in France, it's kind of like it's it's a bit of a taboo topic. You don't ask someone how much money you're making. So I tried to ask without asking and he told me it's not what do you think it is. I never really understood until today where I asked Chadip what is the average profit margin for a restaurant and I figured out that if he wants to make the similar amount of money that I made in 2024 with a restaurant you need to make $20 million. And here I am with my little $1.5 million in revenue. Those two businesses are making the same profit by the end of the year. And on top of that, there's no risk that one of my employee cuts his finger while cutting a piece of meat. I'm not going to injure typing on my keyboard. And this made me realize that for the same output, the input is completely different. To make $1 million in profit, you need $1.2 million in revenue with the digital product, and you need 20 million in revenue with the restaurant. For instance, this little product made $15,000 last year. It cost around $2 to $3 a month to send emails and it runs for like $10 a month. So that's roughly 95% profit margin. Or you can create a product with the name poop in it makes a couple hundred a month and this cost $0 a month to maintain. Or this little software that makes $2,000 a month and it cost less than $10,000 to run per month. So roughly all of my tiny software product have around 95% profit margin. And on top of this, I don't need to do much customer support. My products are running 24/7. The take away from this is profit is not revenue. And with a digital product, you don't need to hit crazy numbers in order to pay for your living. And now it has never been a better time in history to build something. With AI coming up with great marketing ideas, helping you coding and build those products. Now is the time. Or be like this guy and don't give a about life in whatsoever way. It's working. Oh, he's it like this. Is what a sea seal looks like. And this is a post face. Yes. Relieved. Yes. So relieved.

TITLE: How I use AI to build startups 10X FASTER
VIDEO ID: fFzcL6Ivqz0
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFzcL6Ivqz0
================================================================================

bro stop coding what AI is getting so good they they they say it's going to replace us replace us we've built an entire company just using AI customer support for startup 13 how can I help you today why does everything has to be blue and someone clicked the fishing email we are so screwed we we don't offer refunds I'm sorry we need to change the Border radius here we we we should have used typescript hello boom no no guys we need a meeting right now did AI just turn me into a manager AI is not going to replace us AI is going to make it easier for us to replace everyone else so I'm going to show you in this video how I use AI to code 10x faster first I'm going to show you how I set up my code editor then I am going to show you how I use AI because uh I have built 30 startups using AI 80% of my code is returned by an AI and I also use it for advanced stuff like high level thinking and design and finally I'm going to give you a few tips on how to get the most out of a okay so I use cursor AI as my code editor and that's the only place I do AI stuff I don't use lovable I don't use V I only use cursor I am using the llm clo 3.5 Sunnet at the moment it's really good for every task it's pretty fast I love it and I also have Specific Instructions that I give cursor so in cursor settings cursor settings there is a part that's called rules for AI this is where I instruct the AI exactly how I want it to behave and if for some reason the AI results are not really good then I keep refining the rules for the AI until it trained perfectly on my preferences it is specific for my text tag but if it helps I'm going to copy past this into the description of this video okay now as I said I use AI for absolutely everything from just writing one line of code to having an entire brainstorm about the project architecture and so I've divided this in a few uh categories the first one inline and this is where you press comment K and you can uh write any instruction here I use that usually when I want to do a little fix in C CS so I'm using Tailwind CSS and it's really good at making Tailwind CSS classes from scratch like specific classes another uh feature I really love is when I copy an SVG from an HTML page and I want to turn it into a valid jsx for react uh this is actually just the perfect way to do it I find these uh inline instructions to be faster than the chat so uh whatever it does not need any specific context uh then I will just use this in line instructions all right one of the core feature is the chat so this little thing here that pops up on the right side when you press Comm L I barely use it for coding because I find it kind of boring to always have to all the time uh scroll through the entire stuff apply to uh the code and then check that it was actually added to the code I feel like it's taking time sometimes you make mistakes when it applies the changes so I used the chat mostly for high level thinking um for instance this is one of my uh project where I collect feedback from customers and um the more up votes it gets the higher the post is supposed to go now based on who created the post is it a regular user is it something that was created a long time ago or is it created recently uh there are a bunch of ways to sort those posts not just by uh the actual number of votes but by many other criterias and this is just like a little side project of one of my projects it would take me so much time to come up with a great algorithm so I would use the chat in order to give a few information like hey I want to change how those post are sorted like a don't code but just suggest like the architecture or how we can Implement that I give some of the instructions I want and usually it come up with um sometimes it's not the final results come up with really good ideas and then I mix match this and what I want to apply and then eventually I come up with proper instructions so I can code it later another excellent way to use the chat is to chat with the entire code base we're going to talk about context later uh but things like is there any way to make my API endpoint more secure is there any flaw inside of my API endpoint some sometimes there are days where I create like five or 10 API endpoints and uh it's it could be kind of easy to m one line to check if the user has a proper session or something uh thei is just so good at code reviewing to make sure that I ship my apps with less bugs okay whenever I need the AI to write code for me which is 90% of the case I use the composer uh the composer you can pop it up using command I and then it looks like the chat but it's actually a composer and normally if you see it's a composer there will be written agent here so it's an actual agent uh you can do stuff like uh go on the web and search for documentation but the reason I like it the most is because you don't have to apply the results it's basically like a smart AI that is going to try to apply what you said see if it works and then come back and keep changing until it works as expected so if it needs to create a new file if it needs to install a library you can run your terminal is going to update the files Etc and I just wait do nothing for a few seconds and then he came up with normally something that is pretty good usually the better the instructions I give which I usually get from the chat the better the results I'll get with the composer um I'm shooting this on February 21st 2025 I don't know when this video goes out I don't know what's going to happen with AI but one of my guess is that this will get un better and better it will get so good at some point that it will test itself it will have like a place where you can check if the changes were updated correctly like a sendbox an environment and update the results automatically until it's exactly what the instructions said it should be doing and finally my favorite feature by far is design uh I know there are a bunch of tools out there like versal vzer lovable bolt Etc I don't use any of this because I want my code Editor to design for me because it knows my code base it knows how I name my files it knows my color palette I want cursor to design for me and guess what this is actually possible so what I do when I want a new design um I would go to a popular website and I will pick the components I'm searching so in this case I'm looking for a search bar um I like this little search bar here so I'm just going to take a screenshot of it and then inside of cursor you can just drag and drop the image and you can just ask cursor to recreate this component and make it work with your API endpoint and so this is a very dirty prompt I I really didn't didn't spend time working on this one it was just about this video uh but I actually check it out and it is working if I search for sales so of course the design here is not very beautiful because well I didn't give any instructions but I would normally put it I don't know where somewhere on the top left but it's actually working this is crazy it even have a little effect of like this is just crazy it adapted these components that I found from Material UI to my website so those are my colors those are my borders those are the the the constraint the designs constraint I use for all of my other uh components and so crazy because the agent actually couldn't find everything like it struggled with something and then it fixed itself for some reason and then it created the actual components the API endpoint the CSS animations effect like this is honestly it feels like cheating it's crazy garbage in garbage out as the same goes in AI so here are some tips I use to get the best results with AI first is about naming everything uh actually in programming naming is the hardest thing to do you want your files you want your API input point you want your components to be named in a way that is easy for you and an AI to understand for instance for all of my projects every time I have a react component that is a button that's a physical button then I will name it first button and then the second part will be like for instance if this is button to delete a post is going to be called button delete post then the variables I create inside of the button are also uh very explicit so it's easy to understand that this is a Boolean because it's has is and loading because likely it's going to call an API end points is going to be loading all of my API end points are also explicit so for instance for/ API bu/ search I know that I am going to be searching for p this is really good because it helps the AI come up with better results because it understand your code base more easily tips number two is about the context what information do you give to the AI this is probably the actually the most important because the more context you give the better the results you'll get in my case it's kind of easy because I have built over 30 websites and I always always reuse the exact same code base so my tailin CSS classes are the same my components are all the same my text Act is exactly all the same and I just clone my codebase and then the AI already has foundation so it can easily uh build stuff on top of it and whatever it's going to come up with will be likely a good fit for the actual project if you don't have a code base if you don't have context what I recommend is you is use one of those like a lovable VZ bolt Tools in order to come up with your first initial code base build a project with it and then reuse that every single time for all of your ongoing projects and finally uh the rule of 820 it's again uh February 2025 right now ai is generating about 80% of my coding outputs but I still spend around 20% of my time uh reviewing the code that has been made by the AI and tweaking uh the little details until it gets better there has never been a better time in history to build a sci project now you see you have an AI that can code for you super fast that can help you with like high level architecture design Etc but now ai can also help you with like legal stuff if you need to open a company it can help you with uh gener smart marketing ideas it can help you uh right content for internet it can also help you come up with creative thumbnail like the one you saw and clicked so use AI all the time now you can build a oneperson company with hundreds of AI agents to help you with absolutely everything until the next video I hope you keep shipping this is the thumbnail I was working on yesterday I hope you was worth it

TITLE: Learn to Code in 3 Hours, Not 3 Years (Free Course)
VIDEO ID: QD50Pkf0Ov0
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD50Pkf0Ov0
================================================================================

AI won't replace programmers but rather make it easier for programmers to replace everyone else when I learned to code in 2016 I didn't even know where to start I ended up buying courses on Udi but I almost gave up because it was so long and boring so in 2018 I ditched all the theory and instead build tiny internet businesses now in 2025 I have built 28 website and I know earned $1.2 million per year as a solo developer if I had to learn how to code again I would do it completely differently so in this video I'm going to show you the exact road map to go from complete beginner to knowing how to code fast using AI okay so this is the entire road map we're going to go through it's divided into three parts the first one is important you stick with me even though people make mistake and skip it it's the fundamentals of the internet if you want to understand how to use AI to code fast you need to understand how things work so you know what to tell the AI you know what to search when you're stuck in the second Park we're going to build a software business from scratch I'm going to show you the tools I use to build my own software business I'm going to show you how to set up your computer we're going to talk about front end backend API databases we're going to send emails we're going to process payments and all the things you need to set up a business on the internet and finally we're going to talk about how to use the AI modern AI Tools in order to 10x your development process and code even faster in the first part we're going to cover the fundamentals of the internet we're going to understand what it means for you as a developer to build an app that could be seen by millions of people across the world it is very important that you stick with me for this part because later you'll see that 80% of your work will be done by an AI and you just have to tell the AI what you want but for that you need to understand how things work you need to understand the foundation of the internet so first we're going to understand how the internet work as a consumer you right now watching this video we are browsing hundreds of websites per day so you want to understand what actually happens when you go to a website for that you can just open chpt and ask chpt or whatever AI you're using to explain what happens when you visit a website you want to mention that they should not explain using technical skills you want to use like metaphors and things that are very simple for you to understand first and here chpt is doing actually a pretty good job at explaining it Compares um searching for a website on the internet to sending a letter uh to the post office try to have like a little image in your mind of what is going on when you visit a website when this is done learn the fundamental concept of the internet so go back to chpt and ask chpt uh to explain the same thing the same Journey but instead this time not using a metaphor but using the actual terms that developers use htps uh URLs DNS Etc there are seven terms that I think are important for you to know you don't need to know everything about it but just try to have a a clear understanding of what each of those is doing as a quick example this is me going to YouTube in New Zealand and this is what the journey looks like I'm on my internet browser and I search for youtube.com so I'm considered as the clients when I press enter my request is sent to my Wi-Fi and then it goes basically on the internet the internet is is basically like a collection of uh devices that are somewhere across the planet you have DNS you have servers you have a bunch of things and the role of the internet is to find the right recipient for my request so in my case since I'm searching for youtube.com it search for the YouTube server the server is basically like a big online computer that is somewhere on the planet likely in the United States in the case of YouTube and this server is going to receive my request and then he's going to send me back an HTML uh page using the same route that it took to come to the server so it's going to go back to the DNS and the servers that are on the internet and then it going to come back to my computer and then my internet browser Safari Google Chrome whatever is going to take this HTML page and display it so that I can actually see the YouTube homepage as a consumer and now to jump to the next part you can do something interesting you can open the developer console search for your developer console so here developer tools it's called on Google Chrome um and you can see on the right side I have a bunch of stuff that might look like foreign language for you right now now but it's going to become much more clear soon um and we see that I have this like um a body and head and HTML now if I go to Reddit homepage and I open the developer console again you see that I have this HTML head and body thing again H that is quite interesting actually here what is going on is that everything on the internet that Transit whenever you're browsing as a consumer you get HTML pages and what you see here in the console HTML head and body is basically the structure of an HTML page a web page and so after this part you will understand that your job as a developer is to build web pages and put them somewhere on the internet so that millions of people can access it across internet so let's build your first web page as a developer we're entering the second phase now you need first to install a code editor so there are two popular ones and actually many others but there is a visual studio code and you have also corser AI be honest both are very similar it really doesn't matter which one you choose both support AI features I think cursor AI are the moment I'm making this video has a plan for like $20 per month to have the AI features and vs code has a free plan for their uh GitHub copilot AI feature once you picked your code editor just open it and create a new file usually you can go to help and type file and you will see like new text file now we're going to write your first web page remember everything that Transit on the internet whether you're going to Facebook Google Instagram no matter what is a web page so for that we need to know what is the default structure of a web page and so here our best friend is chpt so it can just say what is the default structure of an HTML page and then it's going to send you back a similar piece of code just copy that code and go back to your code editor and past it there then press command s to save the file and you can name it no matter what you want I'm going to call it homepage and then make sure you keep the HTML at the end because a web page is a file so it needs an extension just like MP4 is used for uh videos PNG is used for images HTML is used for web p pages so you can name it the what whatever you want just add. HTML you'll see that the structure of an HTML page is always the same it starts with this little thing here and then you have HTML tag here HTML closing tag here and then you have a head and a body just like we saw on YouTube and reddits before and on top of that CH GPT already added a few information in this head and body tag but we're going to see that later okay now you want to learn what you can add inside of a web page as a developer the web page 101 and for that I don't want you to just learn I want you to uh build something a real web page that you could show to a friend that could be a portfolio that could be a lending page for your IDE it doesn't matter just think about something that you can show to a friend and now any web page you see on the entire internet is made of three things HTML CSS and JavaScript if we compare this with a house HTML is the foundation the structure of the house without HTML there is no house we have CSS which is used for styling to make your web page beautiful the colors Etc and we have JavaScript which is used for uh user interaction and adding some Dynamic parts to your page so first we have HTML which is the foundation of any web page it is made with tags and attributes so just like we saw before this is uh written in HTML you have here a tag is this little thing here that where you see HTML it is surrounded with brackets around it and you always have an opening tag and a closing tag and everything inside is like a children of this tag and attributes like this are properties that you give to those tags you will see HTML is very simple uh there are a few tags you want to learn like for instance links to be able to link between web pages headings for titles paragraph if you need to write a block of text images of course buttons and inputs in forms and containers if you need to wrap things around you don't need to learn all the tags just learn the very minimum you can start writing the first version of your ID of your web page using HTML tags only then you can jump into CSS CSS is basically a way to style your page to make it more beautiful to change the layout Etc there are a few things that are important like colors layouts heading phone size Etc you don't need to learn everything once again in the road map you'll see there are few CSS properties that you can learn that are important but learn just enough to make a beautiful web page and then finally there is Javascript so JavaScript could be like a kitchen a bedroom a toilet whatever it has interaction it adds features to your web page for instance when you click the like button under this video on YouTube it will Tri JavaScript to do something if you actually do like the video that means a lot for me JavaScript could be quite Advanced there are many things to learn I would recommend to start with those foundations the very minimum for instance you could have a button that when you click on it it sends a little Hello message somewhere on the page and use that homepage. HTML file we created earlier to add text to change the text color add features using JavaScript no matter what and whenever you're stuck with something whenever you need to learn something ask chpt to help you around once you're done and you've saved your file what you can do is is you can open this file and view the results of your creation for instance now if I open this like homepage. HTML if I double click I'm going to go in my internet browser and it's going to display the things that I wrote with my code and now you can do something even crazier you can send that web page to someone I'm just going to go drag and drop it to my wife on WhatsApp send the page to my wife and now if she opens her phone and double click on this file it will open her internet browser and she will be able to see the code that I wrote and just like this you have made your first web page now of course uh it is not available on the internet there is no way for anyone across the world to access my web page but you'll see that is very simple we're going to cover that in the next part okay now moving on to part two here you're going to learn exactly what you need in order to build any internet business here I said SAS short Force software but that can be a directory that can be a habit tracker that can be an AI tool it can be literally anything for instance these are all the websites that I built they're all very different you have like a analytics tools that I built habit tracker that are made for people to uh track their reading and workout habit um I have built directories like this one where you have like thousands of uh pages indexed on Google and I am using all the time the exact same road map that I will show you right here so we're going to cover how to create landing pages how to process payment how to create user account API database front end backend anything that you have heard of and that you think you need in order to build an internet business will be in this road map the first step is to pick a text tack so this is the text T I use for absolutely all of my apps in the programming language I am using JavaScript some developers use python or C or C++ usually for the back end but mine only use JavaScript language it's much easier I don't have to learn two languages just JavaScript on the front end part which is what people are going to see I'm using react which is a JavaScript library to build reusable components like buttons and and forms that my users can click on I am using twin CSS to make writing CSS a little bit easier I am using Daisy UI which is a free UI component Library so it has a set of like predefined buttons and tables so I don't have to design everything from scratch and I am using nextjs as a reactjs uh framework in order to organize pages on the back end which is the part that users don't see usually the server I am using two Services I'm using nextjs for the API we're going to cover that later but it's basically the invisible part where you do all your business logic and I am using mongodb for the database to store information and I'm using some thirdparty tools in order to help me in my process so for instance for user authentification uh login with Google Etc I am using OJs to send emails across the internet I am using recent I am using stripe and sometimes lemon squeezy to charge and process payments so subscription what time payments invoices Etc and I am using data fast as a web analytic tools to know for instance who visits my website okay maybe at this point you're wondering like what is going on to HTML JavaScript and CSS what are we doing all of this you'll see that even though the internet relies on web pages and everything you see on the internet is HTML JavaScript and CSS as a developer it is much faster to use those tools in order to write HTML JavaScript and CSS for us those tools are just meant to make our life easier the text tack I use right here is almost free for you to use you see most of those tools have free plans so you can get started with 0 and of course if you don't like my Tex tack if you have heard of another tools that you prefer to use it is perfectly fine what is important here is that whenever you have decided what you're going to use for your text tag you want to stick to it and never change it because every time you have to learn a new tool you're losing time on things that matters which is shipping apps and you will see that in the ends all those text tax thing it's always the same debate you can do pretty much anything you want with any text stack and finally I want to mention that I am not sponsored whatsoever in here to make this video uh none of those tools that you see here are paying me to make that the only sponsor of this video is myself I created this course called code fast uh to teach people how to learn to code quickly it's a 12 hours course on the same Principle as you see in this video it's more Hands-On because we're going to code along over 2,000 students have already learned how to code using the course but of course you don't need the course in order to learn how to code you can learn by yourself using an AI in the road map I am going to show you right now okay before we get started you want to discover what the terminal is if you go on your computer and you search for terminal it is going to open a little app that looks like this where you can type command line it's basically a chat box to do stuff on your computer so here for instance if I type PWD is going to tell me in which folder I am I can navigate inside of folders like CD and here I entered the desktop there are very few simple commments like those ones PWD CD LS Etc that you can learn to help you later you also have a terminal inside of your code editor now if you go to the top and you search for terminal you can pop up a new terminal directly inside of your code editor which going to be useful for later and the reason we need a terminal at some point is because we're going to have some tools developer tools running on our computer to make our life easier and those tool usually need to be run using common lines in the terminal okay now that we're good with the terminal things we're going to move on and set up your computer to use all the tools we have from the text tack so first of all you will need to install node.js you'll find nodejs as the first link on Google just click here and download it for your computer it was not really clear for me when I started to code why I need nodejs so here is a quick example of why you need it when you are on your uh computer your internet browser so Safari or Google Chrome there is something called the V8 engine which is the little background process that is running all the time and that is used to execute JavaScript if you want to test your V8 engine on your computer you can go to any website you can open the developer console and you can see that you can write JavaScript inside of the console here and if I write alert name is going to print uh send me a little alert with my name this thing here is able to run JavaScript thanks to the V8 engine that is coming already installed on your computer and it allows us developers to write JavaScript inside of HTML Pages now nodejs it's very similar to the uh engine except that it can run on any computer anywhere any time that means now that you could start a little engine on your computer not necessarily on internet browser but like in the background on your computer and you can run JavaScript from anywhere so we're going to use it for two things we're going to use it right now on your computer to set up all those developer tools and run them in the background and you're going to use it later automatically when we're going to push your site on the internet there will be some processes that are always running on the machine we're going to push your code so that it listens for like visitors coming to your site and is able to answer those requests okay the second thing we need is to install nextjs we're going to use nextjs for two things the front end what people see and the back end what people don't see some developers use two completely separate Frameworks for their front end and backend I just find it easier to use GS for both of them for the front end for like web pages thing that our visitors are going to see and use um you remember from the previous section of this video that we have HTML files that are able to be shown somewhere on your internet browser but you'll see that with nextjs we're not going to write HTML directly we're going to write JavaScript and then on your computer there will be a process that will turn these JavaScript into an HTML files that we are going to send back to visitors so that they can see your creation on their internet browser and this process that will turn the JavaScript into HTML is using behind the hood nodejs that we just downloaded and for the backend part with nextjs it is using serverless so we won't have to manage an entire instance or machine and put it on the internet uh this will be done automatically for us so we won't have to think about that but don't worry about that we're going to go deeper later and finally if you haven't done it from the previous lesson already you want to install a code editor like vs code or cursor okay now we need to install nextjs the framework that we're going to use to show pages to our customer so the front end part but also as the backend the server so the thing that is invisible to customer where we're going to have our API and database logic Etc some developers prefer to have two separate projects for their front end and their backend I just find it easier to use just nextjs for both the front end and the back end so to install nextjs just go on Google Search for nextjs and take the first link that you see you will see this little command line written right here just copy that and open your terminal just before you pass the command here and press enter make sure you are in the right folder because it's going to create a nextg project so for that I am going to navigate to my desktop on my computer and I'm going to go inside of the nodejs workspace this is exactly the same as if I were going to click here on the desktop and open this node.js workspace so now that I am inside of the node.js workspace I can pass the common and press enter so quick breakdown of the common here uh this npx thing now is available because we just downloaded nodejs so we have access to this command which is going to execute something the something we're going to execute is this common here create next app which is something that the nextjs team has created to uh create an entire project right on our computer and the AD Sign and latest right here just mean that we want to use the latest version of this program so we have access to the latest feature it's not a big deal but it's better you just copy paste it the way it's given here it's going to promt you with a bunch of questions so you press y to proceed I'm going to name my project unicorn uh I am not going to use typescript yes foran lint yes for kwin CSS we don't need the SRC directory yes we need the app router yes we need turbo pack and we don't need to customize the import alas once you press enter here it is going to set up something on your computer and you will see that on the left side in this folder there will be a new folder that is created uh that I named unicorn that in this unicorn folder will contain all the nextjs file the project was successfully created and now if I visually go to my uh unicorn folder you will see that I can uh actually see all the new files that were added so all of those files here uh were created during the command line script that we executed just before and finally if you haven't already from the previous lesson you want to download a code editor like vs code or cursor okay now open your code editor and open the folder we just created so for me it's in my desktop no JS workspace and then unicorn now you see on the left side I have all the files and folder that were created automatically for me there's a bunch of stuff going on here and this is going to be your workspace basically as a developer so we need to understand and break down a little bit of what is going on so there are multiple things here that are going on inside of this project the first one and a very important one is the package manager we now have access to npm npm stands for node package manager it's basically a directory of modules of packages that we can use from the internet so for instance uh there are developers who create really cool libraries like a date peer a nice form or this like a component library that we're going to use later in the project with there's a bunch of components that were already made and are available for free and you can just download it uh here for instance the commment to download this entire package with all those components is npm I short for install Daisy UI and if you run this common inside of your terminal you will have access to all those components inside of your own project actually if we go back to the project and you open the nodecore modules folder you will see you already have a bunch of packages that were installed already for you you can actually see a list of all the packages that we have installed now they are here inside of your package the Jon is like a a controller of all the list of packages that we have installed they are here in the dependencies or the dev dependencies here we have react react D and next and sometimes those packages realiz on other packages which r on other packages that's why we have like an array of packages so here we only have a few packages but you have a thousands maybe 100 packages here in the ne modules is because some of those ones here rely on more packages and whenever you installed a new package it's going to appear somewhere here in this package.json file so now I'm going to open a terminal inside of the code editor so I am already inside of my project and if I want to install a new package I just have to type npm installed and the name of the package and another part that is important in your package manager is that you can run script using the npm Run script name comment so let's go back to the project here here we see in the package J Json you have already four scripts and the first one the dev script is one that we're going to use a lot to run a script npm run and the name of the script now when I press enter it's going to execute this command this is something that was created by the nextjs team and it's going to set up my computer to uh run a little development server so that I can write and compile code here it tells me to go to uh Local Host 30001 is because I already have another script run running but for you it's likely local h 3000 just copy or follow this link go to your internet browser and press enter and you should see right here a little uh website that is now on your computer so as a quick recap about the node package manager uh now on your project you have access to a few commands you can install or update packages which are like uh tools uh that were created by other developers that will help you in your uh programming journey and you can run scripts which are going to do a stuff on your computer which going to execute something on your computer like the one we just run npm runev where we are setting a local development server to make your website the next part that's important for your project is the Version Control System I might get canceled by real software engineer for putting GitHub and git inside of the same uh topic here uh but roughly those two Services git and GitHub will help you do a bunch of things on one hand you have git which is going to help you make versions of your code so for instance you push a new feature or you fix a bugs you create a new version for your code and so that later if you realize you made a mistake you can revert back to the previous version it helps you organize your code and GitHub is like a Google Drive for developers where you're going to push your code uh what you write on your computer you're going to push it on the internet in GitHub it's a free service and we're going to push all of our code out there so in case you lose your computer you can still download your code from GitHub later on you'll see that we'll have something connected to GitHub and then whenever GitHub as a new change a new code that is being pushed is going to deploy our change to our actual website okay first let's start with Git and just a few thing here those three commments GI had git commit and git push um you don't need to memorize them but basically they're inside of your code editor there uh whenever for instance I press the plus Button as stage the change it is the same thing as if I type git add dots inside of my terminal right here those three commands are the ones you're going to use the most but technically you won't have to write them because well your code editor has a interface for you to just type buttons so you don't have to write those comments and finally there is the dogit ignore file uh which is already installed in your project uh right here on the root side if you open it you'll see a bunch of uh words and things here um each line is basically one thing to ignore so we don't want git to track those files or folders uh for instance the slash node modules which is this one right here this like a massive folder of modules that we've talked about earlier we don't want git to track this because those are dependencies this is not code that we write as developers those are just packages we installed so we don't need to track this inside of git normally you won't have to touch the git ignore file but just in case you know that anything that is in here will be ignored by git and therefore won't be put pushed to GitHub to install git on your computer go to those three dots on the left and click download git for your Mac follow the link they tell you and here if you are a Windows user you're lucky it's very simple if you're a micos user we need to install a home brew first so click The Homebrew uh link and then install Homebrew copy pass. command line and open your terminal just pass that command into your terminal and press enter it's going to go on the internet and inst the soft it's not a software it's that the it's similar to npm the package manager we had we talked about previously for nodejs except that is for your entire Mac OS system to complete the home brew installation we just need to copy past the lines of code they tell us so uh copy the first one past it interior terminal press enter and do the exact same thing for the second one now that you're done you can go back to the git inst ation page and copy past the command Homebrew install git and P it into your terminal press enter is going to install git and then a few second later you should be done you'll need to restart vs code so go to vs code close the application and then restart the application again open the repository we were working on and then go back to the three dots thing and click initiate repository and here you're going to see the list of all the files that were changed in this project and we're going to go over that very soon whenever you're done coding a little feature for your application or maybe like fix a bug you want to create a new version using git for that you're going to use git commit quite often to make a commit you will have to go on the git part of vs code so the little three dots at the top left and then you would have to write a message usually you would write something that is explicit uh for instance added this feature or fix that buug in this case we're just getting started so we're going to write first commit and the message is only for you later to remember press commit and you're going to see a little error message is because we need to set up git for your computer for the first time and if you scroll in the error message you will see that there are two missing uh things we have to run get config Global you need to set up your email and your username this is not going to log you anywhere it's not on the Internet it's just purely staying on your computer just so you just so git knows who is the user who made those changes so you don't even have to write your actual email you can write anything you want copy paste those lines of code um go to your terminal pass the comment there eventually update the email or the name if you want press enter and then click commit again and boom here we go you've made your first commit now you've created the first version of your app it would be great if your code was stored somewhere on the internet so that if you lose your computer or if you work with other developers they can access it or you can access it from another computer and for that we're going to have to use GitHub so when you click publish branch is going to ask you to sign up for GitHub you'll have to create an account this time with a real email so sign up with whatever you have uh as your primary email finish the GitHub tutorial like sign up entirely and then go back to this course all right so now you're signed up to GitHub it's basically some kind of like Google Drive for developers the code you write on your computer can be pushed on GitHub so it's online and either other developers can use it or you can use it with other computers so now go back to vs code and you can click publish Branch uh it's going to ask you again to sign up with GitHub this side you have an account so you can just authorize vs code to access your GitHub account and is going to reopen vs code for you and here uh select the publish to GitHub private repository and after a few seconds your project will be pushed on GitHub now if you go to your GitHub profile you can see the repository your project with the entire code that we've been writing on your computer okay another tool that is going to make your life much easier as a developer is called the linter the linter we use in our project is called es lint if you open your project if you go to whatever file you want and let's remove for instance uh this little line here you can see that I have a red color and it says GSX element has no corresponding closing tag is because in the background I have this linter called es lint that is analyzing my code all the time and whenever I make some typo or whatever I write code that should not exist it's going to try to tell me uh where the error is and how to fix it and now they even connected with AI so I can actually just click here and ask the AI to fix it in the composer for me if you ever need to customize some of the rules and how it behaves uh you would search for ES lint somewhere in your project and you could customize some of the behavior of the linter okay and finally let's have a quick look at the nextjs project architecture so you see now we have a big folder with a bunch of of files and a bunch of folders inside of the app folder is where you're going to write most of your code you're going to create new pages you're going to create components Etc inside of the public folder is where we're going to put some like files and icons uh things that we want to be available anywhere on the internet and then you have a bunch of other files uh we have the package Jen that is kind of like the controller of our app we have a configuration file for nextjs you have your GE ignore file you have your uh lint uh file as well uh those are more like controller files now you might be wondering like well Mark um previously we used HTML to make a simple web page that I can send to my friend and they can see it and now we have all those things with like different uh type names and extensions and folders Etc where is my HTML file so this is what we have done before we created an HTML page we send it to a friend it opens their internet browser and they can see what you have created and anywhere you go on the internet no matter what website you visit you're going to receive HTML JavaScript and and CSS but the problem is as a developer if you were to create an entire website using just pure HTML JavaScript and CSS it would be kind of tedious and kind of boring to be honest that's why developers have created uh Frameworks and libraries around it to write in a different language that is faster and easier to write and instead is going to turn what we have created what we have coded into actual HTML JavaScript and CSS so this is exactly why we have a nextjs project instead of writing HTML we're going to write JavaScript the JS stands for JavaScript meaning the file will be written using JavaScript language we're going to use libraries like react to write even faster and nextjs is going to compile our uh code into valid actual HTML JavaScript and CSS so there are three main components here the programming language we're using is Javascript on top of it we have reactjs as a JavaScript library is going to give us a set of tools to do things faster so for instance we can create usable components so for instance we can create a button that shows a little message using react and we can reuse that exact same component at many different areas into our app so this is going to make our life much easier and finally on top of this we have nextjs which is a react JS framework which is going to help us organize all our code and also going to compile all the code we write and turn it into actual HTML JavaScript and CSS so that anyone in the world with an internet browser can uh see and use our app all right one one last thing about breaking down the actual project uh you know there are bunch of files here you're not really yet sure of how those files interact with each other but don't worry the goal here with this video is to show you really the minimum you need to know in order to turn uh your idea into an actual project so we're going to jump into the coding as fast as possible and only later when you will need to customize a few things you will learn by yourself um what each of those files are needed for and since now ai is here to help us developers build but also explain stuff I recommend you to start setting up your AI co-pilots in your code editor so for cursor the one I use myself it is already here if I press command L uh it's going to open a chat window with an AI I think if you're using vs code you will have to add a little extension like here you would have to search for GitHub copilot um it really depends on your code editor just search it on Google you'll easily find it one of the first use case of AI which you can use even before starting a how a code is to explain what you don't understand directly in ins of your code base so for instance here um I just set up this project I am new uh to nextjs I don't understand every uh single of those Styles but I can do is I can just type English and I can ask my AI what is the app folder this thing here used for and then you'll see that the AI is actually really good at explaining things for me so I have a clear understanding can also refine my prompt and explain me using metaphors I can ask it to explain it in my own language in French if I want you can really use this AI chats to explain you what every single part of the code is for okay theory is kind of boring so now it's time to jump into the part where we're going to actually code something we're going to build a landing page a landing page is basically a single static page where you can uh introduce your idea or you can showcase your skill like your portfolio page what I want you to do here is to actually build something for yourself even if it's a very simple website just build something along with me because later we're going to deploy it on the internet and you'll be able to send uh your website to anyone and they will be able to access and visualize and see what you have created there are three parts when it comes to creating landing pages there is react nextjs and tedwin CSS okay first we need to start a development server so pop up your terminal common shift n as a shortcut and write npm run Dev press enter and it is going to start a local development server now to view the project I can just go to uh HTTP Local Host 3000 I'm going to copy that link and I am going to my uh internet browser pass the link here press enter and then I can see my actual app and so now whenever you make changes inside of the code this little script here is going to rerun this page and you're going to see the latest changes so for instance if I were to add a yo right here you can see that now my Local Host 3000 website is showing what I just wrote okay the first and probably the most important part is react it's the most popular JavaScript library used to build user interface it's basically like uh you're going to create component that you can use reuse across your app react developer are usually paid really well and there a bunch of courses that you can find on the internet if you want to go deeper uh but you will see that most of them are actually really long like 70 80 uh sometimes 100 of hours I believe that you need way less if you want to turn your idea into a tiny product for the internet so here are some of the core concept I think you should know in order to uh build something on the Internet there are two categories those on the left here are a reacton uh concept and on the right there are some advanc JavaScript concept that you will probably uh need in order to build your react components uh now it would take a couple of hours if I had to go through each of those concept which might be a little bit too much for this YouTube video um if you really want to go deeper with me and code along I have created the course name code fast where you have all those fundamentals concept and we uh go over each of them and now in this future video I'm going to give you a quick overview of all of those Concepts first one is that everything in react is a component if we go to uh one of my website this one here and if we break it down into react component this is what you would see at the top you would have a header component then you would have this like a big hero component and then you would have the smaller one this button checkout component that allows me as a developer to uh write once and then I can put this button for instance at multiple places without having to uh rewrite it every single time so I just wrote it once and then it's here displayed at multiple locations now let's go to your code editor uh I am going to remove actually a bunch of things we don't need here that and that I'm going to save this and on the right this is what you would normally see in your local Whole 3000 since we're going to write bunch of components a common practice is to create a new folder code components inside of this folder you're going to create one file per react component in this case here the demo I want to show you is a counter component so I'm going to name it counter with a Capital C and then JS for JavaScript it's important that you name your uh component as well as the file name in a way that is easy for you as a human to understand as well as easy for an AI so that later on the AI can go through your codebase and understand it easier and this is a react component it's very simple it's just a simple JavaScript function so function counter here is the name of your component and it has to return something that something here looks like HTML it is not actual HTML it is jsx this is the notion here jsx it's a syntax language uh that we're going to use to uh basically return every uh thing that we want to show to our users in this case I am just returning this div which is very simple now I need to show this component to the user and since one component is inside of a file we need to export the component so we make it available to other files so then for instance in this page.js we can import the component from that file and we can display it right here when now when I press save you can see that I have the sort of counter being shown here and since it's a reusable component then I can show it even three times if I want and I will have it three time right here and so this component now is reusable I can use it across anywhere I want in my app now there's another important notion in react called props props are like properties that we are going to give to components so they can be customizable in the function to create a react components there will be a parameters pass name props this is an object where we can pass specific properties so the components can behave differently so in this props we're going to show the title now if I go back to my page JS what I can do is I can add title and I can give it the value of counter 1 counter two counter three and now when I press save you'll see that I see counter 1 counter two counter three and so thanks to this prop uh thing then for the same component I can have different output different look different customization now with just those few things here you can already create a nice lending page just a visual lending page to present your idea you might want to have some kind of user interaction like what happens if someone clicks on a button and for that we need to introduce the notion of server and client components so there are two types of react components by default all react component we create are server components and the difference between a server and a client component is basically when is this component rendered so in the case of a server component if a client someone a visitor from the internet goes to your website the server is going to uh take the reactjs component is going to compile this reactjs component which means it's going to turn this JavaScript code into HTML and then it's going to send back to the client this HTML uh component in our case the counter. JS react component is a server component because it's the default value so whenever we navigate to localle 3000 our the little script running in our computer is turning this uh JavaScript code into an HTML code and sending back to the client so that me as a person I actually see HTML here in uh my internet browser now in some cases where you want to have user interaction like people click on buttons and you update the component you want to use react client components in this case when the clients goes to your server and ask for uh whatever page react is going to check the the client components and he's going to send them back as they are and then when the JavaScript code Returns on the client then react is going to swap this reactjs this JavaScript code into an actual HTML the rendering process is going to be done on the client side hence it makes it a react client component to make a react client component all you have to do at the top of the file you just have to write quotequote use client and now since my counter is a client component that gives me access to more react features for instance I have access to react hooks like uh use State and use effects which are very handy function that's going to help us perform some actions we're going to cover that in a minute and we also have access to the unclick listener where we can listen for uh events for like when people press on buttons on our app so now we have a client component we can listen for clicks uh let's actually turn these components into some like an actual counter okay so here I have updated the code uh don't mind about those class name thing those are just used to style a little bit the counter we're going to cover that in the Tailwind CSS section what we have here first we have imported the function named use state from the react Library this is the most popular react hooked which is used to uh save a state the actual state of a component in our case we want to save the actual counter how many times the button has been clicked on we're going to write this line where we call the function use state zero is the default value by default the value of the counter will be zero and then we have uh here a stateful variable named count and a set count which is a function that we can use to update the stateful variable and right here I am just displaying the value of counts and you can see for the three counters we see zero one of the big perks of using those like stateful variable is that whenever we update the count using set count react will rerender under our page it will show the new value of count without us developers having to do anything all we have to do is to just call the method set counts so here I have created two buttons a minus button and a plus button one will decrement the value of count and one will increment it on each of those button we have this event listener on click so that whenever a person clicks on the button then it's going to trigger a function and this function is this thing here this will be called whenever someone clicks on the plus button or the minus button and what this function is doing here it's calling the set count function this one that is going to update the count and we're going to reuse the previous value of the counter so the actual value right before the click and we're going to say that the new value is the count value minus one and exactly the same for the increment counter where we're going to say plus one and so now you'll see that when I press the plus button the value of count is updated and since it's a stateful variable in the background react rerenders the component and shows the actual new value so those are some of the core and fundamental concept of react and you will see that you can go already pretty far just with some of those okay now the next concept is nextjs it's a react framework it's mostly going to be used to organize your pages so we're going to write react components and we're going to put all of them inside of one page and nextjs in the background is going to turn this reactjs code and compile it so we can give it to people on the internet as HTML these are the fundamentals of nextjs I think you should learn um of course there are a bunch of other features that they have but those ones here will get you pretty far so for instance a page.js it's a file convention whenever you write inside of your code page.js nextjs is going to create a new page for you so this right here this entire thing is a page um actually if I look at the content inside of page JS you can see that I am exporting a function with a capital letter that is returning some jsx and what you can notice here is that a page is actually a real reactjs component it's just a big react component that is going to have other components inside to be shown on the client so nextjs is going to help you organize your pages now let's say we want to have another page at SL dashboard like a private dashboard for your customers for instance what you can do is you can create a new folder named uh dashboard the name of the the actual path you want inside of the app folder and inside of this folder you create a new page.js this is a convention it has to be named page.js and here you can uh create a new reactjs component so a function that exports some jsx and now when I go here and I press enter I am going to go in inside of this like new uh page for now it's it's a boring page it doesn't do much thing but uh this is how you are going to use nextjs to create a bunch of pages for your app another feature of nextjs is the layout. JS so here once again we already have one created this is a Convention as well you have to name it layout. JS and it's basically going to be a wrapper around your pages and all the things you do here will be applied to the underneath pages so again here we have a react component because everything is a react component and what it says here is that basically we're going to wrap all the pages so children is a keyword in uh react that you also should learn um and then we're going to wrap all those pages inside of an HTML and a body tag actually we do that here because we applied this G sense variable so this is basically like a font the font we actually get from from Google and we want to apply the same font on every pages and we can do that simply using layout. JS if I want to go crazy and set a background color of red inside of the layout you can see that in my SL dashboard page the background is not red and the background of my main page is also red so whenever you apply something inside of a layout. JS every uh thing here will be applied to all the pages underneath there are two other things that nextjs has created for us that is very handy uh those are two react components so we have link and image you would use the link one in order to navigate from pages to Pages you would first import the link component from the next package and then you would simply do link so you would have the hre attribute and you would point to wherever you want to point so in this case I want to go to the dashboard and then you can write text or anything else inside and then you should have a nice link on your page and if you click I'm going directly to the dashboard so now you might be wondering why we just don't use the HTML a tag and the reason behind is when we use this component nextjs in the background will do some work and is going to prefetch the dashboard page so that whenever we click on this link it is super fast to navigate to the dashboard page so whenever you have some navigation going on inside of your app you mostly want to use the link component again finally the image component here will help you display images in the right format so I have added this little nextjs PNG file inside of my app folder then in my dashboard component I'm going to import this image and I'm also going to import the image component from the next package and I can just use it like this you have a source attribute where in this case I'm passing the image here the image is available inside of the project that's why I'm I'm using this uh thing but you can also pass a URL of an image here instead then a few parameters and then a few uh styling options and then here I can see my image is displayed you could technically use the HTML image tag uh the reason we do it using nextjs is that there are going to optimize our image so my image right here is actually pretty big I think the file is around 1 mbte so what next is doing using this components instead of the traditional image HTML tag they optimize the image now if I go to my console and I check the image itself uh you see that I have multiple uh Source set in the background nexs is basically trying to uh guess how big the size of my screen is and is going to serve the the smallest possible image size so if you can see here uh the file size is only 10 kilobytes which is like I think 10x or maybe even 100x smaller than my original file so it's a common practice to use the image tag to help you um load images faster for your users and better for SEO as well okay now the missing part of the puzzle is how to style our react component and for that we're going to use tawin CSS which is a framework around CSS you can find it in your package.json normally you already have tawin CSS installed with nextjs tawin CSS is a CSS framework which is going to make our our life much easier if you were to write an entire app using only CSS you would go you would do lots of back and forth between your components and the style you apply to them and trust me it would get very boring instead TN has created a bunch of classes that we can apply right away inside of our components for instance here in the title of my counter I already have the text Excel class that was created by twin CSS their class have a good naming so it's easier for us developers to know what they're doing so you would kind of get that if I apply text Excel the text will be of like a large font now if I go crazy if I appli text for Excel you would see that the counter becomes really big and just for fun I'm going to say text EXs and you see that now the counter uh title is very small and actually if I hover my mouse on the the the actual class I can see the CSS uh class that is created for us so this text Excel applies the CSS property phone size of 20 pixels and a line height of 28 pixels if you don't have this inside of your code editor just go for your extension Tab and search for the tawin CSS intelligence plugin and then you will start showing you the CSS property that are applied and you will see twin has a bunch of classes I think they have over a thousand classes uh for instance this one uh P6 P stands for padding and it applies 24 pixels of padding inside of the counter if instead I would write px6 and py12 I would apply 24 pixels of uh hor horizontal pading so X stands it's for the horizontal axis and the y stands for the vertical axis and you can see here on my card I have on the left side and on the right side we have 24 pixels and we have 48 pixels at the bottom and at the top the name of the colors as well are much easier to apply so for instance you kind of guess that the Border applied here will be gray which is much easier than if you had to write the hex color into CSS itself there are a bunch of classes and you don't need to learn all of them but I recommend you is to take all the CSS classes you need so maybe like a font size font weight the padding margin Etc and learn only the Tailwind CSS classes you need to style your page one you're going to need quite often is the flex container uh which allows me here to create three containers uh on top of each other uh so I created this little like a cheat cheet if that helps you can uh take a screenshot of it it is going to help you organize your uh Flex container and the flex items inside and have like a layouts where you have stuff on the top left stuff on the top right Etc I think I forgot to mention that we writing react component we are not using the class attribute we're using class name but of course remember next GS is going to compile our project and send HTML JavaScript and CSS to the client so now if I go into my internet browser I inspect the counter um I don't have class name written I have the attribute class written here and if I click on it I can see all the CSS classes that tawin has created for us and of course life wouldn't be fun as a developer if we didn't have access to UI components libraries so the one I use to create buttons form cards Etc on all my app is Daisy UI it is a collection of pre-made component that I can use inside of my app without having to style them so this is the daisy UI website and uh for instance if you go to their documentation you can have access to all those buttons so they have different states so if you press on them they move different colors um they react to when you hover them with your mouse cursor uh you have avatars you have uh badges Etc uh you want to you to leverage UI uh component libraries as much as you can so you don't have to do everything from scratch now in our project what we can do is we can install it so we can do npmi daisy UI this is going to install Daisy UI inside of my project I'm going to restart the de development server and now we should be able to access all of their classes oh actually I just forget one thing I have to open the Tailwind configuration file and then here I have to include the daisy UI plugin in order for tawin to know that we are using this UI Library so now for instance we can use Daisy UI buttons for our counter um I think this round button would look great so I have to look for the jsx and they told me to add BN BN Circle so I just add it right here inside of the button and now I can see that I have like two clicky buttons on the left side and on the right side of the counter which make my app much more stylish and easy to use now is time we are going to deploy your website on the internet so that anyone in the world can see it and I'm going to get a domain name so people have an easy access to go to your website and for that I'm going to give you a free preview of my course cut fast where we're going to go over those lessons and I'm going to guide you step by step in how to deploy your website on the internet first make sure you commit all your changes and push them to GitHub you might have something different than me here it doesn't matter just commit your changes then go to versal decom versal is a company that will provide a server for you so that you can put your code and you can serve to anyone anywhere on the internet and also versal has a free plan that lets us deploy our projects at no cost I personally use versal for all my project I have no affiliation with them whatsoever it's just very simple to deploy a project if you do not fcy Verso uh there are some Alternatives like netlify or render once you're on this page uh click Start deploying and login with GitHub you will enter your github's credential and you will be prompted to connect your versal account with your GitHub account authorize the connection and I will see you on the other side okay now you should land on a page that it's a little bit similar you're going to go uh here add a new project and we are going to look for the repository you created on GitHub this is mine right here I have many other for other my project at this moment you might have only one click import versal might ask you to reauthorize something just make sure you let versal connect with GitHub and then do not change anything right here and just click deploy it's going to take a couple of minutes you have something called build logs this is the place where versal is going to take all your code and is going to run it on their servers as a little hint you can see that it's running in Washington DC at least for me um this is where your server is and then you can follow along with the time and the commments that are being executed um it looks like everything is going fine is generating some pages for our application and within a few seconds maybe a few minutes it should be done here we go the project was deployed I'm going to continue to the dashboard and I am going to get this button where I can visit my project and this is it the project is available on the internet I have a URL that I can share to any friends and anyone on the planet can see my project and just a quick break down here of what we have um this is versal doapp the domain name that versal owns and they give you a subdomain on their domain so that anyone can access your website later we will connect our own domain so we don't need to use the versal one and if you're running into any kind of issue during the building process you can go to the build logs and then here you will see probably some red color it will give you a hint of what is going on what broke down in the deployment phase if you have a code that is a little bit different than mine you might run into an error or two and it's perfectly fine normally they will tell you where the error come from and how to fix it um just copy past this error in Google or CH GPT to help help you let's break down a little bit about the process what is actually going on so you are working on your computer and you make changes on your code and when you press the commit and sync button is going to run those common git commit git push which is going to send the new code to GitHub now that we've connected versal and GitHub then whenever there is a change on GitHub versal will be updated so versal is going to run two command npn run build is going to check the new code and create a bundle of all the pages an npn Run start is going to start a little development server on uh versal and it's going to start listening for requests for people and serve the new pages updated with a new code let's dive just a little bit deeper into the two those two comments so on your local machine in the package.json you have those three scripts the one we always run is npn run Dev and the one that will run on versal by default is npn run build and npn run starts the npn Run build you can actually run it on your computer if you want just stop the development server and say npn run build you can just follow along with this tutorial as well you don't have to do it the npn Run build script is creating an optimized bundle of your application and once it's done running it's going to put all the code in the do next folder it's a very complicated folder with stuff will'll never touch but it's the code is there and it's optimized to be sent to visitors and the npn Run start command server so it's listening for HTTP request and it's going going to use the next folder to give the right HTML pages so somehow those two uh build and start script are a little bit similar to what the dev script is doing the dev one is used on our local machine because it has some extra features like if you save a file for instance is going to refresh the entire page so that you can see your changes right away but for production it's good we create an app that's as small as possible that's why versal is going to run those two scripts you are now entering the most exciting part of the course we're going to buy a domain name and usually developers will buy a domain as soon as they have an ID and they usually never push code to it so congratulation you already have a tiny application and we're going to connect this with your future domain name also note that you don't have to buy a domain name right now although I really recommend you to do so because it's it's a very important part of the entire Journey you'll need a domain name um for the business side of things you'll need a domain name to rank your uh pages on Google you need a domain name to send links in the course I'll always do my best to make sure that there is an Alternatives where you don't need a domain but it's a very good thing if you do so right now to buy a domain name I usually use name chip uh for no specific reason I have no affiliation with them I just like them there is godadi that is also very popular since I named my app cfast sast I will search for cfast sas.com hopefully it's available I think it is it is available and it's pretty shipped which is nice um if you're is not available you can go with any other uh extension called TLD top level domain uh the here is one of the most popular but you have many others like.org net doio uh there are a bunch of them and it really doesn't matter which one you use I own a St domain like k.st and this doesn't make any difference if you already have a business name in mind go ahead and purchase a domain that is related to that if you have no clue what you're going to build in the future what you can do now is you can purchase something that is related to your name so that you can build a little portfolio website later for instance I own mar.com and this is my portfolio of little projects then proceed to check out uh create your account and I'll see you on the other side okay now I assume that you have voted your domain name so congratulation one of the thing you want to do first is to enable the auto renew feature because you actually do not own the domain name forever you are actually renting it for a year and this will ensure that your credit card will be charged every year so your domain name doesn't go away uh because in that case you can actually lose it if someone purchase it and if you are using another domain register than name chip for instance godadi the auto renew feature will be there for sure is just going to be at a different uh location on the user interface and then the part we're interested in is called Advance DNS if you're using another register it might be named a little bit different like manage gns or Zone file you are looking for user interface where you see these kind of things where you have type host value we're going to use these settings here to connect people who are visiting our domain name with our applications hosted on versal so now going to versal I'm going to go to the settings part in my project and on the left side there should be a domains um Tab and here you want to add your domain name and then press the button add and you can go with one or the the first or the second option I usually choose the second one it's just a matter of preference whether you want people uh to visit ww.you name.com or yourdomain name.com and then when you press add versal is going to give you the instructions to connect your domain name and the project so here they're telling me I should add a record in my DNS of type c name with uh the name ww and the value should be this so copy that value here and go back to your DNS settings and add a new record the new record was a C name record we're going to go over that in a minute the host or the name is www and the value is the one you just created then press save change and we're going to do the exact same thing for uh the second one the root domain the domain name.com where this time we need to add an A type record with the name of uh at and the value should be this IP address so going back to name chip and I'm going to add this new record of type A the host should be be at and the IP address should be this then save the changes and let's go back to versal and normally within a few minutes after a refreshing they will uh connect successfully the domain to your viral project it could take up to 24 hours for those things to connect so if it doesn't work within the first 5 minutes it's totally fine um if it still doesn't work after 24 hours you want to go back here and check that you put the exact same uh thing here to make sure that everything is correct um now that it is working I can see that if I go to Cod fast sas.com then I end up on my virtual project and then I can send this link to anyone my friends my family um and they will be able to see the exact same thing as me uh let's go here just to understand really quickly what's happening when someone visits your domain name.com it's going to go first to the DNS the DNS um is name cheap or is GoDaddy it's basically a big server um that you can compare with a phone book if you're an old person like me where they map domain names to IP addresses people in general will never remember IP addresses it will be way too complex so they remember something simple like a domain name and then the DNS will do the work of mapping the domain to an IP address and this IP address is an address of a computer on the internet and it's magically the versal computer where we host our project versal is going to receive the request and return the right page to the client I went a little fast when purchasing the domain names so let's break it down let's say for this example that I own domain.com when I own domain.com I also own any subdomain under underneath so I own ww. doom.com email. doom.com anything I want to create. doom.com subdomains are pretty useful when you want to separate some things let's say you want to have a subdomain that is responsible to send emails a subdomain like blog.com that serves a different application that is dedicated for your blog uh you'll see that it could be quite handy and when you purchase a domain you can edit the DNS records which are used to map domain name request to a specific type of data there are many types of domain name records we're going to study the most common ones a records which stands for address are used to map a domain uh request to an IP address the at sign here is used to describe the root of your domain so domain.com but you could also have like a subdomain here where you could write ww or email or blog and then map it to uh whatever IP address of your server where the code is running address records are the most common ones because it's uh super simple this someone goes to your domain name and you redirect them to your server cames record which stands for canonical names are used to create alas or subdomains here you would add the subdomain so ww blog email uh whatever you want and then you would map it to another domain name this is quite useful if you want to redirect someone from your subdomain to your root domain for instance MX records MX stands for Mail Exchange are records to tell what to do when we receive an email at let's say mark.com and the value here should be the domain name of a mail server it's usually a company that knows what to do with incoming emails and could either save them forward them reply to them it's usually a paid service and finally we have the txt records txt stands for text and those are used only for display purposes so all those records are public meaning anyone can see them and we typically use txt records to show that we own a domain to verify a domain for instance if you want to submit your website to Google so that they know your exist they will probably ask you to add a txt record with some kind of like a unique identifier just to show that you own the domain and you were able to update the value here all right at this point you already have a bunch of information and knowledge in order to deploy a website show it your friends you can present your ideas you can do already a bunch of things what I really recommend you to do is to build a little portfolio or build like a demo page for your ID and put it on the internet now we have built mostly static websites where um people can view stuff but they cannot do much apart from just seeing your website this is where we have to introduce another big notion in programming called The backend the backend in other word is like all the things that your users don't see they can be like saving information into a database that can be creating a user account they can be uh calling another API like open AI to summarize a piece of text it includes really a bunch of stuff that are invisible for users and of course we want our front end and our backend to communicate and for that we going to have to create API endpoints an API endpoint is basically like a little door on your server so that your front end can communicate with your back ends so there are two parts the first one is actually create an API endpoint on the server side so these are some of the core concept we're going to go over and there is the front end part the thing that will our users our visitors will be able to play with like touch buttons Etc and these are some of the core JavaScript Concepts that we need for our front end to communicate with our backend now to understand a little bit about API endpoints and create your first API endpoint I'm going to give you again access to a free preview of my course to guide you step by step and right after that we're going to go back to our counter project and uh we are going to see how we can call like apis like uh open AI chpg apis for instance API here API there all developers are talking about API so what is it and why do we need API anyway the most common way to Transit data on the Internet is when someone is visiting a website the server is returning an HTML page the visitor is happy but an HTML page is not the only way that data travels on the internet in fact if you go to uh the cat ai.com jd. jpeg you will get back an image of a cat this is not an HTML page and if you go to this YouTube video of a guy wearing the same shirt as me and by pressing the like button we are making a request on the internet that is sent to the YouTube API now that you are a developer you'll see that uh internet is not just getting web pages you can also update data set data get images there are many other things we can do on the internet and this is where the terms API come from an API is basically a generic word to describe that a server has opened some doors for developers to per performs some kind of actions when you build software and web application a common use case is to have an API on the server so that our front end the HTML Pages can communicate with the back end we're going to create an API so that people can sign up for the service log to their account or even create a feedback board for instance and each of these individual functionalities that we're going to create are called API endpoints you can imagine an API endpoint as a door to the brain of your application but apis are not limited to only connection between web pages and servers they can be also server and servers without realizing it you've already called an API earlier when we created the database and you use the mongodb package in our application we are we were talking with the mongodb atlas API on their servers they have created an API endpoint that says give me your connection string give me a request and I'll perform the this action for you so that two servers can communicate to each other with apis theory is good but practice is much funnier so let's code our first API endpoint in the old days developers would have to create a dedicate seat server for their API but luckily with modern Technologies we can create an API right here inside of our nextjs project the first thing we want to do is we want to add a folder called API into the app folder that way we make sure we separate all the rest of the code the pages and and the images and the components from the API and inside of this API folder we're going to create another folder called oath oath is a short word for authentification and it would kind of make sense for us as we're doing user logging logout for now and to create your first API route nextjs made a convention whatever file that is named route. JS will become an API endpoint and we're going to write export function gate the export keyword it just mean that we can use this function outside of our project the function keyword is here because it's a simple JavaScript function and the get should be capitalized and it means that when anyone makes an HTTP get request to our API endpoint we're going to execute the code that's inside if you remember from the previous lessons there are four major types of HTTP request there is the get one where usually you request information there is the post one where you are uh adding some information to a database for instance there is a patch one when you want to edit and there is the delete one to yes you get it and then we are going to return this thing here so let's break it down first the response is a global object that's available our project is using JavaScript and there are some objects that are um available to us developers the response one is one of them and it's basically the response that you send when you get an HTTP request because remember uh to Transit data on the internet we make HTTP request with a method the get method for instance so we receive a request and we we answer with a response and the response is is here to help us format the data so that it can Transit on the internet if you hover it you will see that there are a few methods on it um if you don't like the what the person sent you you can reply with an error like your email is incorrect you can send some data in Json format you can also redirect the person to a different URL there are a bunch of methods and in this case I'm just using the Jon method so I'm going to send back some data and the data is this JavaScript object that is going to be formatted in Json format maybe we can give it a try so let's go to our internet browser maybe we open the developer console so we understand what is going on here go to the network tab to see that the how the data will be transiting and type localle 3000 and then uh since we're putting everything inside of the API folder you have to write slash API slash the other folder we created for user authentification so SLO and when you press enter you'll see that there are a few things happening first I'm not getting an HTML page back I'm getting some data and now if you look at what is going on here we see that we have made a request and when we click on it you'll see some interesting information so we've made a request the URL is the one we just type in the internet browser the method is get because as a person whenever you type something in your internet browser it will make a get request all the other method post patch delete are for developers since you're going to spend most of your time creating API endpoints and making communication between front end and back end let's study those concept a little deeper and let's also see how we can call another API like chpg and let's take for that an example let's say that every time as a person I press one of those buttons I want to send this information and save it into a database for that I will need to have an API endpoint that is uh receiving some information whether or not the user press the button Plus or the button minus and save this information in the database of course we would need first an API endpoint this is what it looks like I have created another uh route. JS file inside of/ API SLC counter uh here we're using a puff function because we're going to send some information along with the API request we're going to say the user press the plus button or the minus button and we need to know this information specifically and then we're going to use a try catch block this is very important this is very common in JavaScript because sometimes things will go wrong we programmer make mistakes and we want to have some way to gracefully handle those errors we don't want our function to crash for instance if I write some code that is not JavaScript when I try to execute this function is going to crash and in the front end part uh when people click buttons we don't want to uh show them the logs and these weird errors we want to tell them like oops something went wrong so what the try catch block does is going to try to run all your code inside and if there is an error then it's going to catch this error into the catch block and then you can safely return some information to the user and say something like oops sorry try again okay now in this catch block first we're going to create a new variable called Budd and for that we're going to uh use the Json method on the request object since we're making HTTP request and response now we are receiving the request from the front end the do Json is the method that is going to turn the Json format which is a typical format for how data Transit on the internet we're going to use that to parse the data and make it into a JavaScript object so we can use it inside our API endpoint and this method is asynchronous so we're going we're going to have to use the await keyword which is why we also declare the function as an asan function those asan await keyword are very important especially when you deal with API endpoint because um now between the front end and the back end uh you know we can have like a front end where the user is in New Zealand and my back end could be in the United States and so the data has to Transit from New Zealand to the United States and come back that's why we need this Asun 08 features to execute code where we don't know how long it's going to take okay the next line is called JavaScript object destructuring so this body object has information that we send from the front end we're going to destructure this object and extract those two properties so this refers to http parameters we're sending parameters along with our HTTP request for instance we're going to say like uh this is the counter number uh two or this is counter number three and this is the action increment or decrement those are parameters we pass from the front end to our back end here in this case I am just going to console log something so whenever I press on this button here you'll see that in my console log I see a counter counter one incremented and if I uh downgrade the counter 3 I will have another log that says counter counter 3 decrement of course here this is not the most interesting uh thing you can do with a back end um but you could do a bunch of other things here for instance we could have saved this information in a database we're going to cover database a little bit later you can compute some data like do some math or advanced stuff and you can even call another API like open AI so for instance now if I go to openai API platform um this is made for developers uh you would typically log in or sign up to create an account they'll give you a little uh API key we're going to cover that later as well and then very simply you can just call open AI for instance to summarize a text that was given by a user or to uh fixed typo you can generate photos out of text uh you can do it using their Library so there are two parts first you need to install this open AI package and then you just have to run this code right here uh this is not going to work but just to show you you would just typically run the code like copy past the code they give you right here I would need to import um the the package Etc but you can just run the code just like this right here and then your API endpoint is going to call another API endpoint that was created by open AI that is going to return You Back some data that you can send back then to your front end and you can make bunch of multiple API endpoints calls if you want uh you can go as crazy as you want and this is just as simple as this okay and now finally we need to return information because remember HTTP is made of like a request and a response and since this is the back end we need to return a response so we use the next response object that is given from a next server so it's a little helper for us to send back information to the front end and we said that we want to format the the data we're sending back into a Json format and here we are passing an object with some data in this case I'm passing success true and something interesting too here in the catch block you see we also have the same object of the data we want to pass back to the front end and we also specify something else where we say we give an object and we say status 500 because remember when you make HTTP requests across the internet there is a there are codes like status code uh to say whether or not the request was successful um by default it is too 200 200 means everything went well uh this is by default so this is what we're sending back here uh in this case something went wrong so we want to tell the front end that something ran really wrong that's why we're sending the status 500 okay so this is for the API part now for the front end we want to tie uh the click of this button to the call to the API so this is what I have done first I have created a new stateful variable called is loading this is going to be used in order to uh show a loading state to the user so what I want to do is when the person clicks on the button I want to put everything on hold like wait we're loading information we're sending this information to the back end wait a minute and then when the information comes back to the front end then we want to say okay it went well you can Cod it again I am using it inside of the the two buttons we have created uh this disabled attribute if it's true then the unclick event listener will not be triggered so if is loading is true this button will do nothing we can use this to prevent people from double clicking on buttons for instance so I also have updated the unclick event listener I am not going to run code inside right away I'm going to call a function that I created called handle counter action and I am passing parameters like one parameter so that the function knows if it's a plus or a minus button here I pass decrement and here I pass increment so this function here is this one right here it is of course an asychronous function because we're going to call the back ends so we don't know how long that's going to take so we have to make it asynchronous in order to be able to use the await keyword it received the parameter action so we know if it's a decrement or an increment function and the first thing we want to do is to uh set the loading uh state to true so that the user cannot double click on the button then we have a nice TR catch block and there is another part in the TR catch block called finally which is going to execute after the try or the catch block is done but no matter what this will be executed after try and catch and because here no matter if you got an error or not we want to set the loading State back to false so that the people can press the button again in the catch block we just log the error we could have a little popup that says like oh something went wrong or something it's not big deal right here and then in a tri block this is where we make the call to our API endpoint on the front end side to make an HTTP request you're going to use the fetch method this function gets two parameters the first one is the uh API you want to Target so in our case we created SL API SL counter that's why it is here maybe you want to call an API that is not yours or an API that is a different location you can just also add the the actual domain here to call basically any API you want and the second parameter are all the options we're passing uh so this is a big object in the first part we have the method which is very important uh so here it's a post method so we're making a post HTTP request which is exactly the same post as we have here then we have headers um headers are like a kind of like metadata that are uh passed along with HTTP request here we're saying that the information will be of type application. Json this is the format of the data we're sending that's why here we have to uh parse those Json data and turn it into a JavaScript object and we have the most interesting part which is the body the body is uh usually where we pass some information uh to the back end since we're sending Json format we have to use json. stringify uh method in order to turn our object into a Jon a valid Json format and here I want to pass two thing I want to pass the action so increment or decrement the little uh parameter here for this function which going to be a value decrement or increment and I also want to pass the counter ID which is the unique identifier for this counter so counter one counter two counter three so that on my back end I know which counter send me this information and then when we call this function is going to return a response so since we're going to wait for uh the response from the back end uh right after we will have access to the response if it is not okay this is going to invert so if response is not okay then we're going to throw an error so this is automatically going to tell JavaScript to enter the catch block and here we're just going to log the error and then of course if response is okay so the API answered well so everything went well then we're going to update the state the counter State and we're going to increment or decrement the state of the counter and now just like this each of those C Hunter is going to make an API endpoint so is going to call this API endpoint for now we're just logging uh the data inside of the console but you have basically done what developer do most of the time you create a nice front end for you people to interact with you create an API endpoint where you handle those interaction and you make them communicate with each other okay now we are entering the world of databases no matter what you are building on the internet chances are you will need a database at some point we can do very simple thing using database for instance like saving user after they login so that we can retrieve whether or not they're actually like pay users of our service or you can do more advaned stuff like saving logs and information so later you can see what happens in your app a database is like a big bucket where you can put lots of information and retrieve this information really fast usually when you build like complex and advanced software you want to think about how the data works first this is something called the MVC the model view controller the model is the data uh the view is what people see and the controller is how the view updates the data so whenever you have a software ID in mind you always want to think data first so for instance um you wants to build a social network like Facebook you have to think like okay we need users in a database each users has a name an email Etc then we have a list of posts like things that people can write each post has a user associated with it has a published date has a text a description an image Etc and then on top of these data you want to build your API endpoints to update the data and then you want to create the front endend part to call those API end points to update the data this is the typical workflow of a proper engineer to be honest what I love to do is to just create buttons and stuff and then update the data later but I might get cancel for saying this so anyway uh let's study this database I want you to get started ASAP so I am going to give you again access to a free preview of my course we're going to cover how databases work and how do we connect it with our API for instance uh we're going to talk about Atlas which is a service that lets you deploy a database because uh we need to actually have a server on the internet that we can store a bunch of data and Atlas is the one we're going to be using and of course I forgot to mention but we are going to use the mongodb type of database I'm going to explain why and what is the difference between this database and other types of databases uh we're going to install a little software called mongodb Compass to help us visualize our data right here on our machine and finally we're going to create a little helper function uh so that whenever we are inside of one of our API endpoint we can easily connect to our database to easily write or retrieve information before we start writing any lines of code let's understand the overall architecture of a database how do we call a database so your clients a user a visitor will always make request to your web server the web server right now is uh the little program running on your computer later it will be running somewhere in the cloud so that anyone can access your app at the moment we don't do anything complicated the web server is basically compiling your react components creating an HTML page and sending back to the clients but at some point we want to do some more Advance operations like the user maybe is asking for the dashboard page where they have access to some of their private information which in this case we have to access the database the database is a place where it's another server and it's a place where you only store data you don't pretty much don't do anything else it has an API key called a connection string that lets anyone with a key do anything on the database so we never want to make a direct connection from the client to the database we want to do that connection from our web server to the the actual database so for instance if the user is asking for the dashboard page with uh his private information our app will process this information create all the react component with some empty data and then it's going to ask the database um we need this information about that user get those information put that information in the HTML page and send it back to the client this is pretty much how any database on the internet work there are two types of databases SQL for structured query language and nosql for non structured query language SQL databases um are databases that are more um as the name suggests structured where it's a little bit like a spreadsheet where you have columns um and headers where each data is labeled so every user has a name every user has an age and things like that we're going to go with a nosql where it's more flexible where the data is stored as um a little bit like JavaScript object but the big difference is that we don't necessarily need to have an a name an age and a hobby for each users we can have a user uh with Hobbies we can have a users with no hobbies and another value as a job for instance uh it's much more flexible and for this lesson we're going to choose mongodb as our database which is a nosql database it's one of the most popular nosql database in the world and you will see it's very simple now just a little bit of wording with mongodb uh what we call a document is a little piece of data for instance when we save a user in our database we would create a new document um it's written in Json format that we've studied before so you would have opening curly braces and closing curly braces and then you would have a set of key value the you can have different types um as we've studied before you can have a string you can have a number you can have a Boolean you can even have an array or an object when we have multiple documents with similar values it's called a collection for instance in our database we'll have a collection of users and you can create a collection for pretty much anything you want you can create a collection for um let's say you have a marketplace with uh jobs available you can create a collection for jobs um you have uh access to the Twitter database there might be a collection for a list of tweets um it goes on and on and then all the collections combined together form our database normally for any business you create you would have one database if you create a new business you would have a new database and from time to time if you want to test something on one of your app you can create two databases for one of your app so if you break the test database the production database is still okay for our database we are going to go with the mongodb atlas to host the database and they have a free plan so we're going to get uh advantage of that you're going to go on the website link and click try for free then create an account and I'll see you on the other side then you will end up on this page just fill the information with whatever feels right it doesn't really matter and then we're going to start creating our first database you want to go with the m0 type of database it is free you want to disable the preload sample data set we want an empty database and pick region of um somewhere in North America it is where the actual database will be and it's important to choose something in the North America because it's likely that it is where our web server the brain of our app will be also hosted so we want to minimize the distance between the two and then you can just create a deployment and you might have to uh face a little capture okay you will arrive on this page and to connect to your database also called a cluster you will need to set set up a username and a password then you can just create a database user so these users that I just created will have access to the database and you can say choose a connection method you can choose uh compath for now and we're just going to do this you're just going to copy that uh little complicated URL that we have here put it somewhere in a notepad or something we're going to need it later and then you can click done and you should be good to go we need to set up a little thing so on the left side go to the network access uh setting and then add an IP address and you will say allo access from anywhere and then confirm the fact that we allow any IP from the internet to access our database does not mean that they can do anything they still need to have credentials to access the database the IP verification thing is just an extra layer of security that we need to remove because if you go to a coffee shop for instance your IP will change and you will need to every time update your IP in the database and also later when we're going to deploy our application to production we will not be the one accessing the database it will be our web server that will access the database and we don't necessarily know the IP of the web server so it's much easier to allo any IP to access the database and just verify using the credentials okay then you can go back to the database and we're going to explore a little bit this part uh this thing called cluster zero is your actual uh cluster it's a little it's a physical physical space somewhere in uh Oregon in the US uh where you own a little part of a server and your database is hosted so let's uh browse The Collection see what we have in there and normally your database should be completely empty so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add my own data I'm I'm just doing it to show you you don't have to follow along with that uh the database name uh we're going to call it let's say production and I can create a collection in this database and let's say we're going to create a collection called jobs and here we go we are in the database called production we are in the collection of jobs we can create multiple Collections and we can also insert document in each of those collections I'm going to insert a job of the title entrepreneur in the database and here we go we just created our first document in our database you'll notice that we have this Dash ID equal um a long string of characters uh this is something that is proper to mongod that's how they identify unique documents that's what makes them super fast to search across millions of documents you don't really want to touch any of this it's added by default and we're going to use it later to retrieve uh and edit documents okay now we want to install something called compass mongodb compass so go to the link below and click download now here you will have to choose uh your type of platforms by default I think it knows which one you're using then click download uh follow the instruction to to install the application and once you're done open it and you will end up in a page that looks like this one we want to connect to our database for that you're going to pass the string we copied previously uh this thing here is basically the key the API key to your database anyone with this can do anything on your database that's why it has to remain private in mongodb it's called a connection string it always have this structure this little piece of text here then the username uh column and then the password ATS and then the URL to your database if you ever forget this link just go back to Cloud uh click connect and then uh when you click Compass it will tell you the actual connection uh string and if you ever forget your password then in this case you would have to recreate a new user so for that you will go to database access and then you would edit the actual user so my user name is Mark Lon uh you would edit the password you cannot change it so you have to create a new one you can autogenerate one and then you would have a new password for the same username and you would copy past those details right here okay now we can connect so now we are connected on the database you'll see on the left we have different types of databases uh admin confing and local are stuff that are added by default you don't want to touch any of those and we're going to go to the production one since I already created The Collection jobs uh it's displayed here if you want to have fun you can create a one just to play around and I'm going to do this with you I'm going to say it's maybe users and then create collections I'm going to add a user I'm going to add those information to the user uh since it's using Json format you always want to write the key with quotes uh at the beginning and at the end and then you can write either uh text or uh numbers or booleans I'm going to click insert and now I have a new collection of users with one document and then I can do a bunch of things if I want to retrieve a user I will have to pass a query so I would have to write um curly braces and then the name of the value I want to filter so is entrepreneur column and then true and then when I press enter is only going to return documents where the uh key is entrepreneur is true and you can do a bunch of other really cool stuff like for instance I want to find users where the age is greater or equal to 30 so I can use this little syntax here and uh press enter and it's going return those users If instead a wrate 40 it's going to return uh no other users because I am not 408 and by double clicking on any value you can edit their value and you can also check the type of data that are stored in a database so the email is a string the age is int 32 is an integer so kind like a number aoan etc etc and recently with the new boom of AI you have this generate query feature um you might have to log in to your account again so that it works um it's a quick overview here but basically you can speak in natural language and it's supposed to give you back the type of query you're supposed to run so let's try with this find users where age is lower than 40 and it generated this uh little query here and if I press f is going to query those user as we build our application we're going to go a little bit deeper about how to retrieve and how to edit data in the database for now you have a rough overview and you can visualize all the data with mongodb compass okay so now that we know how to edit our database with our hands and our eyes let's do this with code for that we'll need to add our connection string somewhere in our application and because it's a very sensitive data we want to do it in something called environment variable so the first thing you want to do as the root of your project you want to create a m. local and I'm going to put it in the root there we go and here you want to first name the variable I'm going to call this URI you can call it the way you want just make sure it's capital letters and there's no space if you want to add a space you need to add a dash then equal and then the value uh that we get previously from mongodb we can save the file and try to understand a little bit what is going on here first you'll notice that inside of the git ignore file there is this thing that says do environments. loal are basically ignored by git which mean that anything you put in here will never be pushed to get so it's a safe place to put everything that is secure in your app so the connection string uh your stripe API key to process payments your API key to send emails uh we'll study that later but this is the place where you're going to put every sensitive information you'll also notice that we're not writing JavaScript we're not importing anything not exporting anything um it's it's a very different structure than we've studied before it's something very specific to nodejs okay to understand how to get this value in the code so we can uh query our database uh I'm going to log the value of it process. do the name of your variable and if you do this and look at the console you will see that I actually get the value right here is because we have this script running on the computer npn run Dev and it's basically looking at any environment uh file so a file that starts with do NV EnV and then every uh variable that he finds there is going to add it inside of the process. environment object and so if you want to call it in the code you would have to do process. do the name of the variable okay and just as a security uh thing here we are doing this command inside of a react server component so this is going to be logged in the S side of the server and not available on the client but if you reference the variable somewhere in the code and you put it in here you'll see that we can actually see the variable the fact that this variable is inside of this do environment file uh doesn't mean it's invisible to users it just mean that it's not going to be sent on GitHub and so it's staying on your local machine okay so I'm going to delete that part because this is pretty dangerous to do and um let's recap really quick so this uh do environment file is the place where you put every sensitive information you have in your app there are two main advant ages the first one is that it's the file is staying on your local machine it's not going to be sent to GitHub and the second is that we can have different values based on the environment our application is running let me show you what I mean by this here we are working on our computer we are building new features we're testing things so we want to make sure we work on a separate database as the one that will be used by our customers so these connection string here is going to connect to the cluster and if we had slash and then a name whatever name you want after I usually called M Dev and by doing this we're going to connect specifically on the dev database on the cluster and in production where our app is running on versal instead of having Dev we can just say prod and so that we connect to two different databases with the exact same variable name so for now I'm going to name this one de you can call it development you can call it the way you want and I'm going to use that thing here I'm going to go to my project unversal in the settings part there is something called environment variable and this this is the equivalent of your uh environment file on your local machine but this one is hosted on versal and here is where you would add your environment variable the key is what's before the equal sign and the value is what is after so you can copy past the value and instead of having the SL Dev we're going to say SLR and then when you save the project now this variable will be available inside of your project hosting on versal and so now when we are working on our computer this uh function that will connect to the database is going to use the mongodb URI we have in the environment. local because we are on our computer and when it's going to be deployed in production on versal it's going to use the value that we just set up in versal so that we can keep the exact same code and have two different values for the same variable and you will see that it's common for developers to work on one database when you are coding and to work on another database for the production values a quick note on environment variables you might have heard in the past API Keys API Keys API Keys what are API Keys usually an API key is like a unique identifier so that you as a developer can identify yourself for the service you're using for instance let's say you want to use the chpt uh like open AI API when you sign up they will give you an API key and you will use that as a developer when you make request to the open AI API those are extremely private you always want to keep it for you and the envirment variable file is usually a good place to put all of your API Keys okay now we need to connect to our database in the code for that we'll need a little package called mongodb so just pop up your terminal and stop the current process you can press uh contrl C or command C and run npm e short for installed mongod DB press enter and when the packaging is installed uh let's restart the development server so npn run Dev and we're good to go now we need to customize the bridge to pass for instance our connection string um so we will will customize a function so we can reuse that function everywhere in the code uh so we can update our database anytime it's a good thing to separate different type of functions in your code um so what we're going to do we're going to create a new folder inside of the root directory called Libs short for Library some people call it utilities uh you can call it the way you want I just like the word lips and then we're going to create a DJs file this will be the file responsible uh to connect with our database and instead of writing some very boring code uh let's use the code base I created for you just uh use the link below uh you will end up on this page you can just copy and pass the code in JS okay so the reason we're copy pasting this code instead of writing it ourselves is because it's very Advanced uh because it's very boring and also because you will never touch this code it's only specific to this project once we've created this we'll never touch it again instead I'm going to break down a few pieces for you so first at the top we import the mongod DB client so the bridge to mongodb from the package we just installed then we have this if condition so the process. environment dot is that things that let us access environment variable on our computer the URI is the one that we have in the environment. local right here and then when we when we try to evaluate if and then a variable is going to return true if the variable exists it's going to return false if it doesn't exist and the exclamation mark is going to reverse that value so if this does not exist if we did not add the value somewhere in our project then this is going to return false and we're going to reverse it with the exclamation mark which means this becomes true and then we enter this line and then we're going to throw an error we're going to go over that uh in the next part of the but basically this is going to make the code crash so that if you forget to add this uh to your project uh the code the app here will uh show you a big error message then we do const URI equal uh the name of the variable so we're just reassigning the value of this uh mongodb URI inside of a shorter uh variable something the name is just a little bit more friendly then we have another variable which is a JavaScript object with some options um this is just how do we connect to the database this is some like really advanced stuff and then we create those two variables uh with the let keyword the let keyword just mean that uh later uh in this file we'll probably update the variable give it different values it's not a constant and then we have a big if else statement the if else statement is going to check if that is true um the process. environment is what we've talked about earlier the node - EnV is a very popular environment variable it's been given uh by default when we run the project with nextjs is going to set these to the actual uh environment and the environment remember it could be either development on your computer or production on the web machine the web server somewhere on the internet so what this line does is basically is checking if we are running the code on your computer or on the online server and the reason we do that is because on our computer it's a little bit different how things are handled uh as you're editing code and you save and it's refresh the entire code um it's a bit different from the server where instead we're just going to deploy the code once and it's going to be running forever this is very advance but what it says is basically create a connection with a database and if we save the file and then we refresh everything keep the connection open instead of killing the connection and reopening one it's just a matter of performance again this is very Advanced uh you really don't want to get into this this is not important the only important line here is this one where we have the clients the variable we declared previously and equal to new mongodb clients the mongodb client is what we import from mongodb at the top this is the driver that let us connect and we give it two things we give it the URI which is this thing so basically we give it the connection string the keys to our database and we give it uh an object of options with a few uh parameters which in this in our case it doesn't really matter so this thing is basically a bridge to let us connect to our database using JavaScript and that's why we have the line here client. connect and then we have this line export default client promise and so this uh variable here is equal to client. connect so we exporting a little JavaScript object that is connecting to the database so now the thing that matters is how do we use it to connect to the datab base uh in our code you can save the file and close it because we'll never touch it again and then in our page.js it this is just to show you this is not going to work right now but this is just to show you a glimpse it's as simple as this first we need to import the client promise that object we just created that has the keys to our database we import it from the lebs uh folder inside of the JS file and then um we we say something like um do DB to say we want to connect to a database and then do connection for the connection we want to check and then we can have something like do find with some parameters to do exactly the same things we were doing before all right so having a database is nice but if we could actually use the database it's even better and for that we're going to authenticate user so whenever we talk about login sign in sign up sign out log out whatever uh this is what roughly authenticating users mean so after this section users will be able to create an account we're going to save this user information like name emails inside of our database and then we will be able to check if the person is actually a user of our application to let some people do some actions like access their private dashboard or some people not access the dashboard because they have not yet created an account user authentication is something that is extremely popular on the internet so there are already bunch of developers who build open source project that are working really well and for that we're going to use one called oath. JS if you search o DS on the internet you will find this website you can click get started and follow the tutorial for whatever framework you're using in our case we're using nextjs so first you need to install uh next oath at beta and then you need to run this little common it's basically going to give you a little token like a unique identifier that we're going to use later to Hash some information to encrypt our information it's not a big deal you'll see and then it'll tell you a few things you need to do if you want to follow along with me and make sure you have all the steps completed um in your SL API folder you should have created an O folder and then you should have created this like a little bit complex do do do dot next o folder and inside you have a route. JS and you should have this code inside this means OJs is going to create a set of API endpoints for you so that you can use that to authenticate users you should also have add your uh unique um secret key that you generated earlier in the environment. loo and you should have at the root of your project an oath. JS file this is basically like the control center of OJs here you have a list of all your uh providers for now it should be empty the providers we're going to cover that later is basically how our users are going to uh log to our app so that could be using email like magic links or email and password or they can be using social providers like Google Facebook GitHub and then we should have an adapter an adapter is where we are going to save the user information in this case we're using the mongodb adapter because we are going to save the user information inside of our database all right now your project is set up it's important to understand roughly how user authentification work on the Internet it's it's pretty much the same thing whatever app you're using so for that let me show you a quick video of how everything works so when our client visitors of our website are going to the loging page of our site our server is going to give them back a signin HTML page this page will will have several options to login um email Facebook uh Google uh anything will set up for now it's it's empty because we haven't configured anything in OJs the type of login we choose is called a provider so we can have a provider for Google we can have a provider for Facebook for instance on this page the user can click on a type of logging they want or enter their emails and password for instance this is going to make a post request to our / apios signin and point and it's going to pass some parameters so if they sign up with an email it's going to send that email if they trying to sign up with Google is going to say type Google and our server is going to receive that request and going to process it if the user picked a social login for instance login with Facebook then our server is going to communicate with Facebook to make sure that the user actually exists and then our server is going to communicate our with our database so mongodb first is going to check if the person actually exists and for that we're going to use emails so wherever a user sign up with we need an email so if it's a email and password we have the email if it's a magic link uh where people receive an email and then they click a login link to be logged on the app then we also have the email and if the person use a social provider like Google or Facebook both of those services will give us the person email so that in our database OJs can check if the person exists if the person doesn't exist then uh OJs is going to create a new documents inside of our database so we store this information and then OJs is going to create a little session for the user the session is just another document that we will store in our database it's a very simple document that has a unique token so unique identifier so that we can easily retrieve the user it also has an expiry date which is usually 30 days that's why sometimes when you log in to a service after 30 days they ask you to log in again and we'll use this session in order to verify that the user actually has access so our server is going to send back this session to our client the visitor and he going to put the session inside of a cookie we're going to study cookies in the next lesson the purpose of putting the session token inside of the cookies is that first it's persistent so if the user close the tab and uh open a new tab to log to our app the cookies is still there and the cookie will be sent to every request the person makes to our server so that we can easily identify them and the user will be redirected usually to a dashboard page or an app page and after this process every time the user will make a request to our server whether to get a new page or to um call an API endpoint the cookie will automatically be sent so that's our server will receive the cookie and it can easily check if the cookie that contains the session token is actually in the database and it's not expired we talked about cookies what are cookies they are small piece of data that are sent by web servers like your API for instance to an internet browser and then your internet browser is going to store this data somewhere on your computer or on your phone C cookies are used everywhere in the internet they're used for things like tracking analytics they're used for user preference sometimes you see like a model on the page and you say I don't want to see this anymore and then it's going to set a cookie that says the user doesn't want to see this anymore so never show it again in our case we're using cookies in order to store the session token data so that we know whether the user has access to our application or not let me show you this example this is a website that I built that is also using OJs if you want to see your cookie you can just open the developer console and go to the application Tab and under the cookie you will normally see the domain name of your site and if you click it you will see all the cookies that are being stored by this website and if I click on the secure OJs session token you'll see that the value is long sequence of characters so that now every time I make a request on the site whether I navigate to a new page or ask an API endpoint I'm also sending this little uh piece of data to uh the inso website and on the back end when the to receive the request from the person they also receive the cookie value and they can decide uh anything they want they can check if the cookie exist if they can check if the cookie is not expired and they can perform some actions like if the cookie is expired ask the user to log in again if the Cookie doesn't exist then we have the user to sign up uh there are a bunch of actions that we'll cover later okay now let's be practical and talk about some use cases of authentification inside of our app things like signing out signing up protected Pages private API Etc okay so this is one of my nextjs projects uh not the one I showed you earlier but it works exactly the same way I have the same system for all of my apps so here um when I navigate to my domain name or local / apios SL signin users will end up on this page where they will have multiple options to sign in to my applications this is done automatically for me by OJs I have nothing to do besides sending up the providers information so here I have created a provider for Google I have created a provider for email we're going to do that later this is what you set up here in this providers array in .js file they have tutorials to help you set up any kinds of providers you want so you want to check out their documentation once they sign up or sign in here this information the information they give me here will be saved in the database I will get at least their emails and if they sign up with Google I'll also get their names and the profile picture they use for their Google accounts so for instance here if I add my email and I stand up with uh email then because I am using the mongodb adapter from OJs with just this line of code in my database I am going to see the user Mark gmail.com created it's going to add a unique identifier field is also going toh check if I verify my email if I click the link inside of my email we're going to cover that later so I have this information saved in my database then what I do I redirect people after they successfully sign up to a SL dashboard page this is a private and protected page only for people who sign up and the code is actually very simple what you see here on the screen on the right side is basically just this like little uh jsx code right here and no matter which user is going to my app it is the exact same code it's basically like a template that I fill with the data that was generated by the user so this is the page.js file you see here so this is the typical nextjs file I export this react components I return some GSX and here uh there is a function that I created so get user this function right here that is executed so whenever someone go to my/ dashboard page this function is executed and this function first call the oath function that is created by OJs with this single line of code what OJs is going to do in the background is going to check if the person has the right cookies so if the person successfully signed up to my app and if that's the case it's going to create a little session object with some information but if the session does not exist and the person has never actually created an account for my application then they are going to be redirected to the homepage of my website so for instance now if I go uh if I open an incognito tab where I have no cookies it's like I am a new user and if I go to the SL dashboard press enter and boom I am redirected to the homepage of my site and with just those uh three lines of code I am able to uh either show information to the right people who sign up to my service or don't show anything at all and because this is a react server component uh this is a safe place to do all the checkup verify that the user is authenticated so that's uh people who are not will never actually see the content inside okay now let's assume the person has created as um an account so they are authenticated they have an actual session object uh OJs is going to populate the session object with some information so if I go to session. user. ID this is the exact same thing as this ID here inside of my database and that way I can simply retrieve the user from my database using the session of the user the actual authentification St of the user and I can find the right information about the user in this case I find the user boards those little uh cards here um so that anyone who goes to my app who has already signed up will see different information because everyone will have a different uh session user ID and so I will retrieve only the information about the actual user who is now browsing my site and I'm going to populate the content the visual part of my app with what I retrieve from the database that I got from the unique user session ID this is how you make a page private in your application now let's say that I want to protect an API endpoint like let's say this post function inside of/ API board then I would do the exact same thing I would retrieve the session and if the session does not exist then I will just return uh an an error like a an HTTP response with a status code of 401 and that's pretty much how the entire authentification system work how you make uh protect pages and private apis endpoint for your users how you you create one page that can display different kinds of information based on the actual users who signed up and how you reject people from your app if you don't want them uh to visualize or see some information all right now it is very likely that after authenticating users you will need to send emails so there are two types of emails in the world transactional and marketing emails the marketing emails is the one usually you don't like to receive as a person uh they are U companies who broadcast one message to thousands of users like a discount for a product or a Black Friday deal and the ones we are interested in as developers are the transactional emails so we can send magic links when people want to log in to our service for that I'm going to leave you with a little preview of my Cod fast course where we're going to select a provider a service to send those emails and how to set up your DNS record in order for uh your domain to be able to send those emails there are many providers out there there is mail gun which is very famous and there is a recent which is a fairly new but it's very fr and they have a free plan so we're going to go with this one click the button get started and create an account once you signed up you will go to The Domain part and click add a domain here you will enter your domain name and we're going to send email from a sub doain so I'm going to write something like recent. cfast sas.com it's important to use a subdomain because if someone managed to hike your system and send uh thousands of emails to uh people who don't even exist with your root domain it might damage your domain reputation so instead we're going to to use a subdomain so that uh if something goes wrong it's just the subdomain reputation that is being impacted you can say whatever uh I usually use the name of the service I'm using you can say email you can say mail you can just say e this is totally up to you and then keep North Virginia for the location and then add the domain resent is going to send emails on our behalf so we need to verify that we own this actual domain So Below there is a list of all the D records we need to add so first there is an MX record with uh send. your subdomain with this value you can copy those and go back to your name chip account or whatever you use like GoDaddy uh for uh your domain name and then uh in the DNS panel that we've seen earlier the advanced DNS tab you will be able to add those records in name chip there is no option for MX record here is just a little bit below in that category in the mail settings instead of email forwarding you can go and choose custom MX and then you can add your own custom MX records so then I add exactly what they ask me the host the value and the priority of 10 and I can save the changes then I can go back to resent and do the exact same thing for all the records so send. resend as a text record with this value so I can go back here and find the txt records and I can save this one and I'll do again for this other one right here add a new record txt and press save and the final one the DeMark record which is another txt records and so I'm going to go here txt and press save and the reason we're using those text records which are commonly known in the email word as dkim SPF and DeMark records is to tell um email providers like Gmail that we are legit so that our emails don't end up in spam okay so now that we've added all the records we can verify the DNS records it could take a while uh it could take sometimes up to a few hours uh DNS records are pretty slow to update um just make sure after an hour or two if it's still not verified to make sure that you've entered the exact same values as they show here since my domain is verified now I'm going to go to the API Keys section and I'm going to create an API key you would normally call it the name of your project so for mine it will be code fast SAS and then for the access uh select sending access and then the domain we just added and then click add and copy that key then go back to the code editor and the file. m. local add a little key called recent Das key or whatever you want but just make sure you use the word recent so you remember what it is and then equal and then add the key right here this little sequence of character is called an API key is basically the key to your resend account so that you can send emails from your code and make sure you never share this key with anyone otherwise uh they can send email on your behalf and you can save the file and close it and now you're ready to send any emails to anyone now just to show you an example of how you would do so in the recent documentation there is something called API reference and you can check they have something called send email right here and they show you for a node js project how to send an email and it's as simple as this you will have to download their Library so npm installed recent and then you import their object then you give the API key we just created to that object so we have a client or a bridge to send email and then with just this lines of code you can send an email to pretty much anyone every developers SL business owners have different needs on emails but I wanted to show you a quick example of how I use emails for some of my apps so uh here on the left this is a file where whenever someone purchase one of my product this code is being executed there is a part where I send the customer an email like a welcome email to send them a unique link so that they can sign up to the app and also how to get started and this uh this here is a function that I created myself called send email uh this is what you see on the right side and so in this send email function I am calling the typical recent API we just watched earlier where I pass from to subject text HTML and a bunch of other things and I export this function send email from this file so that anywhere in my app I can just do await send email the name of the the EMA email of the person uh the subject line and the content inside of the email and I can send literally an email to anyone and the part you're probably going to need emails the most is when people try to sign in using emails they're supposed to receive a magic link when they click on this button and for that I am using the provider the recent Provider from uh OJs our o user authentification uh Library we talked about earlier and with just this single line of code here where I give OJs the access to my uh recent account through the API key they are able to send an email to anyone who input their emails here that looks like this uh where if people click they will then be uh logged in authenticated into our applications in this case you don't even have to customize the emails you just have to have this line of code inside of your OJs file and uh OJs is going to do all the work of crafting the emails preparing the unique link for your customers to click on and all you have to do is to give OJs your recent API ke all right now we are entering the most exciting part of the course the part where we're going to set up a little pricing system for our application to charge money on the internet you will need a payment provider uh the two ones that are pretty famous at the moment are stripe and lemon squeezy I personally use stripe but it's not available for every countries out there for instance if you're watching from India uh you might have to settle for lemon squeezy because they will let you open a lemon squeezy account before we talk about the Practical things I want to give you a few unsolicited piece of advice the first one is that in order to open a stripe account you will need to have a business that could be a freelancer business that could be a legit uh company like an LLC or something but you will need a business now your business does not have to be in the country you're living in you can have an offshore company be careful with that because um it is very tempting to open a 0% tax offshore company in Delaware USA I've seen lots of people doing that but you have to be extremely PR cautious with what your countries allows you to do or not because in some countries you would have a double taxation so you're going to be taxed 0% of your us company but you will be taxed by your country on your US income so be careful with these kind of things you want to make sure you always ask chpt uh where you leave what kind of business you're running what kind of company you intend to open and ask jgpt what are the rules what is the double taxation saying about that uh make sure you do things really properly from the day Zero because you really don't want to go into legal issu the number one reason we're doing this internet thing is to have as most Freedom as we can and there's nothing worse than being engage in some legal stuff so do things properly from Day Zero okay and another question I get asked all the time is uh how do I handle my strap accounts with the company so I have one company that hold all the strap accounts for all of my businesses so in my case I have multiple businesses and for each business I have one stripe account per business that is under the company name and one final piece of advice about pricing for your software your digital product uh you always want to price a little higher than what you think is right because it's a tendency I see in developers to underprice themselves uh you're amazing you're doing uh something that most people don't you're shipping something on the Internet your time deserves to be paid well so make sure you price your product well uh pricing is marketing those are two are really correlated I made a video an entire video uh dedicated to pricing I add a link into the description if you want to watch it that's going to help you uh choose your pricing system okay now before we start coding our checkout and subscription system we need to understand how stripe or demon cuzi is going to integrate with our software both of the payment processing platforms are going to give us some kind of like user interface elements such as like a checkout page where users can input emails and credit card Etc that we're going to show to our clients this page is going to communicate directly with a payment processor which is going to process the request for instance charge the credit card and create a subscription and the payment processor is going to send us back some events to confirm what just happened something like uh that user just pay the invoice we're going to tell the payment processor to send those events on our API so we can update our database and do things like granting or removing access to the product for a specific user we can also update the user information Etc and in the background our payment processor is also going to execute some other tasks so for instance if we set up a subscription at the end of each month the payment processor is going to try to charge that credit card of user again without us having to do anything now let's dig a little bit deeper inside of the payment processor Solutions those again it's either stripe or Leoni both are working in similar fashion there are two main categories of things we will touch the first one is the product so if we compare your software with a library of books a product could be a book it's the item or the service you sell and the price SLV variance the price is the word in stripe and the variance is the word in lemon squeezy is like a version of your product for instance a PDF book uh a Kindle version of your book a physical version of your book you get it and the other part is the web hook events those are notification or messages whatever we want to call them that are sent from the payment processor back to our server our API to let us know about some information that happens for instance a customer just pay the invoice or the last payment of that customer failed etc etc okay so no matter if you are running a subscription business a onetime payment digital product or a advance SAS with meted usage the payment flow is always very similar there's a part where users can interact with uh your front end so like let's say they wants toh create a checkout or they wants to access their customer protal to uh update their building information cancel a subscription download an invoice Etc and there's another part called the web book where it's more like invisible things happening in the background we're we're going to cover that later so first the part where people can interact with your system for instance like creating a checkout uh for one of your products they will be able to click a button this click will return a URL for uh in my case stripe and then here uh people will be able to input their credit cards and subscribe to a plan that you have on for your software or just buy a digital product for instance this is usually done in two part there's the front end and the back end the first thing you will need to do is to create a product in stripe in the of the software I just showed you I have a bunch of plans so I have a bunch of products but you could have technically just one and then uh this is the code of what I just showed you one more time um this is a simple button so you can see it's a it's a react component that when people click it's going to trigger this function and this function is basically going to make an a call to my API and the API endpoint is right here on the right side uh here first I need to check if the user is authenticated because I don't let people who are not authenticated to my app make a payment and then I'm going to use the stri API to create a checkout uh in the stripe API call I give stripe the price ID of the product customers want to subscribe to I also give a client reference ID which is a unique identifier that I will use later in the webbook part the invisible part to retrieve information about that user so that when stripe tell me oh this customer just made a purchase I know exactly which customer in my database that is and then I get back a URL from stripe which I sent back to my front end and in my front end when I get the response here here I open a new window to that URL I got from stripe and this is why after clicking the button customer end up on this checkout. stripe.com so that they can start a subscription for my app in the case you want to have a customer portal which I recommend where customers can update their uh credit card information they can download invoice Etc uh you can use customer stripe customer portal it works exactly like the stripe checkout you make a call to the stripe API they're going to give you back a link and they're going to create um a page for your customers with all their information so your customer will be able to see the credit card they use to make a checkout they will be able to uh see their billing history they will be able to cancel their plan even change the plan so that they can perform any form of like a billing settings this is great we can create checkout for our users but now you want to give access to the product to your users for that we're going to use the stripe webbook events so in the developer tab inside of the webbook uh part you will be able to add webbook endpoints a webbook endpoint is basically like a little API we're going to create to listen for events from stripe so for instance when a person completes a checkout we want stripe to let us know inside of our webbook endpoint that a customer XYZ completed a payment so that we can give them access to the product when you add an endpoint you add you have to add the URL of your API so that could be domain.com AI stripe and you have to choose the events you want to receive they have really a bunch of events I think over 100 so you want to select only the one that you need let's check the code for that so for instance this is one of the webbook endpoint for one of my software I put it in the/ API SL webbook route and here I have a simple function this is just a regular API endpoints like we used to do previously and in the first part we want to make sure that this uh only stripe can send us events so we want to verify that the person making a call to this endpoint is actually stripe that's why there's a little part of the code here that stripe will give you when you set up your account uh we use that to verify the source of the event and then we get the event data from stripe and we are going to iterate over which type of event no matter what you are running whether it's a software it's a digital product no matter what usually the checkout session completed is the number one event you want to listen for this is the part where you would typically give access to your product a checkout. session. completed means someone went to like a a proper stripe checkout they input the credit card details and successfully completed the checkout and if you remember from the previous part when I created the checkout I would give a client reference ID to stripe and now stripe is going to attach this client reference ID to the data that I get from the events so that I can just use that to retrieve the user from my database and in my case what I do usually is I have an as access Boolean on my database that is either true or false and it becomes true only if the person has completed a checkout to use the customer portal the that part that page where people can update their credit card details Etc I also save the customer ID I get from stripe inside of the user and here you can do pretty much anything you want you could send an events to the customer that say thank you for your purchase here is the unique link to uh download the book uh you just purchased you can literally it's an API endpoint so you can literally do anything you want and if you're running a digital product this checkout doation and completed type of event will get you as far as you want now if you're running a more advanced like maybe like a software with a SCP subscription system uh this check out the session that completed uh same could be used in order to give access to the product but now if the person has canceled their subscriptions they stop paying or their credit card stopped working you want to revoke access to your product and for that you can listen for the customer. subscription. deleted event here stripe again will send you some information about the customer so they could be the client reference ID or they can be the actual customer ID so you can retrieve the customer for your database and what I do in my case is if the person has a deleted subscription then I'm just going to remove the as access I'm going to turn it to false and in the front end part the visual part of my app whenever they try to do something I check if has access is true if that's the case I let them use my software if not then I just revoke access I redirect them to the homepage or I send them back an error that says that you need to subscribe to my service in order to use it stripe really has a bunch of uh events that you can listen to um don't go too crazy with it because it can become really complicated those two events will get you really far uh there's another one that's really good for marketing which is the checkout session EXP HED which basically if someone create a checkout session but did not complete the session so they uh they abandon the cart that what they call it in eCommerce uh stripe would let you know that and sometimes they would have include their emails and you can send them back an email that says hey I noticed you didn't finish the payment uh you can ask them question why they didn't complete the payment or you can then send them a coupon so they come back to your site or whatever by now you have a pretty solid understanding of what you need to know in order to build a software there is nonetheless a part that is pretty important about security how to make your app secure to make sure that there is no data leaks or to make sure that the users has access to the right information Etc are you're lucky after 2024 there are a bunch of AIS that are in your code that are going to help you understand uh if something is wrong or not so what I really really really recommend you to do is to open a chat with an AI inside of your code base give it access to the entire workspace and then ask question so in this case I ask a very basic question which might not cover everything but you can ask AI to review your entire code and ask if there is a security issue somewhere and you can go deep and ask specific questions this is very important to do this because AI will be able to review the entire code base really quickly and able to flag some very important things which is going to save you a bunch of headaches there are a few part that are important about Security in this case of our project we have the one about react server versus client components as we mentioned earlier everything in this project is a react component and and by default those components are server components so they're rendered on the server where it's safe to do some kind of operations and if we turn them into a client component by adding use client at the top then they are rendered on the clients and so simply put client components are not a safe space to do some sensitive operations you want to use client components for stuff where people can click on buttons but you want to make sure that in those clients component you never perform some kind of operation like a database query for instance so make sure you always do datab B connections and all forms of like sensitive operation things that people should not be aware of on server side components in this case this is the page that renders the dashboard you see on the right side here I have this little function that is going to retrieve the user data based on the session of the user so I need to make a database connection and retrieve the user and I have to make sure I do this operation on the server so either on my computer or on the place my server is hosted on the internet but never on the client's side okay we covered this a little bit earlier about envirment variables you want to make sure that your API Keys Etc are stored inside of off. local inside of your computer and add your un variable on your hosting provider when you deploy your code on the internet you want to make sure you use onment variables in order for your code to never be pushed accidentally on the internet here for instance if I do process. of. stripe API key inside of these client components this is a really terrible thing to do because every every person who is going to see a page where there is a button delete dashboard component will be able to see the stripe API key so really really don't do this and then you want to have some form of controls on your API endpoint so whenever a client someone on internet makes a request to one of your API endpoint you want to have like a policeman or whatever this is that checks a few information about the person for instance have you logged into to my app have you paid for the service if you have paid which plans are you on you want to have like a set of control at the top of your API endpoint to make sure that you only allow a specific subset of users to perform some actions for instance this is the API endpoint here to create a record in my database to create a new board like you see on the right side uh here I'm checking a few things if the body does not include a name so the name of the board I am rejecting this API endpoint I also check if the user has a session and if it does not I'm going to kick the user out and then I'm going to retrieve the user from the database and I'm going to check if that person has access or not to my product meaning has the person paid or not and one more time if it does not have access then I'm going to reject this from the API endpoint to make sure that the code below is never executed and finally there what developers calls middleware firewall proxy uh they have different names B on what you need uh but basically they will be like a middleman between your client people making request and your server because uh the client can be a malicious actor and it does not necessarily has to be someone like a a person on the internet like a physical human but that could also be a developer U making request to your API using aot script and in that case they could send like a thousand request to your API endpoint in 1 second this is where you want to have like those firewall proxy middleware that stands in between you and the server to make sure that uh the requests are only sent to your server if they match a certain um conditions for instance you can block access to a certain country or you can use a rate limiter that checks uh how many times this IP address has has requested access to your API endpoint and you can say like if you have done this more than 10 times per minute then I'm going to block access there really are a bunch of things you can do here uh it can get really complex but here you have a global understanding of one of the Core Concepts of security that you want to dig deeper when you deploy your application to make sure everything goes out safe before we talk about how to use AI to code super fast we're going to go over a few advaned concept that are not necessary for you to learn uh but they're pretty handy and useful and I will show you in some of my applications how I use each of them so for nextjs we have the dynamic routes for instance if I go over these tweets you can see that it's under x.com Markus status unique identifier and if I go to this other tweet of mine uh it is the exact same URL except that it has a different identifier in the route this is basically a dynamic route Twitter has built this like a structured page like it's ENT page where uh if I go left or right no matter what which tweet I look look it's going to always look the same on the left but the content inside the actual tweet will be different this is called Dynamic route this is basically like how you create those templates that are empty like structures and then you're going to fit them uh the data so it has a similar uh layout but it has different content this is very helpful if you do some things like SEO for instance uh and then talking about SEO we also have nextjs metadata so for instance this is one of my websites uh metadata are things that are invisible to users like here the title of these website the descriptions and a few keywords etc those are visible for search engines like Google and so you want to make sure you have the minimum metadata for your app to be indexed and referenced by Google nextjs makes it very simple when you export a constant called metadata with title description um URL whatever they will automatically add those tags to your page so that Google can reference you and finally there are the loading screens uh for instance if I go to this page and refresh the page you're going to see that I'll see this like state right now where I have those white cards because the page is actually loading it's not necessary but it gives a little uh clue to user that something is happening when we're actually fetching the data from uh the database so they have something to look at all right now we have uh advaned St CSS classes transition group uh opacity Shadow border all of them are pretty handy uh they will help you make better designs uh the hover one is probably what you are seeing right now when I'm hovering my mouse cursor on this card or that card um this is likely a hover effect from CSS so you might want to learn some of them about react um I think you learned pretty much a good chunk already there is another hook you might have to use from time to time which is use ref and you have this suspense component for JavaScript uh there are a few ones that are important the local storage this is like a mini database inside of your internet browser so for instance uh you can see this is one of my websites it helps people make logos so they can uh change the size of the logo they change the icons they can change the colors Etc what I do as a developer I put stuff inside of their local storage um actually if you open your developer tab you will see inside of application local storage and here logo fast I can see all those things here written are things that I add automatically with JavaScript to the local storage of my users and for instance this is where I save the actual settings of the person so if I reload this page I am going to see the exact same logo that I used to see because it's loading the information from my local storage okay now it's pretty slow because my Wi-Fi is really bad but there we go uh it's loading this uh this apple again from my local storage so people don't have to create an account because all the information is stored inside of their local storage this is very handy when you do like free tools marketings and stuff like that uh we have not covered yet form validation uh so when you have forms like stuff where you people can input stuff uh you can let them input text you can have like a controls where here I'm saying that you can only have maximum 280 characters so here I can press my keyboard but nothing is happening and then you have um methods on uh arrays and objects like sort and find uh which are pretty handy methods uh sorting will help you sort an array based on the certain conditions fine to retrieve one item from an array uh there are a bunch of helpers inside of JavaScript that's going to make your life easier okay I guess we are entering now the most exciting part of this video where we're going to use AI in order to 10x your code output as a developer now if you haven't followed the previous part of this video and you don't know yet how to build a little software by yourself I really really really recommend you to do so before we start using AI uh to code for us because AI is really good at explaining things to help you learn but if you build stuff if you use AI to write stuff that you do not understand you will likely end up in like what people call the AI hell Loop where you're going to be prompting an AI that will make first a good output that looks like you can make a bunch of stuff but as soon as you get stuck a little bit or as soon as you find bugs Etc you'll spend hours prompting the AI to fix stuff which is absolutely not fun so learn the Fundamentals by yourself and start using AI to 10x your output after that okay the first step is to actually set up your AI coding agent inside of your code editor at the moment recording this video there are two uh great code editors the first one is vs code which has an AI option with GitHub copilot this little guy here since it's free I think this is where I recommend you to get started and I am personally using cursor AI uh both are very similar so you can swap back and forth you won't be lost then once you set it up inside of your code editor you will have to choose a llm a large language model uh in my case I use clo 3.5 sonnets uh to be honest don't overthink that pick the popular language models so at this moment GPT 40 is also very famous so just pick one and let's move on to the next part and now it is time to build a deep relationship with your AI let me show you what is my uh workflow with AI to code fast okay now uh you are in your code editor you have an AI so basically you have like a software senior engineer that has the knowledge of your entire app so you can ask the AI to do pretty much anything for you I use this little like inline AI feature uh when I need to change one line of code usually this is what I do for CSS properties and styles so for instance uh this makes no sense but I would say something like uh you know add this CSS property to the div and then I would just review the change and accept it or not uh this also works super well if you go to the web and you like an SVG like this little icon here I like it so I copy past it into my code but it is an HTML uh SVG and I want to turn this into a valid jsx so for react and it's going to do all the brain work of updating uh the right attribute so it's a valid GX okay now for anything that is more than just one or few lines of code I use the chat you can press I think commment plus L to pop it up and I use the chat for almost everything as we have covered in a previous section you can use it if you don't understand a part of the code if you want to learn about a specific function Etc it is very useful for Education it's also useful for brainstorming sometimes I have a feature idea in mind and I asked the AI how would you implement this feature uh here I just this is just an example but normally you want to give more instructions and then you will see what the AI suggest here I will just check what the AI had come up with that give me a little idea of how to implement it then I just keep chatting with the AI in order to get something that I think is worth it and then of course when I'm ready I apply those changes to my code base and I review them step by step something that is very important for this part is the the context the context is basically how much knowledge do you give to the AI about your codebase in this case I gave the contest of page.js so this actual page right here which um for a big feature like this one where I'm like adding a complete new feature to my app is probably not enough that's why sometimes you can just uh do this like you press comment enter and you will give the entire app all the files will be used as context for uh the chat with the AI it's a little bit slower but you will get better results and you can also give like specific lines of code AS context so for instance I can select this SVG and I can say add to chats and now the AI knows exactly which lines of code I'm referring to and it gets better results all right and another thing I love which is called the composer in cursor if you press command I it's going to pop up this window that looks like the chat but it's actually a composer so you have access to like an AI agent so it can run your terminal it can create edit files without you um accepting or not uh this is very powerful you can do really a bunch of stuff but it can also be dangerous because it goes really fast and it change a lot of stuff uh what I do usually I use the this composer thing when I know exactly what I want for instance I already have created some of the components I want to use and I have exact like clear instruction to give to the AI I would use the composer as you keep learning you'll learn how to better prompt the AI to get the best result as possible and you will see that one thing that really helps is having a code base like a template like a Cod template that you reuse across your apps so that uh the AI has a already like a foundation so it can add more code on top of it that is similar to your foundation for instance this is a little code base I built for myself about a year and a half ago for because I was U making the same project over and over as the starting point and now I always have like this code base and whenever I start a new project the AI already has some data some file some codee to look at so you can just write the code that is right for me so there are a few things you want to consider to get the best results first you want to have the right naming so you want to have like explicit names for your variables files and functions so for instance my API endpoints have a clear naming for instance the Chrome folder this check status or this fetch email for uh payments uh this is explicit so me as a developer I understand what it means and the AI can Al also understand what it means in in the same way uh if I search for button in my files all the react component I create that have a button will include the word button inside of the file so if I search for button I will find all the buttons I use in my app and the words after explain a little bit about what this button does so button checkout will uh create a checkout the button name is also button checkout so this gives more uh context to the AI it's easier for the AI if I want to create a new feature that creates a checkout the AI knows right away there is another very powerful feature you can use at the beginning when you're getting started is AI rules uh those are a set of rules that we give to the AI developers in order for the AI to behave the way we want so in cursor you can go to cursor settings and then cursor settings and here you have this like a big text file where you can input uh anything you want those are basically rules that will be used by the AI to generate code that fits your needs so in my case uh I explain my text tack I'm using JavaScript react node etc etc so uh whenever I try new features for instance I want the AI to keep um suggesting tools and text tacks that I use myself also if you have some preference about how you use the libraries sometimes there are Frameworks like nextjs that um builds features so fast that you want your AI to use the latest ones or the ones you use for all of your project uh this is where you can mention all of that right here as of 2025 uh there is the 8020 rule uh that I use where 80% of the code is return by an AI and 20% of the code is return by me so usually what I do is one of I have something to build the AI builds it first it does the hard work of creating the components writing the functions Etc I keep promting the AI until I refine and get a result that are pretty decent then I apply all my changes and then me as a developer I finish the last 20% by reviewing the code and polishing a few details on it until it works as I expect okay and finally this is pretty new uh but this is absolutely awesome especially for us developers who are not the best at designing uh is how to use AI inside of your code Editor to design for you so sometimes I don't know exactly how the design should look like so what I do is I find a design that I like I just search for like the components I'm trying to design inside of Google I'll pick an image that I like pretty much so for a Time picker let's say I would go for this one for instance I would just take a screenshot of it and I would give the screenshot to the composer so right here you have an option that says image and you can upload a photo of the component you want and I would add a little uh explainer of what I want you can say uh you know change the colors and make it as a primary orange or something U build this component name it whatever you want and what should happen when the person click on buttons Etc and then you submit and the a will give you something that usually is working pretty well so learn how to become lazy and uh take parts that you like and just use the AI to code for you okay I just added this little section here because I think it's important uh these days I see lots of developers mentioning tools like vzer and lovable as the perfect place to start your product project and I don't think so so in case you know you don't know what those are uh those are basically like web apps where you can input whatever you want create a dashboard create a signup page a landing page for my app or whatever and it's going to uh generate the entire code in front of you and it builds some really absolutely beautiful components like those crypto dashboards nice customer facing dashboards landing pages Etc the output you get from just a little input of text is absolutely amazing but it is also dangerous because it is not trained on your code it is trained on the overall internet it is going to Output some code that you are not familiar with it might use different libraries that the one you're using it will have different design constraints than the word the one you're using it will name your files Etc differently than the one you typically do and in the end you're going to have to do a lot of rework in order to um format this code to fit into your own project so what I recommend you is to not use those tools even though I love them is to uh build something by yourself in your code editor and then whenever you create a new project reuse your code as a foundation as a code base for your next project and then you can use the AI inside of your code editor in order to uh write code for you design components for you uh you can upload those components for instance and you can tell the AI to uh fit the design constraints you set up and so it's going to create the same uh time Pier which will have the same uh border radius as your other components will have the same color at your other components it will name the file exactly like the way you name your other files and you will have really few work to do on the AI outputs and it's going to make your life much easier and this is likely the end of the road map now let me give you two quick piece of advice before I let you build your apps the first one is that I have seen hundreds of people making money on the internet and they all have one thing in common they all have a bias for Action they show up every single day and build stuff watching a video to learn how to code is great but now taking your computer and starting to code your own project is even better and second advice do marketing at some points building app is really fun but you will need some users to impact people's life to make a little bit of money So eventually you can quit your job and for that you need to do marketing 50% coding 50% marketing is a good balance I know marketing is hard especially when you're a developer that's why I'm going to link below some articles that I wrote that uh I like marketing strategies that I've learned along the journey that help me uh get couple thousands of visitors on my site every single day it goes from SEO ads copyrighting audience building Etc check out the description below it is free and that's it that's I think it's about a 2 or three hours long video so congrats for staying until the end and also congrats to myself for finishing this video because it took me a lot of time you probably have seen from my beard and my hair uh that went a little crazy that it took about a month or something also remember that there are no sponsors for this video none of the tools I recommended pay me to make this video because I have made a course called code fast to help people learn how to code from scratch like what we've done in the road map but more in the details into each steps over 2,000 students love the course so if you like this video you might like the course as well now I want you to close this video take your keyboard start typing some JavaScript buy a domain name push it on the internet and add a link below this video as proof of work see you next time

okay so this weekend project made a million dollar after 18 months just build whatever you have in mind we're going to leave Val and we're going to travel all over the world it's time to work boom a freaking million dollars get the weekend project this is a website build something build it fast code code code and then repeat over and over and over this is the freaking [Music] date meet Mark Lou a millionaire who owns exactly zero pairs of shoes and way more startups than you'd think is reasonable he sits here in this disgustingly beautiful Tropical Paradise to show you how to turn ideas into Brands strangers into clients and your boring job into a distant memory good morning good morning in doing the food we uh that would be a good thumbnail just came back to Bali full jet lag but it's time to work Houston we have a big problem Brian Johnson just released a new video about calculating your speed of Aging for free so the video looks looks like this and there are six markers that you can do at home for free like how many push-up reps can you do um and and some of many other stuff and of course that gives me tons of app ideas so what I did is I Clon my Bott plates and I ask my AI editor a cursor to build an entire app for me I didn't write a single line of code and this is what I came up with so that's uh this is this is pretty made with AI and those basically more like forms where you enter number push-ups one leg stand U and few of other metrics and then you can calculate your score and in the end it will give you a result on what's your biological age this is extremely lowlevel product for the moment I have tons of ideas like adding leaderboards uh making it verified with uh actually uploading photos connecting your Twitter Google accounts so it could be like a leaderboard with profile pictures for uh like real people I also bought a new domain name bio a.ge for Bio AG this this is a really early stage but there's something going on with health at the moment artificial intelligence is shaping the medical industry and if you are a maker it's a big wave to jump in because things are going to happen in many ways stepping into Healthcare right now is like stepping into that future world the next 10 years are going to be crazy with a mix of AI an AI tool they trained on medical data plus the health wave there tons of things to build and I really really really really recommend you to just jump in just build whatever you have in mind don't spend too much time on it just ship your idea out there I hope the app is ready when this video comes out if that's the case there will be a link in the description and my goal is to get Brian Johnson to see this app and retweet it let's go all right so something I I believe too is that if you want something to work out on the internet you get to put on the energy you have to leave through it in my case I'm really into mental health and physical health and I'm going to build tons of health related startups but at the same time I try to have a life that is perfectly healthy so that means better food better sleep more workouts that means I learn things that means I discover problems and that feeds my inspiration to build startups and because those startup ideas are based on real fact the life I live then I am almost guaranteed that at some point some of those startup will also appeal to some other people time for workout and if you don't know what is your thing then try new stuff travel abroad meet some new group of people like go to meetups where people have different skills than yours try something new get out of the comfort zone now time to C I just got this from Google it's a badge that says I got 10,000 visitors on one of my websites in the past 30 days this website actually was my first ever indie project and even though it's not sexy it's like a Bas simple movie recommendation app this project gave me this batch from Google but it also grew my follow on Twitter gave me tons of new startup ideas and it gave me the confidence I needed to get started so do more not sexy project any kind of project just shap something and maybe years down the road you'll get a website with 300 daily visitors and you can run ads and he could pay for your rent I'm reading the inevitable inevitable by Kevin KY the guy who created the magazine wired and also the author of a book one of my actually top three favorite books ever called excellent advice of wisdom I wish I knew earlier or something along those lines the book itself is is just a masterpiece it's a collection basically of like mini tweets that each of them is a life lesson and uh this one the inevitable is about predictions that he makes about where Tech and AI will drive the world like 12 prediction on how the world is going to change I'm 36% completed with this book and I already love it full rainy season in b meanwhile delicious meal prepar by it's 7:30 a.m. and I just bought another domain two days two domain names now that I am back in my office in Bali I'm super super happy to add this into my room office whatever this is because it's here in this room that this was made possible and actually same as this little thing here is because at some point I decided to sit in this room and just spend most of my time building stuff that those two things happen so keep shipping I just set up these recovery emails so this is being sent to people who actually uh complete a part of the checkout they leave their email address but they don't complete the payment could be because the credit card failed it could be because they changed their mind at the last minute so what I'm doing here in the stripe webbook event called checkout. session. expired I'm checking if the person left an email otherwise I can't email them and if the person is not already a customer of mine and if that's the case then I send them a very simple email that says hey I noticed you were checking out cut fast yesterday anything I can help you with and then a link to get back to my landing page just in case they forgot or in case something go wrong here what I'm doing with this is I'm opening the discussion so I'm trying to understand why they didn't purchase even though they click the button and left their emails and I just hope this will give me some uh better uh feedback so I know maybe how to tweak the landing page to convert more visitors and if you want the code there is a link to one of my tweets below this video where you can just copy past the code and use it in your own project okay so I just set up YouTube ads for my course code fast I am very bad at ads really really bad but I want to give it a try because we never know uh sometimes you try stuff and it works and sometimes it doesn't but uh just curious about this one still waiting for Google to approve the ad and um let's see how it goes okay so quick update on Coach fast the course I launched about a month and a half ago uh you can see the revenue uh of course at the launch was going up like crazy and then now it's slowing down and what I'm trying to do uh for this first quarter of the year is to try to find a recurring marketing channel and since it's a course is pretty large I'm targeting like a very wide audience so I'm trying to run ads to this website so I created this sort of uh as here so you want to learn a code to build your own online business go to cast.now enroll for the course learn the basics and everything you need to build an online business ready to get customers so my video editor pH a model in Bell to help me read the script and since I absolutely suck at making a marketing scripts I asked my friend Nico who is really good at marketing to help me with that and then for the format I got inspired by clo which is a very famous software engineer on you YouTube I remember 3 four years ago I was watching a bunch of his videos then I saw a masterpiece of an ad and I use his format to make my own ad and I just started running this uh YouTube video on Google ads so it's only showing on YouTube at the moment I just started spending money so I have two campaigns one uh that is a wide campaign so it targets people who are somehow in the software engineer coding industry so people who visit websites like code academy or who watch a YouTube like a programming YouTube YouTu channels it looks like it's getting a bunch of clicks for the amount spent about $30 per day uh but so far no conversion so I don't know if I'm doing something wrong with my code or if it's just not converging at the moment and I set up another campaign where it's more like retargeting people who visited the websites uh usually this is what marketer calls that like a warm audience so people who are more likely to buy your product because they already know what you have to sell and uh Google is going to show this ad to those people where it gets way less click but somehow it converted already uh I think there was one purchase which makes the campaign profitable making ads is really not my uh cup of tea but I feel like if I manage to make it click it could be one way to make sure that the business somehow is steady and then I can focus on for instance um making more lessons adding more things for students so my time and mind doesn't have to be on the marketing side of things and of course if I get good results I'll report that in those videos I can't not put this on the record this should be remembered 15 ingredients vegetables and love that's the recipe important is there wave sir yeah tomorrow is going to be firing W hello little babies hello hello this is uh the place here where we came with tons of ideas for the Vlogs tons of startup ideas walking man it's a such a creativity hack that's true okay so we are deciding where we go this year because we're going to leave Bal and we're going to travel all over the world to meet you we're going to host a Meetup we're going to host Meetup countri first is New Zealand then we're going to go to Japan Japan oh we're going to do a meet up in B first then the plan is right now we go India first then we go back to Europe we were thinking of doing like Norway Finland Sweden North countries just for the peacefulness and quietness and then maybe the US go we know that there are many people living in the North America like Canada us so we're excited to meet you there as well that's very true and if you can maybe St or Central America because it has been my you know dream to go back there and we go back to France for next Christmas the issue here is trying to stay productive while traveling so I still make apps we still make those Vlogs we still make more videos on YouTube right for the news later make some tweets while trying to enjoy traveling this is the really hard part but uh yeah let's see it now it's put on the camera we'll see how that year goes it's so empty there is no one here except this person good wave tomorrow yeah this is where I'm surfing yeah I'm excited I cannot wait for tomorrow wow look at this man such a de Focus mode we're working on I I am designing this was one of the most requested feature so now you can watch your website analytics for specific like a custom date range so you have this option where you can choose to watch for custom and then you have this date biger yeah that's pretty much it so I'm pushing this today I guess I spend too much time on this but I freaking love it I like all the little animations where the mouse cursor moves and even this you know like this little transition when you move the cursor and then it's just super exciting actually to make this kind of stuff I didn't really like at the beginning then you realize design is absolutely not about creativity but more like principles it's a mix of rules and coping what's working adding your own signature on top of it and then a little bit of obsession no coffee and straight wake up code code code ah quick update on my web analytics software data fast so let's look first at the revenue on stripe now I start to see daily payments which make me super happy like little uh sales notifications uh here we're looking at the last what 3 weeks or so of data uh so we can see the monthly recuring revenue is at 925 which is getting close to $11,000 per month that makes me super happy it's overall going up constantly and the number of active subscribers as well and the subscriber turn rate is now around 14% I guess which is uh I I think I can leave up with it I added new feature this uh option here will let users choose uh when they want to query their data and I also spend a little too much time designing this uh loading screen where uh when people change the type of Journey they want to see they want to know what their customers are doing on their sites they're going to see like a little spinner like a loading screen here so they have something to look at and they know it's loading this is not necessarily useful but this just made me so happy I also created a documentation for data fast to help people set up their accounts so this is kind of like a Blog SL documentation this is using a mark down down template right here where I just have to write English and a couple of markdowns and it outputs a nice looking documentation and of course I had to design every little uh things from scratch but now that it's designed I don't do anything I just make beautiful articles uh very simply oh and one last thing I am not sure I mentioned this in the this YouTube video I set up server side tracking which means that now people using data fast and tracking payments with it can link visitors and customers data with almost 100% accuracy so that they know exactly where the money is coming from the goal with this software is to grade to a million dollar in valuation so that's about 20 to $225,000 in monthly recuring Revenue we're far from there and there are still a lot of things to build but uh it's going up so this is a positive thing are you ready for the cold PL no more Russian what is this head actually I really don't know I hope our Russian friends can tell us what is this okay please leave in the comment what is this for yes look at this wow with all this view very good yeah so let's take some SAA and think about our life Wow super hot man so H the the iPhone will die the warmest sa I've ever is it cool so I think you can stay unlimited here until we I need a massive [Applause] coconut I found a flower W influencers daily reminder for happiness it's time to work what is it what do you see um 800k we have cross $1 million with ship Fest already wow how many months 18 18 months this this is the freaking date we made it what's very crazy to me is we were sitting in the exact place 18 months ago we made almost 0 back then yeah and I remember I had this little weekend project that I created for myself and I was like ah I'm going to try to launch it and right here it was 5:00 p.m. I was about to go skate before it's dark and I put the computer and I told you I launched something on product hunt I'll be back in 2 hours we're lucky if we make $300 I had no idea any of this would happen oh yeah cuz back then we didn't have any result so if you can have like one or three sale it was still success you know and then one year and a half later boom a freaking million dollar with a weekend project this is a website the launch day was crazy CU we earn like $4,000 a day yeah about three 3.5 but still like for us like $1,000 was a monthly salary and then yeah we kept having notification and we were in Hong Kong we kept up what is happening is it real like yeah it's was like did you make money we refresh like wow we just drank coffee more Starbucks Cooke wow we made more money in 24 hours than we would in 6 month crazy okay so this weekend project made a million dollar after 18 months and 85% of that is pure profit these are the stripe dashboard so that's the first one back in 2023 and I then I opened a new business and this is the new one so I wanted to tell you a little story about finding million-dollar startup ideas I started the entrepreneurship in 20 2016 back then I had a Grand Vision like a big dream I was working 12 hours a day and I believe that IDs were Priceless and 4 years later I made around $70,000 with one of my set which let me pay the bills which is technically not bad I was able to leave anywhere with a computer but with all the sacrifices I made it was clearly not worth it and that's why I had a burnout in 2020 and this is the actual SAS I created I was working with physical businesses Escape rooms and in then in 2020 Co killed my set it went literally from about $4,000 in monthly recurring Revenue to zero in a single month and after that I had almost no savings no ideas to start next and not even motivation to start again so I started to look for a job and I work as a software engineer for someone that you might know tylerz and they offered me a salary that was way beyond what I ever thought I would earn so obviously I accepted and I worked for them for 9 months but of course there was this it ins inside of me this Freedom itch that keeps scratching back and called me back and so in November 2021 I started entrepreneurship again and this time I had a different set of rules I dit all the ambitious and the Big Dreams that I had before and instead I would work on tiny little project that I could launch on a weekend I would share everything publicly on Twitter and then I would just launch move build while making sleep my number one priority and back then my goal was to create something that I can control and the goal was to create a massive portfolio of websites sometimes those websites are not even monetized like this one here where you can vote for your favorite quote from Naval ravikant about this websit where you can like visualize how much you can achieve in one year with tiny habits I build this directory of gamification apps there was no goal really it was just purely I want to build this portfolio of websites and 12 months later I had made around $10,000 and grow a little audience of 5,000 people on Twitter which is definitely good but clearly knowing that I was working all day and then I was already in the game for 5 years this is also not crazy but it doesn't matter because I was actually having tons of fun and since my obsession was to build a portfolio massive portfolio a website I wanted to create a little tool for myself so that I can make those websites faster so I created this tool called ship fast and launched it on the last day of August 2023 2 days later it made $6,000 what I would typically earn in 6 months and now day 18 months later it made a million dollar this is just absolutely crazy because in my journey it was just yet another website with uh no marketing strategies no big plans nothing just a little tool I need for myself but this experience took me one thing that is crucial startup ideas are not found they are crafted from your own experience so instead of waiting for uh something a good idea to come and strike you instead here is what you can do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around and find out build something build it fast share it to the world whether it's on Twitter Youtube or Instagram repeat the same process but this time build something different or share it in a different way and then repeat over and over and over and then in all the noise you create when it's time some luck something some signal will find you so if you're a developer like me who loves to create stuff this is your advantage ship stuff no matter the outcome no matter if you get lots of users no matter if it makes some money just ship it for the sake of it ship it to create the noise so that luck can find you later keep shipping I want to confess something I bought a new domain name damn it

TITLE: I got KICKED OUT for hosting an ILLEGAL meetup with 100 developers!
VIDEO ID: QLE5SGu0ID4
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLE5SGu0ID4
================================================================================

in my case the key for this was to try to live an unusual life Wow 2024 everything compounded this is so crazy I'm I'm extremely nervous [Music] mental and don't forget to put this freaking pay and I hope you had a good time Mark time to open the YouTube Silver we've been waiting for so long open it okay okay this so beautiful it's weird to receive package from YouTube we started YouTube like January this year than all right oh wow YouTube made a welcome letter what do it say do you remember your first subscriber your 100th or your thousands keep creating keep building oh wow they it feels like the YouTube see sent me a liter so keep creating keep building we can't wait to see what you'll do next and we're here to support you along the way and who knows when you reach your millionth subscriber you may just write to you and ask do you remember your 100,000 subscriber wow that is it the silver it's super legit wait that's beautiful presented to Maru for passing 100,000 subscribers yeah so how how do you feel I grew up with YouTube like my University my teacher everything is YouTube from copyrighting marketing just even coding like most of my coding skills come from YouTube like this has been a long for a while like I would watch Youtubers with this stuff in the background and you know you kind of Imagine like wow that must be such a cool life to have this in your background this guy must be crushing it and just seeing it in real like it's I'm one of them now that's is so crazy I'm just I don't know I'm also okay it's time bragging time but I'm also very proud of me of course you've been showing up every day i' been making a YouTube video once a week even though you work full time on your app yeah this man Honestly YouTube is one of the least unexpected events that happened this year because the entire Journey started from like close to zero followers in January and pass 100K 2 months ago or something less than 10 months from Z to 100K and knowing that this is not my full-time job like this is a habit every Saturday I would make a video and only on Saturday I would wake up in the morning I have to find an idea an interesting angle a thumbnail an intro and shoot the entire video and be done by the end of the day and I stick to that habit since January this year and this happened I didn't quit I didn't quit at the beginning nothing was happening to month month was nothing like I made 10 videos it was nothing any tips to make a video like that you like to make but also people like to watch that's an interesting one I think the I think I'm um I'm not the typical YouTuber because I'm not a content creator I I just try to leave A Life That's unusual and make content out of it so my life is the story I don't create a story my life is the story and we tried to package it in a YouTube videos that hopefully feels like a better story but the key I think the key for this in my case the key for this was to try to live an unusual life and for that that means building stuff that people normally don't build um I don't know like doing Health routine that people normally don't follow this is what is behind this YouTube button yeah try to leave something that fills you and that not everybody is living try to make something different and try to stick to it long enough so that becomes your identity and people will identify you as the guy who does this can you show me one more time squ then press if I drop him we get Legacy earlier foreign speee spee I'm on the train to go to the south of friends from Paris to visit some relatives so I'm taking some time to break down things that happened recently so okay first for the launch of data fast it's been now 30 days exactly and it made 300,000 in Revenue which is absolutely mind- glowing it's by far the best product I've ever built and now that some students start to finish the course they start to get results and build their own websites and some even get users and customers that really makes me so happy I am also breaking down everything I achieved in 2024 and as a comparison this is my salary since I got fired from my software engineer job so literally nothing happened for the first 2 years I was just barely surviving then something took off in 2023 and in 2024 everything compounded I had no idea I would create a baller plate I had no idea I would make a course I actually had no idea what would happen I just knew that if I stick to something maybe eventually something will happen and let me um um be financially independent so I've just planted a bunch of seed like from the moment I got fired I I I made all those like 25 plus websites and then eventually at some point some of those website took off and created a little story and compound it if we take a software like Indie page for instance which is a little Link in BIO tool um it started earlier back in 2022 he was he was making roughly like couple hundred a month and just because I posted on the internet people gave me feedback they wanted to see some features and I just listened to my users and I started to implement those features one of them they wanted to see is an SEO backlink and the revenue kept growing because of that feature it's a matter of consistency showing up it's a matter of not giving up and listening to users and staying in the game long enough until it happens to you there's a quote that says we overestimate what we can achieve in one day but we underestimate what we can achieve in one year and this could summarize exactly my journey I never believe I would be able to build so many startups but I've have been showing up every single day and eventually something happened if you believe in yourself and show up consistently this can be your journey too you can do it V I recently was asked which feature should I prioritize for my software and usually I put them into two buckets the product features and the growth features and I split my time 50% for each bucket for instance for this little uh piece of software that I built and for all of the product features I have one goal in mind is to reduce the churn I just go to my stripe dashboard and I look at the subscriber turn rate and my goal is to make it go as low as possible and when you mix reducing turn and building features you end up building features your users want and for that I have built in my software again a little um feedback board page where my users can submit whatever they want to see in the product they can also up vote what other people post and so as a business owner I know exactly what my users want then I just list all of them by priority and I build them into the product for instance the one I working on right now is to let people search their uh analytics for a custom date wrench the goal with the product features bucket is to make people love the product so much that they don't want to churn and then there's is the other bucket which I call the growth features bucket it's features that users normally don't request it's more like my creative brain wants to add something uh because I think it might be valuable for my users one of them for instance which I shipped recently is uh in the email report use my users get from data fast at the bottom there is a growth Insight which is like an AI that is trained on the data from my customers to help them understand some patterns and how to make more money from some specific marketing channels this is not something I can ask my users because this is something I can only guess from my mind and the goal with this kind of bucket is to try a new vertical for my product to try to um find something that makes the product so good because it has this specific feature that my users will want to spread the word about it that I can update the lending page copy and say that this product can also do that which is amazing um it has some sort of like a grow business growth or virality embedded into it and I just split my time 50% improving the actual product and 50% adding new features and this is how somehow on data fast I'm able to increase the number of active subscribers without losing much of them and I'm not 100% sure where this is going to go but that's the blueprint I trust to grow this software to a million doll in valuation finally this Sunday we're going to have some first meet up in Paris oh yes no this is this is two days right yes this is totally mad look 500 likes okay BR this is so crazy we just thought it would be nice to meet people behind the camera who are into like making apps and building little startups on the internet and I make a random tweet with a form for to submit just you know if you want to meet us like we open meet up actually I feel it's a very unplanned un nothing we don't have a script we don't have a place it's like open Meetup in the middle of Paris and I just posted that the Tweet got 500 likes which is a lot and then the four 130 people wow 13 people coming in the Jan l yeah we thought like just 10 to 20 people sign up then it would be amazing because we posted very in the last minute and it's out it's like 3° outside it might be raining it's outdoor there's no splend or whatever 130 people actually we we might do it again in Bali and New Zealand very soon and I think if we both like it we can create like a even schedule of places where you're going to go even we're going to organize and I still don't know exactly how to structure the event but at least we can you know organize them in advance people can register and eventually we get to meet someone across the world yeah why you're concerning no serly this is going to be a mess we are 200 participants for the Meetup are going to manage everyone I I rely on you you're the one me yes I am I'm developer you know like uh you know I you the social person here how can I speak to 200 people in open space I think we we really I think we clearly underestimate how big 200 people is and let's say only 50% of them come that's 100 people and Mark is super nervous it's his first time like a speaking from dness I'm I'm extremely nervous I'm extremely nervous well you got this it's going to be fine people love you and people all want hear the story I hope it's valuable for people who are coming I really hope so y see you there we can I think we will make like two to three minutesand I'm not radio programmer I have take the Cod fast course of Mark maybe one month ago this is why I was really jealous of you guys because uh you can just take your ideas and bringing to life computers and I cannot so that's why I take the course of Mark it was really help so maybe some testimonials life testimonials so because uh programming it's uh really complicated for people who don't have the code uh it's a really hard to understand the the full picture and the course really help me because uh it takes everything maybe on the surface and uh and help me have the big picture understand what is really uh building a product8 years8 years oh okay 8 years have problem uh the lesson is even if the app is a very very simple app you don't know what user is actually going to Value so just ship it sh uh it was inspired a lot by this community so thanks everybody who is doing this crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh it's um yeah it's a huge motivation thank you everything and don't forget to put this freaking payable I'm poine and I started to create SAS I think three years ago uh with many failures I created websites Etc but uh each time I started a project I just abandoned just start if you have an 0 so and uh by the way it's to uh stick with it uh share your journey because when you are sharing people are here to help you to give you advice if you do everything in the shadow nobody will know and of course you're ID will remain secret but uh if you don't want your ID to be secret if you want to earn money with it so just uh ship it don't overthink and uh talk a lot about your project because everybody can help how do you find a good idea okay so I think yes I tried many different topics like I tried to create a fun Instagram account I tried crypto I tried b2c and I think product that was failure wasn't a failure at the end because it teached me a lot when you think your idea is good when you have idea how to Market it try to do things but if it doesn't bring any traction just for at a certain moment just drops the idea I think we just had a meet up I just talked to Fabian and Carlos and they all say I mean not all but some people say they came they took a flight to come to this meet up that's crazy yeah it was it was just a tweet in my head it was just a tweet and people really loved it it's like everybody thanks for thank you so much for coming it was absolutely amazing and we got this gift one gift is actually one I think it's a book one is actually for you oh really yeah oh so kind oh what book is it it's ads from like a old collection of ads oh that's love Yeah Bo love your creativity this is such a nice gift oh Mar want to say oh I think this one maybe oh it's in French what Walt oh Walt Disney autobiography I think no I think he sketches and maybe the his story maybe well everybody we met today all had the desire to build their own abs and you know have this entrepreneurship freedom and I think about half of them is making money on the internet already already wow that was really impressive how many people came today I think we were we were 100 we have yeah we have to show like right now boom footage of the group photo yeah mental so how did you feel meeting all those people you know real life we'll do it again we'll do you again yeah yeah I'll be more prepared I guess it feels good I think it feels good for everyone most of most of people the thing the number one thing they mentioned is please create a group and do it again m M I think I think there is there's something I think there's you know this it's you you feel lonely somehow in the journey I do feel lonely in and I think people were happy to connect with others mhm so yeah we we'll do it again yeah look at where we're going to the mission Star restaurant in Paris I'm really happy we can give the nice lunch experience to our family as Christmas gift go back to Bali it's time to Surf oh okay we are in Paris airport we are going back to Bali we're late uh this is one day after the event it was crazy over 100 people of you came and it was just insane I got to meet some of you um I got to meet this crazy guy you must want to check the story in the description I made a tweet about him he made over 3 million in 2024 and he did zero marketing this is pure inspiration and since you guys love the Meetup so much we are going to do it again the next one will be in Bell then New Zealand then likely Japan and I will keep you posted on when those Meetup happens using Discord so there is a link below this video where you can join a public Discord where you and other people who are into entrepreneurship can just come and join you can hang out with people who've been to previous meetups you can organize your own meetups and this is where I'm going to keep you

================================================================================

[Music] oh man workout always feel like a burden before I start but it feels so good when I'm done okay so some people asked how do I get feet but the truth is I am lazy I've never been to a gym and I don't have time I have nine tiny businesses to run and so I build a little system for myself that requires the minimum input for the maximum output so here are the eight Fitness rules that transfer my body and uh my workout routine is at the end so rule number one I always g a really good night of sleep there is a part of the brain that is responsible for uh self discipline and decision making and that part regenerate during the night I think it's called the preal cortex like some Andrew ubberman thing but I can tell that if I have 6 hours of sleep I'm going to wake up and everything will feel hard I know I have to work out but I'll struggle to find the motivation and it's going to be so easy for me to just ditch that workout session but on the other side if I sleep 8 hours my motivation my self- will power is much stronger and then I never dit the workout and of course there is this like deep sleep thing where you have all the muscle recovering happening during the night so always try to get 8 hours of sleep this is super important a good place to get started is to always go to bed at the same time my bedtime is 9:00 p.m. and I never uh change that try to sleep in a room that is a little bit cold have a little wind down routine where you don't look at your phone or you don't think about work before going to bed and avoid having heavy meals before going to bed now the rule number two is to always work out in the morning the reason is because there is like the dopamine system that makes us do things in order to get the reward but now with like social media and and uh sugary food and stuff like that we can easily get dopamine for like the really minimal amount of effort and so that workout feels like it's really hard it's a really hard thing to do but the good thing is that when you work out in the morning your brain is like pure because during the night the the brain restores the dopamine level to like a Bas line it's much easier to find motivation early in the morning and whenever I tell myself I'm going to work out someone in the evening because I don't have time right now I always end up not doing it rule number three is to work out every single day I know it seems hard but the truth is you don't need to go to the gym and spend 2 hours what you want to do is you want to start extremely small you can start with 10 push-ups per day you want to do it every single day early in the morning until you start building an identity of a person who works out every single day there's a really good book about that which is atomic habits and this is how you forge a new personality and now because I build this like habit of working out every day it is impossible for me to not work out I wouldn't say I like workout but I am addicted like this is my new personality and if I don't work out I feel bad which then pushes me to do the workout no matter what and so what I started doing is at first I made the workout very small like super tiny so I couldn't say no because it was like 10 minutes and then I started to add a little bit more workout every day when it became too easy more push-up more chin up more ABS Etc rule number four is to know exactly what you want to get I don't care having a bulky physic I don't care having massive biceps I'm not Alex hormozi this is something I do not care about I know exactly what I want I want to be lean I want to be fit I want to be able to jump I want to be super flexible stretchy this is exactly what I want and that is much easier than having a massive body with massive muscles I have picked a goal that I can achieve relatively easily so that I so that I am always satisfied now the mistake number five is that to push extra hard and I see lots of people making that mistake for me I work out a very minimal amount of time 30 to 40 minutes per day but when I am in these workouts I become a beast like there's nothing else that matters outside there's no f there is no distraction I am 100% into the workout and what I try to do is I always try to have an extra rep I try to beat the teacher that's my new game I try to go faster than them like I am 100% committed into the workout so that in the minimum amount of time I invest for that workout I'll get the maximum output rule number six is to find a workout that feels like a play to you I have been struggling with motivation my whole life it started with school because my teachers were boring then I struggled to find pleasure in the in the workouts still but the cure to that is to play and workout is not my playground surfing is so whenever I can I live in Bal I will go for a surf session and dit the workouts because I do something that I like it is so easy to find the motivation to get started it is so easy to push that extra rep because it feels like a play try to find something you like that could be running that could be climbing there many other activities that you can do rather than just doing workout at home rule number seven is to move more of I used to think that um walking and things like low intensity workouts that doesn't make me sweat are useless I studed to understand kind of understand how the body works like how the food is processed and how it's used to consume energy and just simply walking consumes lot of energy it will basically drain the glucose out of the blood use it as energy and then it will consume the fat in order to find more energy and so just walking will make you leaner they say that everywhere that 10,000 step per day is making you healthy I refuse to believe it for so long and now I Chang my mind so every time after a meal I'll will go on the trend meal at home and I would spend 10 to 15 minutes walking fast making at least 1 kilometer so that I Cross My 10K steps because the problem with my work is that I am working on my computer most of the day and uh actually maybe I should make more YouTube videos because at least I get to stand a little bit rule number eight and the final one is eating the right food it's crazy how much it impacts the body shape the first one the most obvious one is that when you eat protein you grow muscles so for that I eat P protein uh in addition to what I eat on a daily basis to make sure I have enough protein and I try to eat at least 1.5 time my weight in protein so I have around 120 gam of protein per day and the second most important effect on the body is that it burns fat uh I'm not a scientist or a doctor uh but roughly what I understand is that first the body when it needs energy it will use the glucose and then it will burn the fat out of the body so technically if you don't overeat you should lower your body fat what I eat on a daily basis could be an entire video but it's roughly this I eat mostly vegetables like I eat tons of vegetables recently I tried an experiment where I cut down completely carbage Foods so bread pizza pasta grains and stuff like that and that had a dramatic impact on my Cravings I used to be hungry all the time across the day and since I remove that and now I eat really really low carbs I don't have cravings anymore I'm not even hungry I eat two meals per day and I just feel lighter not wanting to eat and of course that impacts my body and I'm lovering my body fat and on top of that I don't eat any sugar whatsoever and I don't drink alcohol I eat a few supplements so I have this like collagen peptide this is not a sponsored video by the way this is just literally my collagen peptide I I eat around 10 gr per day I think I feel like it feels good for the ligaments I have way less pain than I used to I actually I don't have any pain anymore um this really changed my life the supplements from Brian Johnson the blueprint stack as I said I also eat a little extra protein from like protein PE protein powder and creatine around five four to five gr per day which same could be an entire video by itself uh also change my life make my brain feel like better sharper and feels like the Muscle Recovery is way faster okay now this is my workout routine I have a base that is around 10 minutes that I do every single day no matter what that includes 20 uh pullup and chinups each 28 80 push-ups I do 40 push-up in a weird position and 40 push-ups in another weird position I always try to rotate what kind of uh push-ups I do I do 125 Russian situps and if possible I will use a dumbbell like a 10 kilo dumbbell on top of that and I finish with a 5 minute plank I put on a music that is around 5 minutes and I try to hold as much as I can the numbers are weird like 20 25 85 whatever is because as I said before I am building tiny habits and whenever I reach level where I'm comfortable I try to add an extra rep an extra rep an extra rep until I get comfortable and of course when I started it was much lower than that I couldn't even do five pull-up chin-up and on top of that I have two Alternatives if the waves are good in B I'll will go surf right away but if the waves are crap like they are at the moment and for the past two weeks I would just do a workout at home there are two types of workout I do mostly it's either calisthenic 30 to 40 minutes of like pure body weight slow movements uh very hard on the muscle but slow movements or I'm going to do interval high-intensity interval training for like 30 minutes while push the cardio to the next level and I tried to rotate a calisthenic a hit a calisthenic and a hit and just recently my wife bought some dumbbells and I started like dumbbell workouts like 10 kgam workout I found all my routines on YouTube I watch Caroline g a famous YouTuber's videos and I just follow along and I try to beat her and final part I don't think this one really impact my body shape but it makes me feel good uh I do 15 minutes of stretching for going to bed there is a huge part on Fitness which is about genetics we all have different metabolisms um so those are my results but my wife started to follow the same routine actually I followed my wife routine more than that she's Asian and she's a female so completely different genetics and the results she's had are crazy I'm super proud of her when we met 7 years ago we both had neglected Fitness for a little while and in the past year or so we've taken Health to the next level and the results she's had are absolutely crazy when I look at her back she look like she has like those almost you could climb on top of it um all because we are following these like rules that uh I just mentioned in the video and then I think I made this entire video in one shot right after workout I didn't eat any single food this morning and it's almost 11:00 a.m. so now it's time for the breakfast and the protein shake do that workout today

TITLE: I MADE $100,000 IN 2 DAYS 🤯🤯🤯
VIDEO ID: TXla9Zq3Iqc

================================================================================

we launched 36 hours ago $68,000 relx what took you so long just sh a new feature should I [Music] click blue pill or the red pill I just shipped a new feature on ship fast it's called Perks it's basically a list of discounts for popular products I'm so happy cuz I was able to work with versal which is one of the most common hosting platform out there as well as some really cool other products I'm about to add another one called recent to send emails and the entire bundle is worth over $1,000 in discount I'm carefully handpicking product that either help people save money or make more money cuz my goal is to help a th000 makers make $1,000 online and also now at the same time on my landing page I can say things like this where I can show how much worth of discounts people can expect to get and that makes the price of the ball plates looks cheap compared to that so I hope that will improve a little bit the conversion rate okay so we are two days before black Friday everything was planned and scheduled and I do the last checkup with my friends I always do that whenever I launch a new startups I always send it to a couple of my friends ask what they think about it because when I build a learning page I'm always in my head and sometimes I don't see things and it would be a terrible mistake if I just ship the startups as it is so I ask a few people around me what they think about it and this is not good ah I was really convinced that the landing page was great like good enough to launch and all my friends from different background told me it is not good at all like really I got really poor feedback uh the problem is I have 2 days left I I just don't I I I don't even know what I will have time to do build it launch it wow you're man my heart just m be like crazy all right I want to see where surf brings the cardio level I don't think I get this exhausted when I surf what's the next so we made the cardio heat goes up next is a little bit of muscle strengths I do planks then I usually do at pull-ups push-ups push-ups and 40 pull-up chein up for 20 pull-up 20 whatever and uh that's it it's either cardio at home or surf which also does the cardio and build muscles but then I don't really leave we apart really sometimes so I try to have always like those CH up P up push-up Etc so I do a little bit of strength as well not just cardio since I didn't do any ABS I'm going to do a little bit this it's I'm going to say something very controversial but I think my strength is my laziness because I know I would never be able to go to the gym I know I would never have the courage to go to the gym and do the communting and spending two hours and thinking about the gym because I'm lazy and I don't want to do that I try to find my own constraints and rules in my laziness bubble interesting because people need to investment to feel more motivated they need that membership to show up if is a home they be EAS it to compromising it's a really good point it's a really good I think it come it boils down to how you are like what how what's your way of doing things the book Atomic habits James Clear mhm one of the first book I read after after I didn't read any books because High School make me hate reading it's prob the first book I read and it says they make it so easy you can't say no and that's that's very true like start with 10 push-ups per day beginning new what took you so long I guess your 9 to5 became a 9 to9 this is where people realize I am 12 years old this is my favorite part of launching startups is you know I haven't done any of those videos this year the last one it was with mat Maki no go everywhere Dad they are my friends I talk to them oh for logo Fest which was December last year logo Fest the fre you made 5,000 in 3 days yes that's it one why do you make the video before lunch because the internet is crowded and at some points if you want to get your message across the room you have to find something that feels like you mhm that people will give their time to watch what you have to offer and because of that they'll give me like a minute of their time to look at what I have to offer and it happens that eventually if they're learning if they're trying to learn how to code they might watch like they might visit the site and might even purchase and I think the the purpose of this video is eventually to get attention in a way that feels genuine that feels like my way of getting attention basically CH P found the right movie for me I know what I'm going to sell I know roughly you know the angle the angle is very important once we talk again is I'm not making just another course and you're making the course to learn to code for entrepreneurs not employees entrepreneurs this is very important because then you can dit 90% of all the stuff you have to learn when you're a software engineer or an employee so it's a minimal course that teach you everything you need to know to go from zero to a software I think when you I mean like most people I guess you eat around 2 hours before bed M you eat that 700 and you go to bed at 9:00 or you eat at 8:00 you go to bed at at 10:00 we used to do that and then we started to do 6: and 5: p.m. 3 4 5 hours before bed and we realize that when we go back to the original 2 hours before bed the heartbeat is actually racing M and when you do four five hours before it's like you're much more relaxed data says we have better deep sleep and I feel much better as well MH you do feel any difference after I don't see much difference between five and 7 hours like we do now yeah for us I think the big shift is at least 4 hours before bed you're done 4 hours before bed you don't touch any food even not water so you don't go to toilet when you wake up now it's 8:00 p.m. still rolling man we never working that late yeah we normally finish work at least at 6 and wow a long day I think it's honestly one of the stress most stressful lunch I've ever done yeah yeah I'm launching late because of Black Friday like I have a deadline and so I have to check every little thing like there's so many things like from check out to customer dashboard that there's no you know like everything is responsive it's like works on mobile like crazy just crazy do you think you will ever make it today Black Friday I I there's no way I don't make it yesterday I was actually yesterday was a big failure who were supposed to launch yesterday I I realized I don't know anything like I thought it would take me one day to make the video and it took me 2 days and now I'm like super late still the countdown 4 hours I'm going to release okay so now right now I'm literally this is the Tweet I'm about to click publish it goes live Twitter thread LinkedIn whatever and then I'm going to use cod fast uh data fast to monitor the traffic on COD fast how many month of work this is 9 month of work in the making one click for 9 month should I click oh what I clicked I clicked it's publishing wa the first sale alert oh man that makes you so happy it is not a z product so it's time to check the revenue Bo it's it's not even 24 hour yet 23k 17 hour 23k I've never seen I mean holy this is D first dashboard $1,000 in the last 24 hours she first doing great and this is absolute Madness oh my God my man I mean look at that it's spread across the world French people what's happening look at that we launched 36 hours ago one day and a half ago 68,000 honestly I don't know if it's real no way what the hell man there's no way there's no way honestly I'm happy you're recording this because this is this will never happen again this is just insane wait me we sent 11,000 visitors on Coast 11,000 visitors and it makes 50k it's like a 4 $4 per visitors if you're more than $1 that's amazing and $4 is a god level 2% conversion rate on a product that cost at minimum 150 bucks all mostly Twitter mostly Twitter yeah wow 7,000 from Twitter wow that's a lot oh so 7,000 visitors yeah that's that's quite a lot yeah wow there's so many people who didn't know how to code following you and wanting to man this is so yeah this is so crazy yeah that makes me so happy man one of the best moments I I like most Joy I feel cuz I mean this is extremely happy but this will like f like dopamine you know like tomorrow we'll fade away but seeing from all those students a lot of them will follow the entire course and do something and get results and that's what happened with sheep fast and the she fast testimon the greed of love like the wall of Love on cheep fast is probably it's honestly my happiest place to go on the internet go there and I see all those people who at some point trusted me give me a little bit of money and then got RS and like thank you Mark I quit my job thank you Mark I make my first doll on the internet like I love making software but digital product and info product like this how much happiness it brought to the person who make the the info product crazy crazy crazy crazy I got in the bank and I the simple analytics [Applause] guys oo where oh a little hello I am still sick but we're doing it anyway uh it's been almost 7 days I launched cast and this is a little recap of what happened uh it made close to $200,000 us in a week and this is absolutely mental I had no idea it would work this well I knew it would work somehow I'll show you why later but this much man this is just crazy so I want to break down a few things about marketing and finding ideas first let's quickly look at the launch uh you can see here uh this is number of visitors so almost 50,000 visitors and uh whooping $4.4 generated per visitor which is again this is insane I've never had this before the best product I've had was ship fast and he was close to $2 per visitor at his best so this here shows me like there is something big coming Revenue wise it's mostly coming from Twitter uh YouTube and a little bit of LinkedIn and I guess Google or people who've heard of it on social media and search for it I'm PR impressed by how spreaded it is there there's like purchases from a little bit all over the planet which makes me very happy so um I saw this tweet from Max a couple days ago that he thought the course would never sell and there are a few things at play here the first one is when we come up with ideas on what's to build what is what could be a promise promising idea you want to check a few boxes one of the first one is you want to build something that solve your own problems I see too many people coming up with what if I combine this Tech Plus that market and I make a product out of nowhere the problem with that is like it's pure blind guesses and well it's fun you can ship an idea in one week but but the odds of success are very unlikely product like this one's invoice this is not making crazy amount of money if we look at it is making around $1,000 per month but it's zero maintenance zero customer support it's fully on autopilot and it's working like clockwork every single month and I know it would work because I experience the issue I know that when I pay invoices on stripe I have to give them 4% to generate a PDF and so by solving my own problem could potentially guess that some other people have the same issue as me and so that almost guarantees me that if I build a product I will have customers now I knew how to code already I don't need a course to learn how to code the reason I came up with this idea is because I have a YouTube channel and I read every comments on this YouTube channel and one of my best performing videos if you search for how to you end up on finding gems on what people want to achieve how to buy domain name for your project how to build this amazing UI Builders how to make a responsive website how to make those websites seeing these comments over and over tells me that people somewhere on the internet have a problem and it appears that I have the solution cuz I know how to code and this this is how I came up with the idea of code fast a course that teaches people how to code to build those tiny businesses if you go to udm and you search for JavaScript or react you will find hundreds of Great Courses already so with SC fast I knew that there was a huge demand and I also knew that the market is very competitive and when you enter a competitive market you want to have one marketing angle you you want to have you want to find one thing that sets you apart from all the other competitors and the good part is I use UD me myself to teach myself how to code and I remember seeing those courses where you would have 68 hours of content for JavaScript and then you would have 70 hours of content for no JS and another 30 hours to learn HTML and then in the end you would have like a package of like 300 hours to learn how to code the reason those courses are so long is because they are main for people who want to have a job and since the job market is a zero sum game which means that if your neighbor gets the job you won't get the job you have to compete on who has the most skills so in this case it makes sense to to learn as much as you can so you can compete better against others but the thing is in my case I only care about making tiny websites on the internet I just want to be me my computer a few of my customers and that's it I'm not I don't intend to build a massive app for millions of people that requires a team of software engineer to handle and because of that those courses here are like a pain for me I don't want to go over 300 hours of content and this is how I came up with this idea of a course that would teach people only the minimum the the those core skills needed in order to build a tiny internet business and just like this I had one marketing angle that set me apart from all the other alternative and on top of that I remember when I learned how to code it was a pain to search for what should I learn what is Javascript what is HTML how those those thing combine together what is a back end what is a front end I had to think about how the the entire thing works what I did with cast is I bundled everything I explained uh students how to go from literally zero to an actual finished product is not about a specific part on the journey it's about the entire Journey which I bet is one of the reason the launch was so successful and then there is another one mistake that I see lots of people making my friend Yuri asked me what would you do with the money and then it made me think okay if I don't have to work for money what would I do with it and I realized that actually I want to build an alternate school for kids who were not good at school or for people who just don't feel like life Clicks in in general like like finding a job or like working for a big company or whatever for people who just you know want the freedom of not being dependent on others just have a computer and be free that is for some reason what is driving me and if you look at the Journey of everything I built everything resonate with what I want to do what goal I want to achieve now if we look with one of my very first product which was called viral buts it's a little software that uh that made my first internet dollar and then somehow let me move to Bal because he was making a little bit of money here I was helping escape room businesses get more money it was like a marketing tool for businesses and he worked he made a couple thousand per month but it did not resonate with me I have close to zero care for the escap room businesses I I don't specially care about them I care about people who want to do s with their computers but a business I'm not so sure and these product never really took off because once again it was not align with things I do things I like and I see lots of people out there who again are trying to combine uh this tech for that market but they don't care about the tech they don't care about the market and they try to make something out of that but I feel like there's a sort of like a a power that knows how much the product resonate with you what is the fit from the thuner and the product and I think if you want to get reach you have to do something that aligns with yourself okay now talking about marketing um of course having an audience on Twitter and YouTube really helps launching products but uh if you can see here this tweet got 1.3 th000 likes this is the only promotion I've done for the course and it would never ever get half a million views if I didn't have make this video here it's a skit where I play morphus in Matrix and I try to convince Neo Who currently has a 9 to5 job to quit his job and learn to code for himself the reason I did this is first because I absolutely love making this kind of videos but also because it works well it's like an ad that's pleasurable to watch and even though you're not necess interested in what I have to sell you might want to share this to a friend because it's fun and that's how this tweet went viral and got half a million views the launch part of your product is very important you want to uh craft everything to be perfect when you launch and just like in real life where conversion rate matters that improve the actual conversion rate of the product so even though you don't have an audience you can play around with writing a beautiful story of how you came up with this product idea you can go on figma and create a beautiful chart that explains your product you can make something that gives a good first impression for your product okay now I'm talking about what is next for cut fast uh at the moment I'm recovering from my sickness I couldn't work for the past 3 days I've set up an affiliate program where um people can uh become Affiliates and then they would earn 30 30 to 30% commission to 50% commission uh since the conversion rate is really good on the site Affiliates are already making lots of money at the moment I think they're making over $1,000 per day I added this little uh slider here that gives an idea of how much money you can make if you get I don't know let's say five people trying the course you can make actually 300 bucks and at the same time I am trying Facebook ads so uh the campaign has been running for just a couple days I think the first day Facebook was learning who is the audience and then now the results are pretty impressive yesterday was $60 per purchase today is $13 per purchase which is extremely good really actually really really really good uh it's early to tell how far they would go for now I'm only spending I think uh $70 per day for The Campaign which is not uh much but I think in this case it's worth the try because the product converts really well and I've had luck with ship fast in the past where I would spend $50 and get $150 uh in revenue for this I am not alone my good friend Nico janen is helping me run those ads is excellent at Facebook ads and he buil this little guide here called makers guide uh which I vot and it's excellent it teaches you everything you need to know to make good ads on Facebook so if you have a product that you think is worth sharing through ads definitely check it out it's a masterpiece and then as soon as I'm recovered I am going to work on the AI teacher so I want to train an AI on the course so it knows the captions it knows where the student is in the course at the moment it knows the code of the course and is able to help the students learn whether it's explain things or debug when students are stuck I guess I'll will need a little bit more of those Ginger cheese we're so back oh my God spent an entire week I was sick and it's the first night of sleep where I sleep properly and that was a crazy week I wish I was nut sick and enjoyed a little Bard but still the week was completely crazy I know some of you got the course out there thank you for that and I'm very excited for your coding Journey learning how to Cod change my life I hope he does the same for you um I'm going for a surf session one of the last of the year because we're going to Portugal with my wife in a couple of days uh if you're in Portugal I'll be around AR area and Lisbon just drop me a DM somewhere on Twitter and maybe we can do something the this is one of the happiest moments of my life and it only happened 27 times there we go my man there we go that's my 20 27th I think project whatever they're not all on the wall but all the ones that I built recently are there and uh this this little portfolio of small bits is growing EX excited for 2025 I almost forgot this is likely to be the end the final vlog of the year so it's good time to wish you a merry Christmas if you celebrate and of all just a happy New Year and crush it for 2025 until the next one I hope you keep shipping

TITLE: I failed 27 startups... and made $1M as a SOLO developer (my story)
VIDEO ID: eqgUjOByexc
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqgUjOByexc
================================================================================

my name is Mark and this is the story of how I went from living with my parents and $0 on my bank account to making $1 million as a solo developer in less than 3 years this is a story of a regular kid who had no idea what to do in life I got addicted to video games and lost my self-confidence in my 20s so I needed to change I started building tiny internet businesses along the way I learned everything on YouTube whether it's marketing coding and even speaking English and after 27 businesses I made my first $1 million now seven of these internet businesses make $62,000 per month I work on any project I want I can move my office from Bali to France to Korea i surf every morning I prioritize my sleep I can spend time with my wife I have designed the life I've always wanted but the journey has been very challenging most of my businesses failed and I gave up multiple times and at my lowest point I run ads on adults website making $4 in two month before falling into depression so in this video I'm going to share my story transparently from everything I did and what I learned from it and I hope it inspires anyone on the journey so let's get [Music] started I was born in no Sur a little town near Paris in October 1993 I have two beautiful younger sisters my parents grew up poor but work hard to become engineers and this is important for the next part and my childhood was really beautiful all I remember is me in my bedroom building Legos all day long Middle School is when the trouble started I didn't like School the teachers were old and boring the topics were outdated we were learning old French used like 500 years ago and on top of that as students we were ranked against each other based on our grades and I never understood why two students be compared against each other instead of being just compared to themselves I was not interested in school so I had bad grades the teachers would put me at the back of the classroom and label me as the disturbing kid it almost became my identity now I'm 30 years old and I still have n Mayors about not being prepared for a school exam and things got worse at home my parents who had worked their way out of poverty through education expected me to do the same but I just couldn't connect so I was constantly fighting at school and at home and I felt like I was rubeling against everything eventually I was expelled from school and my parents had to meet with the director to get me back in I knew I pushed too far so I made a promise to my parents that I would graduate when I turned 18 I had to do something with my life but I didn't know what in French society there's a strong belief that if you don't go to university then you are less smart it's like there are two path and if you choose the wrong one then too late you miss your chance and it's fun because after graduating from my master's degree in computer science people started to see me as a smart engineer but I was a total scam I knew nothing everything I learned to run my businesses are thoughts from YouTube Google and the internet but I didn't know that back then and my parents pushed me toward University so in 2013 I got accepted in a university to do a master's degree the school was 2 hours away from a parents place in TW so I moved into my own little apartment I was so excited because For the first time in my life I was free but that's also when things became chaotic since I didn't like school I didn't like University either and now with a freedom to skip classes I studed to play video games all day long I played World of Warcraft 8 hours a day and by the end of the year I had spent 65 days in the game I also picked up a smoking habit and completely ignored my studies things got so bad after the first year that I was kicked out just like in high school my parents had to meet with the director to get me back in and I remember my mom pleading with him asking what are they going to do with me if they didn't give me another chance I had to promise to the university I would get good enough grades and once again I made a promise to my parents that I would do the minimum to graduate I got back on track reduced video games and I started dating a girl then something unexpected happened in 2015 my girlfriend got accepted for a student Exchange program in Hong Kong I was was devastated by the idea that she would leave me so I decided to do whatever it takes to follow her but my grades were not good enough to get into the same program but I found a loophole the only way to be in Hong Kong at the same time as her is to find an internship there there were two problems first my English was terrible and second I had no valuable skill for the job market but I was so afraid of losing her that I didn't care and that's when I made the first real bet on myself I will get that internship in Hong Kong no matter what to learn English I switched the settings on my computers from French to English and every single day I would struggle to understand what was going on on my interface and I also made a rule for myself to never Google anything in French anymore I can only use English it was 10 years ago and up to these days it remains one of the best decision I've ever taken then I needed the skills to apply for a job and since I knew nothing I had to find some something I could learn on the internet that's how I came up with the idea of becoming a programmer but time was limited and I couldn't become a software engineer suddenly so I went on Wikipedia and I googled the fundamentals concept of programming just so that I knew what it was and I send countless resumés and miraculously one of them accepted my application that trip in Hong Kong changed my life The Internship itself was a disaster I didn't know how to code they figured it out and I almost got got fired but living in Hong Kong opened my eyes to a completely new world new culture new food new ambition new mindset for the first time I realized that there was more to life that I could ever imagine I came back home transformed I somehow managed to graduate by coping on my neighbors during the exams so I didn't learn much I didn't even go to the ceremony because I didn't care about University but I had a new goal in mind I wanted something different around this time in 2016 I watched The Social Network the movie about how Mark zukerberg created Facebook that's when I had an epiphany I believed I will be the next Mark Zuckerberg I just needed a billion dollar idea back then I was climbing and I always struggle to find a partner that's how I come up with a new concept Tinder for sports lover an app that will match you with people with similar sport Hobbies I moved back to my parents house which was tough because I lost my freedom and to support that I found a job as a waiter for $10 an hour it was an interesting experience because I learned that if I smile which is something very rare for waiters in Paris then I would get more tips I realized that people don't just pay for the product they pay for the experience it was my first deep into the marketing World during the day I worked on building my mobile app the problem is that I had zero knowledge in coding and even though I had studied computer science it was nothing practical either Theory or outdated dinosaur programming languages I wasn't sure how to learn how to code properly so I just Google how to create a button for a mobile app I found this library of components called ionic and I felt amazing I felt like I could build an entire mobile app with just a couple hundred lines of code at least that's what I thought I was just reusing beats of code without understanding the fundamentals I spent an entire year building this app and it was a total disaster the more code I was adding to the app the buggier the app guts one day I talk to an entrepreneur a real entrepreneur who asked me how I plan to make money that's when everything collapsed and that was my first slap in the face I realized that my brilliant ID would never exist and even if it did it would never make money my entire world fell apart it was the first time for me to try to do something different to prove a point and it was going nowhere I felt like a failure I remember crying at night with my girlfriend unable to explain what's wrong I just felt miserable and I knew I needed a change when things started to go downhill a high school friend of mine Sasha reached out to me he was in South Korea and told me he could raise $100,000 from venture capitalist to start an AI startups and he wanted me on board with nothing going right in my life I accepted and I was so disillusioned with the past that I quit everything my app my girlfriend my family and I moved to South Korea in 200 17 at first things were great I finally found a friend who shared my ambition to create something we agreed that I will be the CTO so I bought a JavaScript course on UD and I started to learn programming from the ground up our startups focus on predicting the price of flight tickets to tell customers when is the best time to buy we had two investors and hired two employees I built the mobile app using react native and the team built the API and the Machine learning algorithm we had a great MVP to show but no one was interested in after a few months we realized that this was going nowhere we were both engineers at heart and we didn't know how to get customers an ambitious idea and a great product I was making the same mistake I did back in France just a year earlier so we decided to go our separate race in 2018 and here I was again alone on the other side of the planet with poor cutting skills and no idea what to do next so I started to question my choices I lost my self-confidence and started smoking again around the time I met a current girl who worked at the same startup centers and me we started dating and she became my girlfriend one day I saw an ad on Facebook selling couple gloves mittens for couples to hold their hands together I thought it was genous and perfect for the current market where nothing like this existed and since I had failed two big projects earlier I was excited to try something new and simpler my girlfriend was also also excited so we decided to work on the project together we started a small closing brand called Glovers gloves for lovers we worked with a lovely Korean Grandma who knitted all the 50 gloves for us and we did everything else from designing the gloves to creating the logo it was fun first I started selling the gloves on Facebook replicating the ad I had seen but it was a total flop my bank account was near zero and we had 50 unsold glove I burned a couple hundred because I knew nothing about ads so we decided to go industry to sell them we managed to sell a few making my first dollar as an entrepreneur I was happy and a little proud but the lifestyle was pretty unhealthy we would go out late at night in the freezing korein witer getting drunk in order to stay warm barely making any profit so in March 2018 we closed down the project I had no income and no savings so my girlfriend and I moved to a $500 a month underground apartment in sale it was Tiny humid there were centipedes and other kinds of insects but this is all we could afford I found a few gigs as a background actor making sometimes up to $100 a day which helped us survive for a few more months I wanted to return to making apps and websites but I was frustrated with my past failures around that time I met a guy named Andre who became my friend I shared with him my frustration and he told me sell it before you build it my engineer mind couldn't comprehend that but he was smart so so I decided to give it a try but I had no idea what to sell so I came up with a universal business idea help businesses get more customers and since I loved playing games I thought that the product could be a gamification marketing tools for escap room businesses in other words it's a game that escape room businesses could give to their customers to entertain them that would promote the escap room business when they're done playing the game so that the escape room would get more customers I was in Japan for a Visa Run staying in a cheap hot and noisy guest house with poor Wi-Fi I was paralyzed with fear to have someone on the phone and to sell them something I felt like I was scamming them but I took the call anyway the person on the other side was danela escape room owner in Perth Australia despite my awkwardness and all the wrong things I say during this call um so um I REM um um I sent you um a demo of the of of she said yes after 40 minutes on September 8th 2018 I made my first dollar on the internet this is the money on my P PayPal account danela paid $300 for the setup and $99 a month in subscription I was so happy I felt like I finally made it and the feeling of getting money from the internet with just me and my computer it felt amazing and on a side note danela ended up being my customer for the next 5 years and spent $4,000 for my software and all it took was a single code email I still had mediocre coding skills but I build a software for her and she was happy with it and at the same time I bought courses on UD in order to improve my coding skills I was so excited about getting my first customer that I repeated the process called emails calls and improve the software and and by the end of the month I had closed three customers as the business grew my life started to get better I quit smoking I started working out again and I ate healthier food my girlfriend quit her job and since we had no reason to stay in Korea we moved to Bali Indonesia in the middle of 2018 life in B was great it was cheap it was sunny I even learned how to surf and I became addicted to it I kept the same routine Marketing in the morning and coding on the afternoon the business grew quickly to $1,000 in monthly recurring revenue and picked at $4,000 at the end of 2019 I increased the price to $199 per month and I played around with annual deals for $2,000 yesterday I did two hours of marketing and today I get the payment from the guy from Melbourne so I get just earn $1,000 and here is my reward and I remember selling a few of those annual plans and it felt like I was a king I was so happy I was not broke anymore and I also felt like I had a purpose and then in March 2020 covid hits because of the lockdowns escape room businesses were forced to close so I decided to pose all the subscriptions and the software I built for 2 years went from $4,000 a month to zero in 1 minute on top of that I was a little scared being in Bell not knowing what would happen luckily it was not bad there was no real lockdown so I went surf that's how I met a new friend who became my best friend I started making YouTube videos and I didn't think much about entrepreneurship for a little while when Co began to ease in August 2020 my wife and I went back to friend and decided to get married so we could stay together no matter what the wedding was beautiful and even her parents could come from South Korea but we couldn't come back to Bali because they suddenly imposed another lockdown so we were stuck in France living with my parents my previous software started to make money again around $15,000 per month but it was pretty slow and I got a little bit bored of it after focusing on it for 2 years so I decided to start something new since I had some customers into the escape room industry I decided to work for the same customers but build a little different product this time it would be a little widget that would sit on the customers's website so that their visitors could play a game directly onto the website have F get a discount coupon for The Escape BR business and book right away it was the first time for me making games I learned everything from YouTube I had so much fun and on top of that it was working well I beta tested with some of my customers and it increased their comption rate from 3% to 3.5% just with one little script I was really excited about the product but the world itself was not really in a good position for marketing tools especially not escape room businesses so the launch was really slow at the peak it R $300 in monthly recuring revenue and at the same time the churn for my previous software was growing so I decided to change completely and work on something else I was not really sure what I wanted but I wanted something smaller something simpler something that I could ship quickly now we are entering a weird phas in my life my sister who is a doctor explained me how the male bladder works and why some drops of urine could fall down after leaving the toilet and she also explained me how to fix it so I decided to sell this information I spent a couple days creating a PDF to explain how it works how to fix it and I build a website called the golden Plumber where you could purchase the PDF for $4 I printed stickers with QR code that led to my website and I stuck them in toilets all over Paris I thought it would be the perfect place because this is exactly where customers need it but after a few weeks and no sales I give up on the stickers but not on the business I think I needed to prove something to myself so I started to run ads on adult websites I made a little video with my face and started to pour money into it and one month later I had one C customer and made $4 by this time I was 27 years old living with my wife at my parents' place all of my previous projects miserably failed I had no savings I was getting out of shape the reason I left my home was to prove that there was an alternative to the current education system and years later I came back in the exact same home with nothing but failures I felt like a failure for weeks I couldn't get the thoughts out of my head in one random morning while making coffee I started to cry for no reason I went back to my room cried again and then anger started to feel inside of me something that I had no control over I started to shout and I needed to express this anger so I punched the wall in my room four times I didn't even realize but each punch was hurting my wrist I kept smashing until my parents came afraid and worried and had to stop me I spent the next hours with my mom and my girlfriend on the sofa trying to understand what happened without finding the answer I felt miserable and I knew I needed a change I made a big U-turn and I decided to do something I never thought I would do I took a job I wanted to become a software engineer mostly because it's remote and also because I had a little bit of coding knowledge that could help but I wasn't really a software engineer so at the same time I was sending application I was learning through YouTube about apis nodejs react Etc at first they were interested about my application because I had some cool experi experiences to share but they realized that I was actually not a proper software engineer so I got rejected but one of the company was hiring aggressively so they overlooked the gaps in my experience and after two interviews I lended the job and the hiring person told me that I would be working for Ty Lopez the famous internet marketer knowledge I didn't know I would work for him because he was not mentioned in the offer but I was pretty excited and at the same time it paid almost $9,000 per month an amount of money that I've never seen in my life life suddenly felt different for the first time in years I had a sense of purpose I was told what to work on and by the end of the day I would have produced something valuable for that person I felt worthy something that I haven't felt in a long time plus unlike entrepreneurship I didn't have to work all day long so I had time for me to read books and get back in shape I thought I hated reading because of middle school they gave us like 500 years old books to read I couldn't understand a word and I didn't like it but since I could choose what to read I started to love it and it's been 3 years I started reading I've read around 30 book and it has changed my life completely the first book I read is called why we sleep by Matthew Walker I used to set up an early morning alarm so I could work more and the book completely changed my perspective I started to prioritize my sleep and I instantly felt better less stress more focus and overall happier it is by far what impacted the most my mental and physical health and I'm still wondering why they don't teach us that in school instead of the Pythagorean theorem and since I had more time I decided to improve my coding skills I wasn't really sure why but I thought it would be great either if I need to find a job later or if I just want to build better apps so I bought cheap UD me course and learned the fundamentals again of JavaScript HTML CSS and react by the end of 2021 the covid lockdown in belly had been lifted so my wife and I decided to return back home since I could work remotely it was not an issue but one week after landing in Bal I received a call and got fired but surprisingly I didn't care I discovered the social media Twitter because Ty Lopez was running polls to question his audience and I found a tweet from Peter levels a solo developer who built tiny startups from anywhere in the world and he built these startups in public sharing everything he does and everything he learns a new wave of Entrepreneurship less ambition that VC funded startup but more freedom with no employees a smaller project I was hooked so when I got fired I knew it was time for me to go back to entrepreneurship with a different strategy December 2021 $30,000 on the bank account back in Bal in a new dream I was so frustrated with the past that I told myself I would do things differently so I set five rules for myself rule number one I prioritize sleep I have seen in the past how much it impacts my mood and my overall happiness so no matter what I will always prioritize sleep rule number two I will share everything I do transparently on Twitter that way I could connect with other entrepreneurs and never feel lonely again rule number three I committed to shipping the smallest version of my idea no more spending one year in my bedroom overthinking a project I will show it to the world as fast as possible rule number four I promise myself I will always launch my project and try to show it as as many people as I can rule number five no more outcome goals but only process goals so instead of having a goal of losing weight my goal would be working out every single day instead of focusing on something I cannot control like how much weight I'm going to lose I'm going to focus on something I can control like how many times a day I'm going to work out that way I approach the journey as a collection of small projects even if my project is a total flop and nobody wants to use it it still grow my portfolio of little websites I started the journey by launching a website called mood to movie a simple website that would recommend movies based on your mood I wanted to test the strategy and I got lucky it went viral on Hacker News which bring a couple thousands of visitors on the site and also grew my Twitter following I also created habits Garden a gamified habit tricker people would set up their daily habits like reading books or working out they would get some quest to challenge themselves and they would get rewards like gems if they complete the quest that way they could grow a little digital garden and stick to to their daily habits people love the app and there was a payroll for the premium version and the app grew to 500 in monthly recuring revenue and I keep repeating the same process over and over one idea a few weeks launch it and move on by the end of 2022 I had built 10 websites that way it was not making much money but I was having a lot of fun and my Twitter audience was growing there were some moments that were really slow nothing much was happening and I remember feeling lonely just like in the past and sometimes questioning my choices whether or not I should maybe take a job as a software engineer in 2022 my best friend passed away my wife and I were silent for a couple day trying to process the loss he is an amazing person and taught me that there is a little gem inside of everyone his death made me reflect on the journey and reminded me that the fern is in the process not the outcome so I kept shipping apps I found my first success with a new approach making fun videos skit when launching a new startup I did videos with Joe Rogan Leonardo DiCaprio Matthew mcon I even did a video playing World of Warcraft In Real Life as a little reminder for the University time it was unconventional but people loved it and that's how my Twitter audience went from 1,000 followers to 10,000 followers early 2023 after about a year I started to run out of Muddy so I shifted my focus toward apps that solve real problems painkillers and not vitamins I also focused on app that have a payall so no more free plans and no more free users in 2023 I built Indie page a little software that lets anyone build a beautiful portfolio page it went really well and made a couple thousand dollar in Revenue within the first month which helped with my financial worries around that time the AI Trend was so big that I decided to give it a try I built make Ling it's a website generator people would input some text and it would output an entire website sites the launch went well generating an extra couple thousand in Revenue but I really didn't care about the market or the customers so I got bored of it at this point I had projects all over the place so I decided to sell some of them in order to focus I sold Mech Ling for 35,000 I sold habits Garden for $10,000 and I also sold that second software I built for escape room backs in 2020 for $4,000 and he was still making $50 per month in monthly recurring Revenue in August 2023 I had built somewhere for 15 to 16 new websites and I wanted to improve my strategy to ship faster so I created a little Cod base for myself and it was working so well that I decided to sell it I called the website cheap fast and I launched it a week later I told my wife we would be lucky if we make $100 24 hours later it had made $4,000 the biggest hit I had ever had I remember being in Hong Kong for a Visa Run sleeping in a 12 squ met bedroom room the airport just closed because of the typhoon and the building was shaking but I didn't care I finally had found product Market fit and it felt incredible I was so excited I couldn't sleep for three nights in its first month chifas made $50,000 in Revenue so I kept working on it listening to users adding new components opening an affiliate program and as I build everything in public sharing my Revenue my Twitter following also grew but I knew that Chief fast couldn't be 100% of my focus because its value came from the lessons I learned shipping software so I kept shipping a startups a month I built buy dispute to prevent chargebacks on stripe I built logo fast a free tool to make logos pretty quickly I built Zenvo a tool to generate invoices for European customers I focused on startups that solve my own problems and each of the project I launched made money anywhere from a couple hundred to a couple thousand per month and at the same time times I kept improving ship fast with my learnings in January 2024 I was still making around $50,000 per month I was having fun so I decided to start YouTube I gave myself another process goal I would make one video per week in less than 24 hours no matter what and up until this day I have stuck to this New Year resolution at first nothing happened for 3 months then I made a video showcasing the 23 websites that I built and YouTube decided to push my videos the channel Grew From almost 0 followers at the beginning of the year to 990,000 people in August 2024 thank you so much and at the same time my Rue doubled and at the top in April 2024 I made $143,000 with all my projects combined at this point I started to have couple hundred of thousand dollar on my bank account way more money than I could ever imagine owning at 30 years old it removed all the stress of wondering how to pay next month rent and it made me feel awesome to think that I might never have to work for money again that brings me to today life is a little simpler but overall nothing has changed I still surf every morning work on my tiny businesses on the daytime and enjoy a good evening with my wife the biggest shift is my mindset now I am addicted to building startups and I can't wait for the next hit and right now I'm working on two big project that I'm about to launch and I am so excited I did not make this video to brag or to sell you a course I made this video because I was so frustrated with the education system I wish someone would have shown me earlier there was another way you shouldn't take advice from just anyone especially not someone with a mustache but if there is one piece of advice for you this is it tomorrow you'll wish you would have started today start now build something build anything as chpt or Google when you're stuck find a way to make it fun through a challenge or doing it with a friend each project will teach you something and the right project can change your life and that's the end of this video If you enjoyed it please consider subscribing that means a lot and until the next one I hope you just ship it

TITLE: How I Do Marketing as a Solo Developer (VLOG)
VIDEO ID: BHshHvKmJYQ
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHshHvKmJYQ
================================================================================

so this is how I made $5,000 us with a free tool I built in 3 [Music] days I am launching a course called cancel du to volcano what happened is absolutely crazy this is the marketing cure sell it before you make it and I did not discount any of my product $55,000 what it it's free free app yeah it's 100% free it leaves completely separate to my other apps it's Standalone app I see sometimes people on Twitter sharing like oh if you want to make a logo try this by Mark because it's free people who reshare it so it brings constant traffic and then there's a little ad on the right side because if you need a logo maybe you need to a code base to ship your startup faster and so that brings I track exactly how much traffic it brings to ship fast and then when they pay I know exactly how many people bot ship fast because they discovered logo FAS oh so even though you don't have audience and you hate marketing so you just build a free tool that you like to make and then share it with people then make money this is especially for developers like me who are a little bit too addicted at making stuff this is the marketing cure cuz you never actually do marketing you build a tool you ship it because it's free people share about it and you have to make a great tool as well and then you get free traffic that's the best way to start getting traffic also grow an audience I usually plug my name under it so so people discover the me through the tool so you grow traffic you grow an audience and you get customers from it and it's like I think it needs to I need to make an entire video about that hello bear for millionaire St T yeah well why are you here we're here because I need to get this cut this way too long for now and tomorrow we are going to Korea and we're going to go to one of your best friend's wedding with te style are I don't know up you look good like a French rooster you've been calling it the local barbershop for a long time no I think it is yeah since they I mean actually when we mooved from Korea because we were like we had zero you earn 1K a month I think in Korea even less yeah and then we moved to Bali and it was 2018 life was way cheaper mhm and remember we we had like maybe 1K per month and we live like kings we had a swimming pool we had a like a nice bedroom in a Shir Villa it's crazy how you can reduce burn rates like increase your life by just moving to a different country I think maybe the numbers have changed a bit but I think with $1,000 a month you can leave great in B this is $3 like the haircut but after earning L of money why do still come to local Garber shop I don't know man I just like it feels natural here I don't feel like I people are genuine not pretending just so kind after tomorrow when I'm gone he's going to have more customers he's going to behave exactly the same he's not trained for me he's just he's just doing a thing mhm I like that authentic experience a lot let's see how your haircut would become like a local people man I choose number number eight French crop number eight yes makeover wow look at you so it is uh 7 7:50 p.m. which is 1 hour before my bedtime and I'm entering the most important part of my day I spent an entire hour to wind down and have bit of sleep because when I started the journey 6 years ago I remember I used to sacrifice hours of sleep so I could get work done more and I would often get tired and emotional during the daytime and 3 years ago I read a book that changed my life called why we sleep by Matthew Matthew Walker and that reframed how I thought about sleep I stopped thinking that more hours of sleep means less hour during the daytime but I see it as an investment for a better day and since I prioritize my sleep like never before you almost become like a religion I have the best happiest days of my life whether it's my body physically or whether it's in my head mentally even when nothing is happening I was grinding I had zero followers I made Zer I just felt good all the time I I try to get almost 100% every day and most of it is because of this wind down routine I read for 15 to 30 minutes then I do a few breathing exercise it's a method called 468 I think where you inhale with your nose for four times then hold for six times and then exhale with the mouse for eight times when I met Brian Johnson one of my hero in Singapore a few months ago he told me that he also struggle he recommended me to do this kind of exercise and this is working so well now I I really sleep so easily and to finish I just sit in the sofa and a few things I also do that really improve um especially if you have a deviated septum here and you snore at night I wear those patch on my nose which opens uh the nazle nostrils and help me breathe better with the nose otherwise I just cannot breathe and this change my life like crazy I used to get about an hour of deep sleep now thanks to this I also sleep on the side and I get two hours of deep sleep every night this is really a game changer so if you snore really consider buying one of those oh and and one thing that is also very important it's about those red light here that makes really chill relaxing mood uh there's no blue light there is no screen for the entire hour and then the light will keep dimming dimming diming until it reaches my bedtime at something around 8:45 p.m. okay so this is how I made $5,000 with a free tool I built in 3 days and how you can come up with your own free tool and Market your startup for $0 so this is the free tool in question it's a very simple tool where you can create logos uh based on icons you pick here and um and make whatever logo you like and it's promoting on the right side a little startup of mine called ship fast I track how many people click on this link it sends them to this website right here and if they end up making a purchase I know it in my database so this business here is already converging well and it's just a matter of sending more traffic that's how I came up with this idea of building a little logo maker because the reason is if someone needs a logo then they might need to build a website after and this is exactly what my startup does it help them build websites faster now there are many many other ways to come up with free tools ideas one of the popular SEO tool out there SEO hre which is an SEO uh software you can do a bunch of stuff from keyword planning domain Authority Etc they have four five free tools just like this one where you can have a little uh glimpse of what you can get if you purchase this software this one is a very specific where you can find keywords uh search like how many people search for those keywords for a specific keyword it give you a few information and of course if you want to get more of that you can get started and purchase their paid plan so they took one feature of their main software and made it available for free and a little bit limited on the internet and they did that for many other tools and that's how they bring lots of customers another way I do this with one of my habit tracker called habits Garden here people can uh use this app to track the Habit how do I get more customer for habit tracker well I build this thing called visualize habit it's an app that is again free that helps people realize and visualize what they're going to achieve in an entire year if they build tiny habits so for instance they can start their habit greed by saying they want to stretch 5 minutes every uh three times a week and they want to work on their side Hol for uh 16 minutes every day and because sleep is important we also want to say that we want to get eight hours of sleep per night now when they go next then they can see their little grade uh what they going to be uh what they're going to complete in an entire year this gives people a sense of like what are you going to achieve they can share that with their friends if they want they can download that photo and then when they click next they can surprisingly sign up for my habit tracker and when they'll click here they'll end up on the Habit tracker it goes directly through to my website and it Imports all the habits that they created previously you can literally come up with any idea for a free tool to promote your app you want to make sure it takes a few boxes the first one is you want to make sure this free tool is well free it's very important because this is how you go viral this is where we're going to talk about it later this is where you can post your free tool in every uh Community every platform social medias out there and this is how people can spread the world you also want to make sure it has only one feature you don't want to make it complicated you want to make that feature available as soon as people land on the landing page you don't want people to click on buttons you don't want people to you want you don't want to redirect them on pages you don't want to collect emails you don't want any of that you want them to go straight to the point you also want to find an explicit name something that is very easy to remember logo fast is well a tool to make a logo fast and it's very important because now with social media people will share that if it's useful and this is a easy way for people to remember your brand search it on Google and this is how you improve your ranking there and finally this is kind of what I said earlier but you really want to make sure people don't have to sign up because this is going to kill the convers rate build it in a few days and once you're ready there are tons of places you can launch your tool I will link to an article below where um it's a list of all the places you can launch for free so we have R product Hacker News um directory AI directories like there is an AI for that in future pedia for each of them there is a tutorial to help you uh increase the chances that it goes viral use those platforms to LA launch your free to basically you want to drive as much traffic as possible on the launch day so it makes like a little buzz or boom you want people to talk about it on social media Tik Tok Instagram Etc and hope that the tool will keep spreading here's a quick summary of what you get when you start building free tools first you appeal to wider Market just like logo fast there are people who might not be interested in ship fast but they might be interested in a logo second you start to rank for new SEO keyword it could be your brand name but it could also be some keyword that people search on the internet since it's a free tool then you have chances to go viral because this is you know like something is free it's valuable you can easily share it to a friend it also helps you grow an audience because it keeps you accountable every week you build a new free tool you share it on Twitter Youtube Instagram wherever this is your hanging out this will signal to people that you're someone who shows up because every week you have a tiny new tool to share it also make a good first impression if you think about href which is a software that is pretty expensive when they have this free tool it's it's easy to use is friendly I'm like this seems like a good company and we all know that first impression matters a lot and finally if you're a developer like me and you're addicted to spending too much time coding this is one of the best way to be self-driven because you actually never really spend time doing marketing you're basically building tools that will be used as a marketing tool oh man this is our last dinner in belly I'm so sad a true we're leaving tonight yeah I'll miss this yeah yeah I mean this is so healthy I feel so good after eating that true like recently you made domestic change on diet as well you quit sugar and both of us actually so how did putting all this sugar and eating healthy diet impacted you it feels good it feels really good because I remember I used to eat lots of pastas and I would be tired after and I would just sit on the couch and do nothing with this I've almost feel like I can do a workout after that and I'm not hungry it has a I don't know it just feels like it's the like a kind of a power food somehow what is your secret of healthy food I have a lovely wife cook so well actually I think avoiding carbs in general is a good practice or you get get it from like stuff like sweet potatoes you mean avoiding the processed carb but eat lots of like a complex carb yeah with a fiber like vegetable fruits nice entrepreneur not only work is important good sleep good food to fuel your brain is very important okay some some I know I've seen some tweets like because I tweet often about sleep exercise and and diet and I read in the comments some people who mentioned that I only say that because I made it but I think what they don't see and I wish you know I I I wish we recorded YouTube videos earlier is we have been doing this especially like sleep and and and exercise from Day Zero M and this is how I was able to grind for like 2 years with nothing happening that's true even though you don't have much money you can still prti sleep food and work out cuz we still work out through free YouTube video yeah we don't have a gym membership yeah we still eat like we don't go out so actually cooking at home is much cheaper much cheaper yeah even for that I think the fact that you're here it helps a lot oh that's true yeah I wouldn't be able to cook that and work and then also cancel cancel du to volcano everything is canceled to the volcano what happened is absolutely crazy there's a volcano eruption this morning and 90% of the flights are cancelled except today every every flight was cancell but luckily our flight didn't get cancelled because it's at 1:00 a.m. the day after so why every time we fly out there's something like accident always happen we're literally the only flight leaving tonight for Korea easy there is absolutely no one this is immigration I have never seen the airport so empty I can't believe we were boring good morning good morning did you well so well we made it through hurry up wondering how my shoes will like it wow we're in workout completed by 5° I think the cold killer no excuse always work okay so I just landed in Korea and it's going to be a crazy week we're like couple days before the Black Friday and I have been working on a new product for the past N9 month it's it is the biggest project I've ever released I have so much work to be done if the product is available for Black Friday you will know it at the end of this video and at same times I also want to mention about last year's Black Friday where I run kind of an unusual type of deal where I would did not discount the product and I was able to generate 10K Revenue in like 36 hours I want to I want to show you a little bit how I managed to do that so you can replicate but first I need to find a coffee shop and since we're in Korea it shouldn't be hard it up uh big bummer I realize I forgot my uh wire cable so I cannot record videos on my laptop with this camera so I'll do the Black Friday update at home okay I just got back home and I want to share about what I've learned last year from making $111,000 for the Black Friday deal the first one is that you want to stand out this is my way of standing out I make those weird videos where I go live with uh someone famous like uh Jimmy felon uh this is my way of doing things it's not everybody's ways and of course the fact that I have an audience makes everything a little easier but this tweet is a promotional tweet it would never get 500 likes if I hadn't make videos that gives people a reason to stay a little bit on that page during Black Friday there will be tons of other business owners that will try to make their product stand out so try to find something creative something that feels like you to stand out and give people a reason to have a look at your discount so this is the Black Friday page I built for my product and I did not discount any of my product when it comes to making discounts there are two schools of thoughts the first one her people who say like you should make Black Friday discount this is how you make lots of money Etc and there's another school that says do not discount your product because it train your customers to expect discounts so even though you'll have a spike during Black Friday you will Flatline after that and you will be waiting until the next discount I don't know which one is right I believe it's somewhere in the middle I believe Black Friday is a good excuse for people to finally buy a product they've been waiting for but I also believe that you don't want to make your product look cheap and for that reason instead of discounting your product you can create a bundle so what I did back then ship fast one of my uh one of my main product was $149 instead I bundled it with other products I added this Indie page product and this buy dispute product and I made the three of them for the same price as shifas and so the discount is only on the bundle and not a single product and so instead of lowering the value of one product I increase the value inside of the same price if you don't have another product to sell maybe you have a little course or little PDF you can create something of extra value that you can release for The Black Friday and bundle it together with your main products okay I have a few days left before the Black Friday so now it's time to rock and roll you look so fashion yeah yeah me oh I'm oh how much better say we are going to my best friend's wedding and yeah we're going to show you how the typical Korean couple get married here which is very different from our wedding yeah I think Korean people are more efficient we do one hour wedding one hour buffet and then bye-bye and we're going to give them blessing to have a nice honeymoon in New Zealand because they're a big fan of camping are they going there yeah they're going New Zealand oh nice it's interesting this the first time we wear proper clothes in like 6 months H actually like a power by my dad he gave all the clothes for Mark like a shirt pants and a watch I do not watch I do not own any of those clothes it's all all all of her dad's clothes [Applause] it is ready it's been 9 month I am preparing for this single day I am launching a course called coat fast pick backstory here when I started sharing whatever I do on the internet people started to asking me questions and the number one question question people ask is how did you learn how to code I Tau myself how to code back in 2016 and it was really hard I had to spend hours debugging stuff without finding the answer and then sometimes I I would get stuck for weeks honestly it was really not fun but in 2022 since chpt announced the release of their AI models I have been using AI all the time in my code editor and I realized that it's getting much and much easier whenever I don't know anything I just ask chpt and these days I barely don't even code anymore I just write English and review the code that the AI made and at the same time I am not doing anything complicated I'm not like a advanced software engineer for a big company I do simple things like building landing page user dashboards and all these kind of things which is like 10% of what you need to know if you're like a proper software engineer so it is way easier than it used to be because of AI and if you want to build a tiny business you don't need to know everything so I decided to make this course I'm trying to tell the little story of how I learn how to code and how chpt the the arriving of AI changed everything and also the fact that it's pretty new even if it's 2022 it's only been like since 2024 that AI is literally like super efficient inside of your code editor and most of the courses out there are still teaching people how to get a job and uh I think there is a new opportunity for people who just want to learn how to make your ideas into reality and eventually code a light little business so this is the website that you're seeing right here um huge inspiration from gumroad and another site called links as well um you can see uh I have been overthinking the those little uh buttons here and there this is the actual course so there three parts in the course one is about the mindset not just coding but the mindset of you know how to train yourself to use AI for everything um how to ship ideas like the mini smaller version of your app so you don't spend month building a product um a few tips also about marketing and how to make money with your products then there's another part about the fundamentals so a don't like an hour about an hour long version of um HTML CSS and JavaScript how the internet works just the basics so that people following the course know exactly how to how the internet works and how to ask an AI to do things for them and then there's a big big part uh right now it Sayes 7 hours but I think it's going to be a little more than that where uh we're building an entire software from scratch from the landing page designing a little bit of marketing as well and then everything that involved in assess so private user dashboard uh subscription payment with stripe Lon squeezy sending emails authentic users Etc as well as using AI heavily in order to code really fast I really put my soul out there uh there's a little confession that I've made probably on the internet I hated school I hated how things were taught to me and I really try to teach this course in a way that is simple easy fun with a real outcome a goal that you might want to build your freedom you might want to turn your idea into reality I'm really trying to make this course as engaging as fun as possible so it never feels like you're learning but it feels like you're having fun so maybe I can show you a little demo of what's inside of the course so there are three parts the part you just saw earlier mindsets the fundamentals and your each lessons are breaken down into sections or categories whatever and then each lesson is like a 30 seconds to sometimes one or two minutes long I I really try to break them down into the smallest part possible and because I am a developer after all I need to procrastinate a little bit so I played around and there's like a dark theme a way for people to focus and just be fully locked in into inside of a lesson um well this is me procrastinating here that brings me up to today and why I'm releasing this course now it is about 80% completed I think I need a couple other weeks to finish it fully so I think it was an opportunity for me to launch this course at a cheaper price to reflect the fact that uh there's still some lessons that I need to work on and it's also an opportunity for anyone learning how to code to grab the discounts now that it's cheaper and so you will find under this video a link to the course to see if it's a fit for you and that's how you can grab the Black Friday deal I hope you like it and that you keep shipping 6 years ago I fired the developer in my head in order to become an entrepreneur but I couldn't have done it tone it's because of my friend Andre all right so we are in s South Korea and we met for the first time 6 years ago in a similar area and I was back then I was like 100% thinking about whatever product I'm going to build this is what my matters and you came and you told me something I will always remember sell it before you make it yeah what is the first thing you you what is the actional thing you tell me do that you remember yeah so the actionable thing that I told you at that time was that you should uh pick a niche first of all like an it a niche that is very interesting to you that you feel excited to work with and then go you know scrape some emails from people of that Niche so like maybe you know 10 a day or whatever you feel comfortable sending emails per day and um and then just try to get them to raise their hand and say that they're interested in some type of value proposition that you're offering and then once they raise their hand you try to get them on a call and then you make you make an offer you make a pitch and then from that it's mathematically impossible not to get your first client and start to make money and start to build confidence and then have a service or a product that you're proud of so it's 2018 so people the world does know does not know what Zoom is and I'm following his device I'm sending emails to businesses that I've never seen whatsoever and then I told them to to jump on a zoom call and a few of like most of them like what what is zoom you know like I have no idea what like they don't even reply but a few of them say yes and eventually that's how I end up making my first $1 on the internet and this is crazy it's all everything everything is like everything started with with Andre it's crazy and you can do it too nothing stopping you earlier we were talking about the product first mindset that I had that you helped me like break and go from the entrepreneurship mindset what would you say is the things that developers lack when it comes to entrepreneurship yeah so the product first mindset it it it makes a lot of sense but another way to think about it is um a customer first mindset so the way I think about a customer uh first mindset is you go directly to the customer first right instead of trying to build something and then and try to sell it one to many which is very very difficult you go directly to whatever target market you've identified you talk to one person in that Target Market you identify what their problems are and then you build something specifically for them and now you're in a position to gather those insights get that market data and then build a SAS later or continue down the the service based mindset too that works as well if your goal is to make money as soon as possible which I know a lot of people's goal is just to get some to generate some cash flow then there's no faster way than going directly to somebody and asking them what their problems are solving proposing proposing to solve that problem and then getting money to fix it right that's the fastest way and and then from there you have options you can build a SAS or you can continue down that server space path it's like a hypothesis it exists in your head yeah but like it yeah you're putting a lot of time energy into something that you don't even know somebody will buy so the fastest way to know if if somebody will buy is to go directly to the market ask them yourself and all you lose is a little bit of time yeah making those Cod emails exactly right so that that to me is probably the safest most effective route than trying to build something uh that that you hope people will buy later because those insights are incredibly valuable that you gain from working with someone one-on-one that's how you got fired me up 6 years ago to choose between subscription or onetime payment oh you do onetime payment if like you want to build something and not really like think about it too much yeah right but I think one time payments are good for validating something if if no one buys your One Time payments no one will buy your subscription if no one buys your subscription maybe they'll buy your Ser your service for onetime payments so from a development standpoint I think it's really up to your own priority right like the nice thing about subscription is that you you have this money coming from the same people over and over they become loyal to you and it forces you to continue to build on that one app and develop it so if it's like your one baby and you want to you know take off with it and you want it to be like your one Legacy product then a subscription might make sense because again it just keeps you accountable to continue to force yourself to develop it and improve it Etc but if you just want to ship a bunch of stuff I think a one time payment is probably idea it's a good point I didn't say it this way it's like like almost forcing you to be productive by having subscription that's true it's like a financial accountability you have to the user right it's like they're paying you every month so they expect to see uh more products more updates more a lot of different maybe a community component maybe all these different things but uh that depends on your own priority as of development this is my uh current family knows apartment and this place is magical to me because this is when ship pass idea came from this idea eventually turned on into a million doll business so uh trouble more now I need to turn off these camera before I get deported from Korea for installing equipment on the balcony this is the setup this would be no issue in belly your friends but here you never know

TITLE: How I grew my SaaS to $4,000 MRR with cold emails (developer VLOG)
VIDEO ID: KJb_nfR6gJk
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJb_nfR6gJk
================================================================================

one cold email $4,000 and there was no customer support whatsoever we need one cold that's it and that's the first making money other the balls meet Mark Lou a millionaire who owns exactly zero pairs of shoes and way more startups than You' think is reasonable he sits here in this disgustingly beautiful Tropical Paradise to show you how to turn ideas into trans strangers into clients and your boring job into a distant [Music] memory we finally made it yeah we freaking made it with maybe 6 hours delay but we made it yeah we got the Visa we have a fly ticket we're freaking ready to go to Australia to meet that person meet some we finally arrived Australia it was supposed to be our healing trip but the first day is totally brutal yeah it was crazy hopefully we can get a car rent told now ah Australia what's up that pretty good now it's 400 p.m. we tried to eat dinner before five Mark is actually having a little struggle to disconnect we can talk about it during this dinner yeah e you yeah yeah okay let's do this that looks good so actually this morning we had a little talk no yeah I'm kind of made a mistake today by opening the computer mhm cuz once I start working I kind of stop thinking I have to write about thinking about the tweets I'm going to write build features I have to fix bugs so many things and once I see something then it kind of never stops and it's like infinite treadmill you need to find the SA way to work well but also have a good rest to disconnect from work to have better ideas to do up or and out yeah I think you need to work whatever if you want to make something good mhm but honestly I think you can start with a couple hours like an hour a day I think it's a miraculous amount of time and when you have a constraint and your brain knows it has a limited amount of things those constraints create creativity MH because you know you only have one hour because after you have kids or you have a job now my weakness is that I have so much time because that's my work that I'm getting drawn into it and I'm not creative I'm less happy I burn out it's interesting because when you are Indie hacker people recommend to start side hustle along with your main work to like um risk management of you know yeah and also for that mindset your constraint actually make you like success faster because you don't have a pressure to succeed fast so if you just start don't quit your main job keep it and also use that rest of time wisely to work like a 100% yeah you go full time and your brain starts to have expectation imagine you spend you work 66 hours a day for like a month without taking time off at the end of the month unless you've been doing this for years your brain will expect results it's It's Perfectly Normal yeah so e it's so easy to burn yeah discourage burnout there's my brain that is like how much views are we going to get how much like is this we going to make how much money are we and man this is so stupid because I have not started the journey for that it's addictive I get drwn into that and I don't want to I need to write a plan of all the metrics I want to track making one video per week is something I really care making thoughtful tweets to help people get started building apps I want to keep making apps like I used to I think I'll take a day off a week now mhm I think that's important cuz human beings are not made to sit down and look at the computer for 24/7 I think relationships in this larning journey is very important at the beginning it's pure Faith like you you see sh for month nothing happens and you even start doubting about yourself are you good enough am I good enough mhm when you have someone that you can trust that tells you I trust you you're going to make it this is like a it's a superpower sometimes it's hard to see your value by yourself and you can be the worst enemy telling negative selft talk so that's why outside objective you is important and that emotional support really means a lot yeah should we turn off the camera and enjoy the yeah this is freaking good yeah everybody's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good it never gets easier I 30° outside it wasn't easy that was a mistake but it was very important for the mental health we talked about all to be continued 8:00 a.m. camera is rolling yeah what's your plan bro what's the plan bro um hike in the morning mhm then uh try to find some good food then we are going to see kangaroos because we're in godamn Australia and then we're going to meet that person that special person that special person Chang your life yep 7 years ago W big oh hey it's beautiful wow imagine going all the way down to Australia to eat ital so cute yeah so beautiful we just have a lunch like it was so amazing with the homemade olives and it's always about no it was about having a time off to refresh our mind and then ready to go back to work just ship it to ship it what day have a life in a Solo preneur I don't I don't know if people actually have a clue of what we're talking about but we're going to meet the my first ever customer and I person changed my life and and your life too we went from like doing zero on the internet to making the first dollar with that customers we're going to meet back then I also meet my good you know him too my good friend Andre and he told me like sell it before you make it and I started to color collect emails of escap room businesses across the world that person said yes to the email so we jump on a call and I Tred to sell her like I was in my head I was completely thinking like an engineer so the call is super awkward I recorded the call and I'm like uh you uh I I I I I I built this this tool so um I um um I sent you um a demo of the of and she's so kind and she's like oh okay yeah that's that's sound interesting and she said yes and she spent around in toal I think around3 or $4,000 for the software one call emails one call $4,000 M crazy one of the reason most entrepreneurs never make money is because they build things people don't want and so if you don't ask customers before you're just going to end up spending 3 months building a product that nobody will want cuz we convince oursel oh this is a good idea this is going to work the truth the numbers shows that most of the time nobody wants the product what made you convince persuaded the customers to buy your product I make it sound like a no-brainer I told her this cost this amount of money and if you use it well you're going to get 3x the same amount of money I was I'm really sure of this was ever going to work in the worst case I can refound her if I messed up in my calculation so there's no big deal there's no string attach it's not about the product it's not about your product it's about the outcome for the business when you invest in the marketing tool it's like you expect a return on investment on the call I would use that to explain more how this would work see their objections see where they tell you like ah I'm not sure M so ask questions because you might realize that your product is not a good fit and instead another product could be a good fit and you will be surprised how much people are willing to let you know their struggles what else can I help you with you know is there anything you struggle with that I can make easier for you that is the right mindset I think to have and it's it feels much more genuine to sell something to someone that way that's true so cute I don't know who is the animal here oh the balls he has massive balls are you blind oh sorry are you okay they're all blind look at their eyes they all sleepy what is this kind of food like chalk oh oh so uh bummer the Escapo business was closed today today's Wednesday so we didn't get to see danela the owner of the Escapo business and I didn't get to show you my first customer but uh instead let me show you how I made $4,000 with one Cod email okay so we are early 2018 I have Zer I am doing some gigs for movies to make a couple hundred dollars a month so I can survive I need to make money so what if I help some kind of business I care about get more customers in using a product that I create what if I make puzzles for escape rooms that they can use those puzzles for them to get more customers so I go on yel I type escape room in whatever City I don't care because I'll never go there I'll use the internet to reach them out I pick any escape room then I open their website and here manually I go to the contact page and then I sell them an email this is a real email that would sent um 2018 I personalize every email so for that I use the name of the business owner to do that I go on the yel page and usually in the reviews um sometimes the the business owner would reply to a customer or a customer would mention a staff member that was really helpful I would use that email I explain why I'm reaching out I go straight to the point I'm trying to help escape room businesses increase their booking rate I personalize even more I say I know how much reviews you have on y but I noticed there is something you could do better I put myself as the bridge to get more customers and the C to action is you can pick any slot on my calendar I'm an engineer I feel super uncomfortable and it's somewhere in the middle of 2018 I flew to Japan cheapest flight cheapest guest house I have $0 I have to do a Visa Run and one of those leads decided to jump on a CO with me I wrote a few things back then where why having this marketing tool it would help them uh what they're missing out um I have a little plan on what I'm going to tell them but it's mostly me just awkward trying to to tell them something but surprisingly that person danela from the escape from business we were supposed to visit today uh decide to move forward and says yes I'm happy to get this going and here we go the ball was running I ended up making building the software for her it looks like this so it's on Facebook Messenger it's like a bot where it's automated messages so people customer their customers could go here uh start a little challenge they say oh I want to play the parking spots game and then the messenger bot would challenge them like here um there's was there was a murder in bangalo uh here are three potential suspects which one killed Rose there would be buttons for people to type there are like 10 20 games like this that are built and in the end the customer can get an escape room this is just 5% but you earn a 5% coupon for the escape room this would increase escape room business's conversion rate and just that one call with danela was enough to get one customer she spent I think around $4,000 on the business because she keeps paying for on and off four to 5 years just one cold email this is pretty crazy I would structure my days based on that so in the morning I would do marketing and sales so I would go back to yel Trip Advisor uh find five or 10 escape room businesses basically I would have different stages of pipeline the first one would be uh just the lead itself I haven't sent any email then would be stage number two I sent one email two email three emails and then at the fourth email I would just move on and close it I would automate the email sending so every time an email has been sent on stage two if it wasn't uh replied from the customer it would move on to stage three I would have four templates one per stage to make sure that I'm not missing out any leads and this was 6 years ago and now the business is closed Co basically killed the business here uh 2020 espr business is closed but as you can see it went up to I think four a little bit over 4,000 mother must recurring Revenue which is just excellent for me I was so happy because it was my first dollar on the internet uh the entire business was built on top of cold emails that said that's the only thing I did that worked he made around $770,000 plus I think around $1 to $15,000 on PayPal and this is just me doing cold email for like one year or something and what's even more crazy they have the customers who ended up loving the product so much they spent 13,000 us on this product and there was no customer support whatsoever we did one call that's it that's why I think Cod emails for any B2B businesses are really really underrated and should definitely dig somewhere here I also learned how marketing because I am a developer and it felt so awkward to sell something and some people say like sorry I cannot afford it right now and I realize this means that she does not see the value in the product but of course she can afford it if there is the value all those learnings from C emails and calls which are very hard to do are very Foundation of marketing that's why I really recommend start with a random business idea just pick something that exists already where you see money is already flowing find a way to make it yours add your signature me it was adding little games make turning the like marketing things into a gamification tool you might not build the exact business you have in mind right now but you're going to end up making something people actually want and that's the first step into making money on the internet how was the workout holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you scared the of me I just came back from kangaroo lens and I have so much work to done so now it's time to look in this is happening um YouTube sent me a little message the say it's time to celebrate I'm going to redeem this little thing right here it's so fun because I still watch a lot of YouTube videos and whenever I see a Creator showing these in the background I'm like a that would be amazing to have this in my room but it's impossible and it isn't it's it's real uh I'm going to show you the process how that goes okay so they gave me this little uh code here and I can redeem the award I have no idea what's next there we go this is the thing that's going to be in the room in the background oh I can input any name here okay that's going to be displayed right here approve and check out and there we go it's shipping to friends it's taking about to 3 weeks and I think we should be around friends in a month so uh yeah prepare the unboxing in the next videos I am trying to grow this software data fast to $1 million uh now what I mean $1 million it's the valuation so if we uh take a four multiple which is a generous multiple for software uh we take the monthly recording Revenue so 21,000 in monthly recing Revenue uh annualized on 12 month that's about a quar a million dollar times 4 that a million dollar valuation uh now I'm far from there this is the actual monthly recing Revenue 642 in Mr um which is not bad for a software that is about a month or two old but we're far from the 1 million in valuation so what I did recently is I asked on Twitter Hey if you visited the site but you didn't sign up why and surprisingly I get so much good valuable information uh there was this one from Kites that says I'm not sure if it's worth the hustle to migrate all my data to your software and so what I'm doing now is I really want to focus on building features that help people grow their startup with data actionable data that tells you exactly how to grow your startup data FAS knows what your site is all about and it also knows analytics my goal now is to build the right features to help customers grow their business so the new feature I built recently and I'm super excited about is the customer Journey it basically gets all the customers and check everything they've done before signing up uh for this person uh tomaya I can can see that this person found uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fast on X I can see what the person did so they visited the site two time and then they purchased and I can look at for different customers for instance um this one I can see what they did on on November 1st I can see what they did after they even uh sent me an email and then finally they ended up paying this is just the beginning it's a very early version but basically is going to track any goal that the user has in mind until the entire Journey from the moment the person visited the site to the moment they completed the goal and as a little hint I'm going to use that later to give some actionable insight another things I did which is also really useful is when I get events from stripe called the web hook events um stripe tells me for instance a customer check out but fail or or customer just cancel their subscription and so I built lots of little robots on my site that listens for those events and send emails to try to understand why the customer performed this action for instance I set up this email here that says um I noticed you just cancel your data fast subscription so right after they cancel your feedback could help me improve data fast if you tell me just why you cancel I'm just curious and now I'm getting pretty decent replies um I think what the person means here is that he doesn't see the value in the software yet so back to the initial problem but uh it's good to collect feedback and know exactly why people take the time to visit my landing page and not sign up look at this big musle what kind of YouTube channel is not Fant shoe it's a fitness channel oh man it feels so good to be back Australia was so good but the routine we have at home nothing better than that and you know what what logo fast the free logo M maker I built one year ago guess how much revenue you made 1,000 it's a free tool it's a free tool yeah oh 3,000 in total you made I need a to take me home I can't see is where my house gone think about you all the time and I just can't see to make you now

TITLE: He hacked my site... so I paid him $300

================================================================================

so a random guy hacked my site and he let me know by email I sent him $300 to thank him but not a good looking day today well so we missed the flight it's [Music] real I don't even know where to starts happy birthday to you happy I have all the the zinc on my face oh man this is the most Bell F French belly gift you could ever make Blow the candle and make a wishes what is your wish I think I just wish us good health and peacefulness I'm a you like a lion after eating laa it's a voice like happy birthday to you Surfer surfing h I am so excited because my portfolio of software is about to reach $10,000 per month so that include all the little startups here except chipas which is not a software and I'm so happy because uh I I'm doing it breaking the two fundamental rules of Entrepreneurship the first one is about Focus you can hear everywhere that entrepreneurship is about focus focus focus it just doesn't work like this for me in my brain I like to jump between different kinds of projects startup a on Monday startup B on Tuesday that just something that I really like and the good part about it is that I don't I cannot I cannot be a perfectionist I cannot focus on tiny little details I have to go straight to the essential because my time is limited and that forces me to build only what matters for customers which I think is a great framework for being productive and at the same time I'm also very happy because um this portfolio is about to make $10,000 and 90% is coming from one time pay payments except data fast which is brand new and also habit Garden which is my first startup the rest is coming from onetime payment so 90% of the 10K per month is coming from onetime payments one of the most common advice you hear out there is to have a subscription for your software I wrote and news later explaining why onetime payment is much better especially when you're getting started um you will see that you can actually make more money with one time payment because it's easier to sell uh it's free it's on internet if you want add a link in into the description I really recommend you to have a look and if you want to dive deeper into pricing because pricing is marketing and pricing is very important I made a video recently about five pricing mistakes I made it's on my YouTube check it out it's not a good looking day today why uh I think I got um so I'm getting at the moment I'm getting roasted on Twitter and look at that those are all all people trying credit card on my sites so they can screw whatever they can screw and for another business of mine just people just vote the app and then they start to dispute the payments it has 0.3% dispute activity there was like since this account exists there's been no dispute for a year she I don't even know where to starts so um haven't been working much on the product recently because um there hundreds of people thousands of people trying to attack my site my emails are full of spam my phone is full of messages from my good friends that ask if I'm okay I don't even know if I'm fuing okay and I just I just want to make startups on the internet God damn it okay so just a little bit of context two years ago I had Zer so I just focused on shipping really fast making apps really fast so I can get results fast I was just literally focusing on not being broke and then um that's that's that's how I ended up making all those websites here in the past two or 3 years and that's also how one of my startups took off so this here this thing here um is how I made more money than I thought I would ever make and at the same time I started to grow a following on Twitter and my audience went from zero followers 3 years ago to uh whatever this is now as well as growing a little following on YouTube and in my head I was still thinking like the same Mark I was 2 years ago where I was in stress mode and I had to ship really fast and so I did not change my behavior I kept shipping the same way I used to and then someday I saw this post on Twitter from Matt where he says that we should write test for our Co we should build uh secure apps and um he found a way to bypass the pay wall on one of my startup the post was made in the building public Community which which is a community of um this is the community I grew up with like a three years ago um some people there became my friends like real friends we see in real life and it's it's a beautiful Community because entrepreneur is really hard and this is a place where we help each other and usually when one of us makes a mistake we would send a DM privately to each other and try to fix it and when I saw this was made um it was nicely made it was ethical M did Mt did not disclose anything here but the fact that it was public I didn't know how to react because I thought just a DM could have done the same work without the harm so at this moment I just did not reply and then a couple days weeks later um Matt found another bug in one of my products and at the same time I I received this email from a student called Jonas and he found the exact same bug but the difference is that Jonas sent me this bug report through a private email and to thank him for uh the time he took to write the email I sent him $300 and I I wanted to show that uh there might be another way to report bugs and if it's done privately I'm even happy to pay the people who report the bugs so I made a tweet taking about the story so he hacked my site and I paid him $300 and then I talk about the story of you know everything that that happened and I think um I try to have like a little nudge in the end to praise in public and criticize in private uh these tweets went pretty viral and I think that was the the start of uh something bigger it really created a movement where on one side you would have people who have the same mindset as me that think bug should be reporting in private and on the other side um there were developers who think um apps should be shipped with more secure infrastructure and since the Twitter algorithm is always made for a good drama they started to be like a flood of post of people who disagreed on which what is the right way to do things and very soon I would see lots of post on my Newsfeed like dozens of post a day of people trying to find vulnerabilities on my site and posting uh ethically again uh what they found without disclosing how to reproduce but they would post publicly what happened in that Community those spot was usually got viral and I would get I would see like in in a very quick way I would see like hundreds of post in a similar fashion and since it became big like I I would receive like hundreds of of people trying to hack my site to find something to share on Twitter um then my server will go down or we'll just find lots of bug like robots I think it spreaded outside of our community and some people with bad intention from outside the community started to join this and try to hack my site but like in a in a in a filthy way and it would go as far as paying for app and instantly charging back pretending they didn't pay in order for uh well me to lose money and I think to prove a point and at this moment I was I was honest I felt attacked I really felt attacked um so I made a post which I think put it more oil on the fire and I also posted this uh this line here which I'm mindly proud of uh but I I got emotional so I started to block people on Twitter um I've never blocked anyone in 3 years I'm usually the labrador type of personality uh but I felt like it was too much for me to handle and I wanted to just close the computer and and not see that anymore but this didn't help in any way and he just added more oil on the fire so it would be more people trying to hike my site more people posting vulnerabilities on Twitter and and it was not easing the thing so I decided to cool down um turn off my brain and of course this did not make things better attacks keep going stronger and stronger and so at some point as I just made a video to explain the situation and apologize for my emotional reaction so this was an intense week but also a full of learnings and knowledge so there are two things I learned the first one is that shipping fast is important but shipping fast does not mean shipping irresponsibly especially now that I have the following so my my uh apps get way more users and more awareness in security is important leaking data or critical bugs are just not okay and I'm very grateful for all the people who reported these bugs so I taken all the tweets and I went through the code base of all of my startups to make sure that this never happens again and I also hired someone to help me secure all my ads and my second learning is more about communication where I could have avoided the situation if when I saw the first tweet I would have just replied neutrally to it I should have never reacted emotionally I should have never blocked people I should have used the feedback in order to improve my product I should have opened the conversation and I'm very grateful for the burg reports good morning we just woke up and three more people to go wow it's such a big deal it's crazy how do you feel you honestly it feels unreal because I've never intended to grow an audience on YouTube it's mostly just me sharing what I do M and honestly he really feels unreal so if you have someone who just start YouTube what would be the advice for someone who just start to find the identity and I think in the end is about trying to try to make try to make stuff not for YouTube but try to make stuff that inspire people just stuff that if it's not YouTube if it's not Twitter if it's not Instagram you could show that to someone in the street you'll be like well that's cool and because I have all my eight businesses to run Twitter and and a bunch of other stuff I cannot spend much time on YouTube literally I spend maximum one day per week on YouTube so how did limitation help you actually it's because I was limited that I I got here it's like it forced me in 24 hours to do something like this this little constraint like you have a 24 hours window do whatever but you have to show something in the end so the the the audio quality was bad the video quality was bad like everything was bad but I built the habit and then nothing happened for 3 months literally nothing and then I remember I made one of those video that took off like YouTube decided to push it and some of my previous videos were pushed as well like I think two or three of my other previous videos were pushed as well and within a month I would go from a TH or like I don't know yeah a th000 or maybe 5,000 to like 15,000 like it would like triple or or 10x or something I don't remember exactly but like boom one more person I think one thing that really helped see the outcome of your work as a collection of something not as the result don't see don't don't look at the number of followers don't look at the money just look at how many you've done if you make 30 videos and no one watched them you've made 30 videos this is 30 videos like I made 24 25 27 maybe now websites maybe they're on only eight that makes money maybe only one really makes money but still I made 27 websites it's me it's like it's my little collection right I'm so proud this will never go away it's like it's new identity it's now it's deep in my DNA it will never run away oh Noone subcribe oh no this this is literally What It Takes I skipped the surf session this morning because I want to see this and I cannot start a day without surfing so this is extremely extremely important this is a gift from my sister and her boyfriend it says 100K followers like this one it happened it's real it's real yes I guess it's time to thank you for watching my videos I I you know you never I'm talking to a camera at the moment it doesn't feel like it's a person but there's hundred thousands of you who enjoyed at some point my videos and Beyond grateful so well thank you thank you so much I hope I don't even know what to say I just thank you that's all I want I want to say thank you for these I do a I do 15 push-ups in whatever know pullup push-up yeah 15 pull-ups and 15 chinups and then a couple of maybe 60 push-ups then I go to the beach it's my favorite song We're supposed to go to Australia but after this crazy week just to take some time off we realized we need a visa and we didn't have one so we missed a flight we applied for a new Visa we're still waiting you're stay waiting looking at flights and and it's crazy because we're supposed to meet someone in Australia a person that changed my life completely and I don't even know if we could get there a

================================================================================

backpack this little backpack has eight tiny businesses very small businesses but we can move there anywhere we want are you ready let itce focus is overrated he almost guaranteed to make money wow hello the family just hello so where are we going now we're going to n p uhhuh um my parents decided to visit us in Bali for a couple days wow nice so we're moving the startup office somewhere else to a little Paradise Island it's like 40 minutes away from B it's a little it's actually a pretty big island we have this like very famous place where there's a cliff that looks like a dinosaur and uh you can go down the beach you can have fun it's beautiful they're going to visit that part wow look [Music] you so I'm uh I'm working on this new software I launched it a week ago it's called Data fast and it already has 300 in monthly recurring Revenue as well as 133% of turn rate which is not really good so what I'm doing is I I get each customer's email and I ask them personally with my Gmail account why you stop your membership what is the one feature that's missing in the product that way I hope I'll collect good feedback to make to build a better product as well at eventually new startup ideas honestly it's the boring side of things business owners don't really talk about but I think this has lots of value when you start talking to your customers they see the email of the person who created the product they used and they are usually providing really good feedback and I believe if I keep listening to them eventually I'll land on a million dooll software a day in the life of a solo partner wow this is the dad and this is Mom right here if you ever come to Budd this is a absolutely crazy hike the final step if we're making it to the beach like I think focus is overrated I think I've focused two times in my life and every time I burned out because when you focus on something you put on the time you put on the work you have expectations and then after 3 months if you have no results you just burn out so I never focus on any product unless there's a clear Market feed then I spend all my time on it because I know there's a proof which was a case for chipas on the other side if you don't focus on something and you keep building little bricks here and there you have less expectation for one product and then your head is you zoom out from the product and instead of like making Indie page the perfect link bio for entrepreneurs by adding more features more features more features I'm more like yeah let's tweet about this and tweet about that and then I try new stuff short stuff and then suddenly I didn't have no expectation that it would become a backlink Marketplace it's an interesting conversation so yeah yeah I love I love this conversation people ask you what is the standard of like uh choosing good startup best startup so that people can like uh drop out the best project fast and then move on you know but in the beginning in the page looked like oh this a p obviously you shouldn't really focus for a long time and you should move on but like a late bloomer suddenly people it kind of like a discover the new market by itself and people suddenly find their like own solution from there so it's about timing you know I don't I don't think I think in this Cas in Chast timing is mattered but in this case I don't think timing matters it's more about having my head I Shi the side project it's not a clear here go like no nothing crazy happens I don't ditch it but I don't focus on it I'm working on other products I looking at what's happening in the revenue I looking at what people say I looking at the customer support and then something sometimes at a random moments something clicks like it was the case for the backlinks and then I have so many like man this is this is the same thing for all of my projects even the SEO project I made I shipped like a two month two two years ago like little SEO project and then I moved on and then from time to time I add one page for ranking and then slowly slowly slowly it starts to grow and then after years you start to see things feedback from people like whatever something happens and that is this is just what happening with with indepent so the important thing is don't put the too much High expectation on your actions and then keep it running and eventually and one of the seeds will grow like later exactly it's like planting seeds so that's why sometimes they will just fade and then nothing will happen soil is not good and sometime they will grow very late and sometime they will grow because of another seed you planted later will make it grow and then it feeds by itself on the fairy back home I was checking my phone some YouTube comments and I see this question popping all the time about how to find startup ideas and now it's kind of easy for me to find startup ideas because I have like built 25 websites so problems happen all the times and when there's a problem there's a solution there's a great startup idea but the thing is when I got started I had zero business idea that I could build because I had no problems and I was looking for this creative idea that would be promising and eventually makes money but I I couldn't come up with any but I found the easiest way to come up with an idea that is almost guaranteed to make money there are already existing markets there are existing problems and there are existing solutions for those problems people are already paying for that so the money is already flowing there is no need to come up with a new creative idea sometimes the easiest way is to just replicate something that is already working and make your own version out of it my my 25th startup data FAS is just web analytics nothing special but the market is here people are already paying for these kind of tools so if if you're if you're if you're just getting started and you're looking for an idea to build could be an existing problem find something find something where people are already paying money for and make your own version of what you think the solution should be add your touch add your signature make it playful make it super easy to use add some some stuff that were not there already but make sure you focus on a problem that exists already and that people are already paying for it that makes me think I have tons of work to finish before the week ends and so it's time to go back to work I mean I think this is terrible and it it's applied from anything from lifestyle to business there people who don't want to change and then they feel bad when someone is trying to do a different way I don't like to wear clothes so being topless is weird or I'm learning how to code and there is this software engineer who's been here in the industry for 10 years he telling me you have to use this framework yeah I'm like yeah but this one looks like much no you have to use this like this's this this really sense of like this is the way things should be done and if you don't do that then you're wrong and when you're getting started you don't you have you don't have a confidence so you don't question that and if you do you still feel bad because in the end you you don't have foundation so you're not sure and you easily lose your confidence which is everything at the beginning when you start you need the confidence right cuz that's that's how you keep going where working from home sleeping 9 hours at night I would never believe it because I believed what I saw on social media and somehow by finding this little success and success and success I starting to follow my own way and I realize everything I've seen maybe it works for some others but it doesn't work for me and I wish I knew that earlier so I didn't have to pretend play the game that they've you know set up mhm and that goes for again like uh whatever whether it's like daily habits about sleep and not working too hard or it's about using these special new framework that the JavaScript engineer should all be using it's all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man yeah sometimes I wish I would be back in time and and see 21 years old Mark and just tell him come on bro just keep doing what you're doing like don't try to change don't try to please someone don't try to follow someone just keep doing your own way if you have this stupid idea follow it if you don't want to wear t-shirt don't wear t-shirts and who cares who says what he's a good man so my parents are visiting us in Bali and uh since they've been hosting me for 20 years of their life I want to kind of give back and we inviting them to beautiful restaurants hello very beautiful I think I can eat this make a wish what is your wish finished that $1 million I just came back from a delicious lunch with my parents and um I was surprised because my mind was some sometimes thinking about work problems always happen like all the time there are problems at the beginning there are problems when you start to make money there are problem when you make more money I think learning how to deal with problems is very it's it's a very important skill to master if you don't want this like entrepreneur ship thing eating every part of your life that's something I I wish I knew when I started the journey I so I I hope that's a little helpful here um and at the same time one of my other business is making is on track to make $10,000 this month this is crazy because it's running 100% on autopilot it's still early but I will keep you posted in the next video fa cheers

================================================================================

[Applause] [Music] what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is I'm getting a bug that is extremely weird uhhuh and within the last 2 minutes uhhuh we made $400 what yeah I don't know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on here we made a 400 buck yeah two customers uhh they both like a very similar time frame uhhuh so this you know there a mix of like punch you in the face and like go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself like deal you with your bug and at the same times there a liter Universe sending me another message like let me give you 400 bucks oh wow but still [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know I have a bug and I have no clue how to fix it wow that's a nice dish for what the this happens all the time I always blame whatever like I told you like it's a random error I don't know what's going on and Etc then I realize it's it's your fault it's my fault what did you what did you miss it's always the developer fault remember I was making a thumbnail for YouTube video a couple days ago and I put some codes where I kind of reveal API Keys which is secret Keys you're not supposed to reveal that API Keys AP ke and and for that I faked a I created fake API key inside of the project why so I can fake it no so I can fake it so I can make screenshots of fake API keys but the problem is I forget that I saved the file so now my my computer was reading these fake API keys that don't exist so of course he was telling me like hey I cannot connect oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that was fast I'm I'm literally about to launch data fast it's been three months I'm working on that startup um what I'm doing here is I'm testing the happy flow I'm logging with a new browser erase the cookies try a new email address and pretend I'm a new user try everything from visiting the landing page to using the product to being able to pay make sure the happy path is working um once I'm done with that I'm going to press play actually launch that startup I'm not going to lie I'm a bit stressed about it um let's go okay so this is not yet posted on the internet but this is a launch tweet and uh when I click here I officially launch this thre Monon old project [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the Tweet is live oh my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it never gets easier it be three years launching 24 websites and I always have this stress whenever I launch I didn't add oh my boy and I don't remember if maybe I it's a website analytic tool and maybe I don't even track my own data oh no okay I'm tracking oh boy okay I I will turn on the camera again if something happens for now it's going to be uh just me overthinking again but at least it's public it's live it's launched I launched it it's been just 1 hour since I launched and there's there's 14 days of free TR so people cannot pay at the moment I got maybe 20 25 signups and two people already secur the launch deal and input their credit cards so the subscription and they are two active subscription this is maybe the road to the first $1 in monthly recuring Revenue with this product let's go that's why [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I see lots of uh advice for productivity out there and uh most of it I think is really toxic about work hard work hard work hard I've tried that in the past trying to work as much as I can setting up alarms so I can work earlier sometimes neglecting workouts and the only time I burn out like the two times I burn out in my life were times where I neglected sleep and I was not in shape I was not working out every day when I restarted the the Journey 3 years ago I remember made making three rules for myself to make sure that I never burn out again and it's been like a thousand days almost and I've been working every day without taking any holiday and I I always feel great whether it's for work or whether it's my life with with a wife there's no no sense of burnout and I work way less than I used to and I'm way more productive I think working hard Works only if you don't neglect the three important part which are diet sleep and workout and mine is very simple I go to bed at the same time every single day no matter what and make sure I have 8 to 9 hours of sleep and then clean food most of the time and uh not eating too late not eating too much to make sure I don't destroy my sleep and work out every single day no matter what cuz that's the way I tame the little box up there that's how I'm more focused that's how I'm more productive that's how I sleep better and the next days are even easier and I think I work from 10 or 11:00 a.m. until maximum 6:00 p.m. which is pretty decent day but nothing crazy and I'm able to do that every day without sacrificing what matters the most which means having a beautiful Lifetime with with a wife being healthy being happy not being stressed and and really it's all thanks to those three things workout diet and sleep I launched datas my 25th software yesterday and I just got to see the number after a good night of sleep and I was really not expecting any of this to be honest I was really pessimistic about the launch and every time I launch a new product the couple days before the actual launch date I always feel like this is not going to work and sometimes it's the case and sometimes like today it's very surprising I'm going to show you the numbers but just the takeaway and it's always the same but you never know until you actually launch so launch that thing now let me show you some of the numbers Okay so yesterday I made this tweet it's poly written um again the product is a beta of a beta of a beta it's a big product I really launched an early version and um man this like I would never expect to get this much likes and especially the number of comments which show that if you look at the comments it's very positive yeah the overall comments are really positive so that this really shows there's something going on um the numbers are actually great so this now I can use data fast to uh track the data that are happening on my site uh this is data fast you can see the spike coming from the launch uh 5.8 th000 visitors with one tweet this is crazy so now we can look a little bit deeper at what happens exactly so this is the data for just today I'm going to check the last 24 hours so that's a big spike of traffic and that's crazy X or Twitter brought four over 4,000 visitors it's insane um here there are 468 people who went to the signing page that's less than 10% coming from the homepage so here it's telling me that is this is bad this is pretty bad 10 less than 10% interest from click to from visitors to sign up I think this could be really improved uh there's some really potential here to improve it's it's very interesting that H almost the same amount of people are visiting the affiliate page as the one signing for the product so half of the people are here for the actual product which is the reason they click but half of them are also coming for the affiliate program this is this is interesting data and then again from signing to dashboard there's about 30% of people who did not sign up and then half of them did not even create try to create a website W the funnel here is pretty bad um I'm I'm pretty happy with the launch I I I was excited about it because you'll see why later when we come to Revenue data um but it's very interesting to see that the the top of the funnel is actually pretty bad uh let's have a look now at um so this is tripe so of course the product made 0 because because there is a 14 days of free travel but what I do is I let people input their credit card details I charge them the zero until the end of the free trial the 14 days of free trial but by inputting the credit card details they're guarant guaranteed to secure the launch deal because I I cheap with the cheaper price and as I input more features the price will go up in the future and so that nudges people to input their credit card at the moment so they will be grandfather they will keep that launch deal forever and if you look at this those are uh all those are all the people who created an account and input their credit card details to secure the launch deal and they are I think 19 people 19 C 19 potential customers who have an active subscription which is going to start in 14 days most of them are on the 10K plan so that's a $9 a month plan and there are some of them on the 100,000 page views a month which is $19 at the moment I'm recording this video so this data is great the top of the phunnel lots of visitors very few sign up but among the people who sign up which is like somewhere around 150 20 almost 20 of them decided to give the credit card details to secure the launch deal this is really good and on top of that um I checked I bu this little um whatever feedback board for the product where only people who logged in and and have a subscription can submit stuff and I'm already collecting feedback from people so click tracking track events I think um yeah there is something here where uh literally tracking like events um on the website like custom goals like who signs up um and eventually making a funnel out of that I think it's this is the number one feature I'm going to work on after I'm done fixing all the little bugs I've seen and but this is great like this this is the day number one launching this product that's much better than I expected I'm collecting feedback it's going to take a while to get this product to a decent monthly recurring Revenue but I'm positive now I'm positive that it might make more than $100 a month and uh and that's beautiful all right so for today it's mostly there's no plans like I have a lot of like tiny little tasks here and there I'm going to check emails see if I get bugs reports from beta testers um since there have been a lot of people testing V app I was sleeping I expected to have broken at some point so today it's was it's going to be a day just like eating bugs for breakfast this is crazy too this is absolutely crazy so I launched yesterday and within 24 hours the ranking of that new website it's a brand new website no one owned it before it jumped from 0 to 23 that is just crazy and that is at this point it's an unfair Advantage cuz I would never be able to do that but because I built 20 plus websites in the past all of them have a little bit of like domain reputation and so whenever I launch a new startup I add this new domain to the previous domains I owned and it tells Google that the new domain I'm launching is trust trustworthy and so Google will start pushing it up right away and within a couple hours now if I type data fast the name of my new startup Google will rank in first place this is this is really crazy crazy so what I do usually is this this is for instance this is one of my websites and then at the bottom in the footer I had right here the new website and these are all of my other websites so that Google's trust these websites and then he's going to trust the new website that I just that I just created I think when you're getting started it makes sense to have a free project where you research some keywords on Google so you know where to rank like a I don't like a hobby project something you're passionate about that step by step month after month is going to start building a tiny reputation and then later when you launch a new startup you can always add your site to that previous site and you never start again from zero and uh actually I created this art this blog article is 100% free it's how do you get customers with programmatic SEO it's basically how do you create websites that rank on Google using SEO this is for instance an website I built and I I don't touch this website and over time it gets more impression more clicks so Google increase the domain rating and then I can use that website to rank my new websites if you want the article it's it's literally in my blog it's Mark marlb have.com this is where I share everything I've learned in the journey and definitely recommend these kind of like fun hobby projects to get started at the beginning all right about to wrap for today so the 24 hours recap for the launch is 6,000 visitors around 200 signups and 21 people who input their credit card details which I believe is great uh need to fix the top of the funnel I spent most of the day fixing bugs and also replying to customer support because well the app is new it's only be tested by me and three friends so there are some stuff that are not intuitive so people ask questions about how to do this um is it how that should work etc I think tomorrow will be another bug fixing day but now it's 6:30 p.m. I really have to log off because I need to wind down otherwise my brain never stops and I really want to have good sleep that's how I'm going to be able to be productive tomorrow so I'm going to turn off this computer go back see my wife have a little walk maybe outside in the dark alone and uh ready to crush it tomorrow that's all there is to it hey so what did you do you say you make websites yeah okay and you freelance and you work from buy yes okay and you said you started from zero yeah and now how much you're making a month I make like around like 4K this month $4,000 a month yeah that's pretty good buddy it's happening for real so oh yeah for now there is$ in Revenue but if we scroll to the monthly recuring Revenue there it is234 monthly recuring Revenue this this is uh this is just 2 days after the launch and uh there's a 14 days of free trial so people cannot pay for the product but they can inut their credit card so they start their subscription right after the free trial and stri calculate that as monthly recing Revenue already so within 12 day I think this monthly recing Revenue will be converted into actual revenue and there we go just like this the first step of making $1 in monthly recing revenue is completed still a long way to go until I reach a million dollar in valuation but that's that's a that's a little step already so now this is what I am doing in order to hopefully grow this product first I set up a feed back board so this is a little um something I built where only people who are authenticated to my product can submit features and then they are ranked here from the Most Wanted feature at the top to the least wanted feature what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go over each feature step by step the first one the Most Wanted feature first build it ship it let people know that I have shipped that feature and hope that by making a better product uh my people will maybe spread the word love the product and stay for for longer another thing I did and I wish I did that earlier it hurt a lot but it works so well is to ask people blun feedback so I made this tweet a little recap of what happened after the launch and here I asked if you visited the site but did not sign up why be blunt please and this brought so many replies 114 replies and each of them is a masterpiece all of them really really hurts but each of them is a little Pebble to build a successful software so what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to get read these over and over until I understand exactly why people did not sign up why people did not purchase and uh that's it that's the whole marketing strategy I hope I'll find the right problem the right objections until I clicks with the audience and hopefully build a product and hopefully reach that 1 million in valuation now it's same to grind time for no man life is two step dancing with theil trying not to lose my balance but God bless the K now I would say the most important so how was the launch um man you know the numbers is good very happy I think we have around 25 happy users 25 yeah already yeah well that's nice yeah I didn't check today so maybe a little bit more than that so you told me you're going to grow it to 1 million set long journey to go but how we going to actually do it how we going to grow it I mean uh okay so now we around two or 300 in monthly recing Revenue uhhuh 1 million SS is like uh I think 25,000 in monthly recording Revenue okay so that's I kind of have to like add two or zero to that yeah okay I I asked people on Twitter why they don't they sign why they visit the site but why they didn't sign up and I I learned something very interesting yeah so when I asked this question people said I don't understand why I would switch to this new product okay I I realized we ship fast and then my mind forg it yeah and then now I'm launching and I I I didn't pay attention to that yeah I have to find the right angle the right marketing angle what kind ofle see when I launched it fast uh there were already tons of boiler plates out there the thing is shias stood out like there was there was like this boom effect and people are like oh yeah that's night and people spread the world and yet shias is just another Boer plate mhm I think what worked is because I had a really totally new marketing approach like a totally new marketing angle it was not just it was not just a code base to do XYZ it was a tool for you to stop overthinking true and the fact that I branded it with a very emotional thing mhm I think that's the reason to off the reason they visit the site but they don't sign up is because my tool is just another tool it has nothing special it's just analytics it's boring and plus that I am a tiny little company it's just me why would you you know why would you migrate all your data to my software true this is where marketing angle angle come from this is where I have to give people a clear reason why they would sign up something that makes my site very special so that instead of comparing my tool with other tools the my tool would just be a different market like it's like there's no way to compare it with others because it's not like the others so how we going to differentiate you know I cannot say that okay okay we continue but that's a good point but I think it's something to remember for every product that I launch something that anyone who is launching a product should think about why is it different why is it special why someone would share this to their friends is it worth sharing and I think if you can answer that in a single sentence you're onto something M so is it like about more marketing find the angle like oh that's different or you have to really also build the features that is very different man I I I am a strong believer that if you package it in a way that's difference even though the product is not fully ready mhm you're doing a good service for people because you show that maybe there is a solution out there for them and so you can afford to make a product that's not perfect at the beginning it's it's okay because it's finally someone who like oh this guy he has a solution for me if I just make another Analytics tool then what is it like I'm a I'm another funer like there's no I'm making just I'm making people lose their time now if I brand it which I'm going to do I'm going to Rebrand it towards a new thing a new kind of marketing a new kind of analytics then it's worth people time yeah and then if I keep investing my time and I deliver on the promise I'll make hopefully that's the road to this 1 million software even though you don't know the angle fully you can just test in the market early so actually you will get the angle from people not by yourself that is it man oh yeah this is exact perfect Market fit so yeah good question the person behind the camera is an AI hello I'm an AI assistant AI girlfriend that's the new kind of tool no that's the this video I want you watching to think why is your product different and make your entire Ling page could be around that until the next one I hope you keep completely control

TITLE: I made $63,247 in September | Solopreneur Diary
VIDEO ID: LRMTfhUM81I

================================================================================

[Music] this is a crazy story today is day 1,49 building startups in public and uh since I made my first tweet on almost 3 years ago I have built 24 websites and made a million dollar and started this YouTube series where I share everything I do so you don't make the same mistakes as me so here is my solo prary diary for 2024 this is a habit tracker I built two years ago and sold it a year ago for $10,000 because I was running out of money and just 2 weeks ago I got it back for free this is a crazy story but before I tell you what happened let me show you why this habit tracker is special so the app will give you daily missions where for instance it tells me that I have to read today then once you have completed your reading habit you can finish the quest and then you will get some rewards like experience points and gems and then you have a little garden where you can grow flowers with the gems you just earned you can plant any sorts of flowers and you can grow them as you're consistent with your habits and on top of that there is a social part where you can play against or with your friends see how consistent they are see their activity Etc I built this app 2 years ago it was my first project with a pay wall at first it was just a simple web application and I launched it with this video boom and we're live thanks for doing this man I appreciate it Hey Joe thanks for having me I was looking forward to this podcast and that video people enjoy those videos that's why I grow a little following on Twitter and one of the most requested feature was Mark we need a mobile apps but the thing is I have no clue how to build mobile application I am a web developer after all so I reached out to my friend Martin and he showed me this new thing called capacitor it's basically like a web view that lets you input any HTML and CSS files inside and ship it as an iOS and an Android app and from zero to having an app published on the App Store and Android store without learning anything it took 14 days it was around January 2023 back then the app was making a couple $100 a month and it wasn't enough to pay my bills I was running out of money and in August 20123 someone made me an [Applause] offer Ron offered to buy habits Garden for $110,000 that was enough money to pay my bill so I accepted and I sold my little baby I announced the acquisition on Twitter I was pretty happy and reliev for the money but I was also a little bit sad because well that was that was the the product that I've been working on for the past 6 months so I was also a little sad it was a year ago and fast forward to a couple weeks ago I was curious about how the new buyer is doing with a new startup so I just sent an email asking how is it going with the startup I had zero expectation from this email just genuine curiosity and the buyer replied we don't have the bandwidth to work on habits Garden we can give it back to you for free man are you kidding me I got my habit tracker back my little baby I was so excited and now that I'm not running out of money like before I can plan and carefully make my moves so I'm trying three things the first one is that I am shipping new features last week I shipped a new flower for the habits Garden the Hein that unlocks randomly when you complete quests and as always with capacitor it takes just a day or something to for the app to be approved on the app stores and my friend Martin is still here to help me when I'm stuck with the app storees release second I'm trying a new pricing it used to be a monthly or a yearly subscription now I'm trying a $5 a month subscription or a $50 lifetime deal you pay once you access forever the pay wall looks like like this this and now people have the option between a monthly or a lifetime deal payment and so far there has been a couple of customers and all of them chose to go with a lifetime deal even though it's 10 times more expensive I'm making a video about pricing for software and apps and mistakes I made in the past that kept my startups from making money and I'm going to release that on my channel in a couple of weeks you can subscribe to make sure you don't miss out and finally number three I am testing user generated content in Instagram reals Tik toks shorts I think this is where the audience for the Habit tracker is and since I am a boring 30 years old adult I don't watch any of those short form videos I asked my good friend Jack freaks if he can help with this and so he's making content all by himself one short form video per day and within 7 days he had a viral Banger this is the Instagram account he created it was Zero followers a couple days ago and it's all because Jack has been super super consistent and thanks to that he got the V the first viral Banger 3 million views for a new Instagram account that brought a hundred of users to Habit garden and it's absolutely amazing make sure to follow this guy Jack freaks on Twitter he knows what he's doing he's doing the exact same thing for one of his mobile app and that's how he's getting thousands and thousands of users and I'm I'm tired of sitting all day long feels much better there's a a good friend of mine in Bal who told me to visit this place in the north part of Bal called munduk so my wife and I took a three days trip there I brought my uh my computer and uh we went to that beautiful Villa and it was absolutely amazing we would work on the daytime and unlike here where I live in the south part of belly where it's super hot outside so I'm mostly indoor with that AC thing all the time otherwise I'm sweaty everywhere and uh the brain is not working in munduk the the weather is much more chill so you can actually work outside and at the same time my wife and I would do our daily morning workout cook a little bit travel a little bit and enjoy a good time and then I received a text message from someone I admire Peter Lao asked me if I was in Singapore and uh I was done in Singapore but of course I bought a ticket to Singapore the man is giving a conference at the network state in Singapore and it was an opportunity for me to meet him for the first time so we flew there right away with my wife brought the computer put on some hours of work in the plane and attended to the conference the conference is called the network States if you haven't heard of it it's by the guy named Balaji um and I was actually very impressed by what they're doing they are building an entire ecosystem for new types of society so digital Nomad with their computers can go there I think it's $11,000 a month for a room with roommates or $2,000 a month for your own room it's built on an island in between Singapore and Malaysia they provide good food they provide co-working space with AC they provide a gym and a place to be healthy like literally a new kind of school and I was hooked the conference was great I got to meet some of you out there not through the camera but like for real and by the end of the conference I got to meet Peter levels the guy is amazing he's just a guy with with one computer and he makes at the moment $42,000 a month solo developer this is absolutely lutely insane the guy has given me the inspiration I needed to get started and it's still inspiring me like crazy he's super humble super kind we had fun with him his wife and his friends and he just made me more pumped to keep shipping startups and at the same time he invited me to the speakers dinner where I get a chance to meet another of my hero Brian Johnson he's the guy that now you see everywhere that talks about diet and sleep he is an amazing person really thanks to him I got to prioritize My Health Sleep diet and I feel so much better in my body so much more creative so much more efficient and seeing him in real after watching all of his videos it was just just just crazy just crazy the guy is exactly like he is in his videos he looks young and explosive and it was it was just so it was just so good and since my wife and I were in Singapore we also enjoy doing a little bit of City things uh man it's if you have never been to Singapore it's it's a crazy City in 20 minutes you go from the airport to the city center there's no traffic jam everything is super simple you get a Huber in like couple seconds you never use cash you never use credit card you pay with your phone everything is fast efficient it's a very very interesting City and we finished the trip with a little session of wake surfing in the middle of the city right on Monday morning a regular day as a solo prer and then we went back to belly because because I got some work to do if you follow me for a little while you probably know me for shipping startups in a couple days sometimes in a couple weeks but I have made a little exception I spent the last 3 month working on a new software and I'm proud to announce that this video is the official release of the beta let me show you how that works taam here is data FAS it's an analytic tool for startups fer to analyze traffic find out the best marketing channels and discover if a product is worth our time or not so this is my data fast dashboard with some of the website I built it gives me a quick overview of what happened in the past 24 hours for each website I have access to simple web analytics so I can see the visitors per hours day uh whatever time frame this is that I want as well as a few metrics about user retention the bounce rate the session times the visitors on my site at the moment and I also see all the good web analytics data like which Pages do people visit where they're coming from the map of my visitors the brother they're using Etc now now if you have a startup that intends to make money on the internet this is where data fast shines you can connect with lemon squeezy or stripe and it's going to start showing Revenue data on your charts and he's going to try to connect the revenue and the traffic data in order to find out some growth inside for instance I can see in the referal tabs that um from Twitter I'm getting lots of visitors for this site but very low Rue the conv rate is .6% on the other side from these websites I'm getting 20 times more convers way less visitors but way more money and this and it's actually telling me that these seems to be the best marketing channels I have for this month so far then I have access to other interesting data I can see the map of my Revenue where is most of the money coming from is giving me some kpis about the revenue per visitors generated and what's the conversion rate now it's a very early version of the product but I I had to launch this because I spent 3 month on these single products so I shipped this with a cheap pricing and there is even a free trial so you can try at no cost and I really hope you give me feedback so I can make the best Analytics tool for solo entrepreneurs so this here is what my portfolio of startup made in September 20124 around 85% of that is profit and the business is down by 7% well the fact that I'm focusing on data fast for the past 3 months probably does not help shift fast is still quite steady I'm building data fast actually to try to understand where is the revenue coming from for now what I see is mostly Word of Mouth affiliate a little bit of ads and that's it if you watch my previous video you will see that Indie page software made much more money than it used to I made a previous videos to explain how I managed to uplift the Basel line of this revenue and the rest is pretty steady most of those product are run on autopilot which means I'm here for customer support if needed or if there is a feature that is B being requested a lot that I'll ship something but for most of them they don't need my attention it's pretty much self served so there's nothing much to do here and finally I added a new source of income habits Garden my habit tracker which this month made $412 which is pretty good for a vitamin products 30,000 readers on my newsletter I started a year ago and it's been growing steady up and up and up it's a newsletter SL blog I share everything I learned as a solo entrepreneur in a written format for free if you want to check it out there's a link in the description I um I also finished this book by ran holiday it's a really good book it's made of like maybe 20 or 30 chapters about stoicism and how to get things done literally and this is a really good match for entrepreneurs and when I'm not feeling like it sometimes sometimes I reread pages of it just to get motivated and right now I am reading this this book from Naval ravikant um I'm a big big fan of him actually I saw him at the network State Conference in Singapore and um I don't know just rereading the words of Naval is every every things he write is a little pleasure oh and uh this this thing happened GE domain name is ranked 57 domain rating domain Authority 57 which is it's pretty high everybody call me crazy when I bought like those weird domain name that ends with unconventional tlds they said that it's hard to rank on Google you might get blacklisted or something and uh well it's it's my highest rated d right here so I think we should make exotic TLD cool again and um the domain name is super short I don't have to add a com it's like four letters in total so it's very simple and it creates a bunch of opportunities for a new brand name oh and and there is this as well started with something simple it's the best way to get more ideas to build a tiny audience to get feedback to learn there just so many things that just roll after that I went on these guys podcast and we talk about getting startups idea I sh everything I would do if I had to start over again it's jumping off startup ideas it was really interesting podcast I'll add a link in the description if you fancy and I also revived this is my very first startup this is how I made my first dollar on the the internet it was like back in 2018 so I revived the Ling page of that business just to remember where it's all started and how it it does not matter where you start because if clearly if you go to the site you will see that I had no idea what I was doing um the copy is bad the design is bad and this is not terrible because this is like two years of work but the first version of this was was actually very very terrible so yeah I just want so I just wanted to make sure the Ling page is up there just to remember that you can start from minus 100 and still improve from there and uh finally I am no longer using mail gun to send emails the reason behind that is I need to send marketing emails and I don't want to have two platforms one for transactional email and one for marketing emails so I went with recent it's a much simpler to use marketing platforms and they have a support for marketing emails and just with a few clicks you can send emails to your entire audience so you can broadcast new features about your product new update Etc it makes things much easier for developers like me who build startups in public that's it I hope you keep shipping and there is red ink everywhere that's the end of this video cheers

I'm renting this car for 4 weeks and it cost about $ 1.5 th000 and if I leave the car in the garage for one month without touching it it's pretty much the same amount of money I lost because of one line of code [Music] all right so I use a stripe for payment for all of my seven tiny internet businesses they take around 5% cut in all the payments and for me that's around $3 to $7,000 per month which is a lot it's actually more expensive than every other business is expensive I have and it's even more than what I spent in marketing and the fees I pay are always different it depends on the credit card I charge it depends on the currency of the payout it's always so different that I usually close my eyes but sometimes for boring accounting stuff I have to export all the strip transactions and that's when I discovered something all right so these are some of the transactions on my account and there is the the fee the strip fee right here and then sometime there is a this line right here that says post payment invoices and usually it's about5 to $15 per day every year there are around 30 million French people go on a holiday during summertime and today I'm one of them now I understand why everybody wants to come here it's so beautiful I don't mind paying a little premium but I kind of want to know where my money goes so I did a little bit of research about those Tri post payment invoices and I realize that stripe charges 4% to generate invoices 1.6 th000 Us doll for a PDF ouch so I went to my strap account to deactivate this option and on the payment link option there's this create an invoice PDF for 4% but it's already already turned off it took me a while to find the culprit but the reason was hidden in my code so since I'm lazy I'm I'm a programmer after all I use GitHub copilot to generate most of my code and so it generated this function here to create a stripe checkout session so that clients can pay but it turned out that this line of code is the reason stripe creates invoices for every customers and the reason I paid 4% for every transactions after I realized it was just money down the drain I was still a little bit curious and I went through the stripe API documentation so I checked for the invoice creation option and it does not say anything about charging 4% for those invoices seriously stripe but in the end I ended up creating a tool for myself to generate those PDF invoices and I turned it into a startup which I called Zenvo and it made way more money than I lost on those PDF invoices so I really believe that profitable cups are born out of frustration enough Fe we love you hey come here you look like a

my wife is still sleeping it's almost 5 a.m. but I cannot sleep because today is a big day but let's talk about that later let's go to the beach first hey you don't watch that watch this time to [Music] Surf I love B the wings are so so good I have to work out every day but since the waves are so good I never have to go to the gy oh my God two boards two weeks at this point I might have to get a real job soon all right so this is yesterday night and that is today 100,000 followers on Twitter this is insane in this video I want to explain why it was the best decision of my of my life to uh try to build a little audience on the internet and how it change everything this is me thinking that I am the next Mark zenberu dollar ID and after one year it failed completely zero users zero doar of Revenue generation I failed multiple project and I always run into the two same issues first one is that I couldn't get anyone to use my app see if that spent month working on something and that nobody even cares what's the point I didn't have money to run ads and I don't even know how to run ads anyway I didn't want to raise money from VC because I want to work solo with my computer and second I felt so lonely no one in my family is an entrepreneur no one in my friends back then was an entrepreneur so I started with zero knowledge I didn't learn anything from anyone I didn't know anyone I could ask proper questions and so in 2021 I burned out after failing for so many years I was so angry at myself for being a failure that I punched the walls in my room and I decided to quit entrepreneurship and get a job as a software engineer while I was working for a guy that you probably know Ty Lopez knowledge who was not working from his garage anymore back then I discovered cryptocurrencies and I had to go on Twitter to retweet some stuff about nft and for the first time in my life I opened the application Twitter and I was like what if you know I'm just curious and I go over the news feed and I remember seeing a tweet from someone that changed my life I don't know who wrote that tweet but it was something along those lines I am a developer I work solo I travel the world and I make this amount of money I got fired a few months later but it did not matter because this tweet changed my mind and it made me want to go for this new generation of entrepreneurs so I restarted the journey with a totally different mindset I will share everything I built publicly on Twitter and I will try to connect with other entrepreneurs I showed up every single day and 8 months later nothing happened I was writing every day about the things that I was building or the things I was learning but no one really cared it was one two sometimes three likes and most of the time it was actually mine but it didn't matter because in those eight month I made a couple of friends five to 10 people who were doing the same thing as me and I know over the shoulders they were looking at what I was doing and that was just enough to keep me motivated because I couldn't just bust nothing so I had a reason to wake up and work on something that I would share with them it took 8 month to get 1,000 followers and then it took another 8 month to go from 1,000 to 10,000 and and finally took a year to go from 10,000 to 100,000 but it didn't matter because I was not focusing on numbers instead I was focusing on building cool stuff I was learning a lot building my own little portfolio and refining my signature until one day everything clicked so now I build a relationship with my audience they trust me with their attention so I'm pretty guaranteed that whenever I launch a new product I'll get a couple thousands of visitors so I never have to start again from zero at the beginning I would have to work this much to get these results and now with an audience it's the exact opposite and on top of that I got connected with amazing people people that I I never thought would ever talk to me I got the guy the podcast my first million that I watch every week in my DMs and Noah Kagan I did a podcast with him the CEO of absum $100 million a year and he's here wanted to make a podcast with me that's just crazy and if there is one thing I regret is to not have started earlier okay enough of me bragging now let me show you some guys who are doing it right and I think are going to explode soon okay first we have Anthony re Anthony reer anony he is a software developer and he's making the software to help uh Freelancers charge monthly subscriptions for the services the software is a beast very a bunch of really cool features and he's changing the life of its users and at the same time he's documenting his entire journey through very beautiful and well tell stories and at the same time he has a great sense of humor and then we have Max blade this guy is building a habit tracker for developers when you make a commit then he will show this on your habit tracker and he's documenting this entire Journey where it's stuff that we don't see normally like Hardware stuff it's very interesting and he is making really nice videos to share his entire Journey a which team grow from almost zero followers to what it is now in just a couple of week and this is amazing so give those two guys a follow there is just so much to learn from them see you at 1 million I broke a board this morning and the wavs are so good that I climb all the way up there those 350 stairs rush back home pick up this bigger board and came out again for those beautiful ways now that I'm about to upload this video I realized that it's been one year and one day I got married to this person and this might have been the best decision of my life

[Music] this is what my current father-in-law told me on the day I married his daughter and that is what it [Applause] means that place that place it it needs a change I spent the last 900 days in this place at 8 hours a day how how much is that 7,200 hours in this place in this office and it doesn't feel like it's mine I want something that Sparks my creativity my my muse or maybe I'm just looking for an excuse to procrastinate first I'm going to get rid of that big black drawer that's full of junk anyway so that I can repaint the the entire white wall from there to there in the same blue color as the left one so that I can stick on all the projects I'm working on right now on the wall just like this that's my portfolio of tardos the problem is I have no clue how to paint my job is this and beside of that I have no clue how to use this in the real world FY buy P luckily I get my friend to help around another all right looking pretty good let's talk about intellectual property in 2023 I was working on an AI startup to help people learn language in a fun way so if you want to learn Korean with K-pop or if you want to learn French with cheese Cuisine then it will generate workbook so that you can practice with your favorite topics it would create a bunch of exercise like this one and make it inside of a workbook so that people can practice their new language no idea what it means the startup was a disaster but along the way I learned that I was doing the same thing over and over from creating Ling page components to authenticating users to sending them email which gave me a good idea because this AI language product was my 15th startups I created a little Cod base for myself so that I can ship startups faster and I turned it into a product so that other developers can use it and I call that ship fast on September 1st 2023 I launched ship fast I was hoping I could make a couple hundred I ended up making a couple hundred th000 and I was so happy it's the first time in 6 years one of my project is taking off and people are happy and pay for it but I wasn't prepared for what came next I share everything I do on Twitter from the apps I code the marketing strategies that I use and the revenue that I earn and sometimes when someone from YouTube who watched my latest video hacked my Ser I also share that when I created my Twitter account 3 years ago I signed up for transparency I'll be as authentic and transparent as possible so when [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fast took off I started to share publicly my revenue and lots of people were inspired with the revenue numbers but among them some of them were a little bit too inspired and ended up making questionable landing pages that really look like mine well let me show you some copycats so this is the homepage of my product and that is my headline I created it because I know EX exactly the pain of building a startup for one year and getting zero users and shortly after came in the copycat inspired websites there was this one with a very similar headline and it became pretty much the default for any new boilerplate product in the end there is only one person to blame if I didn't want to have any copycats maybe I shouldn't Brak my Revenue like this in public but someone went too far original blue new blo I should have known it at least it's dry casual day binging Twitter I received this DM from a friend and as I've seen many CopyCats in the past I I decided to not even look at the Tweet but then I received another DM from a friend with words that are uh quite serious a copyright compliance and going to Twitter I saw other messages like this one lawyers and blah blah blah so I decided to follow the link and look at what is actually going on and I found this Tweet [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fast for $200 now use [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fast instead does the same thing for a shitty S ID clone the repository and a link to a GitHub rep so I followed the link and I ended up on this GitHub repository which is an exact copy of my repository a customer of mine giving away the code for free to the public on the internet I wasn't really sure what to do so I asked everyone in my company well imitation is the sensous form of fluttery and the laziest form of competition it's time to initiate a comprehensive infringement litigation Str have you heard the latest version of next supports partial pre-rendering which combin static and dynamic Pages man the speed I need to upgrade but no one could came up with a proper answer so I decided to ask my friends some came up with questionable advice hi everyone this is niik for Indie news we are on a crime scene today someone just copycatted the famous influencer marlu to create [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fast so Maru is going to be bankrupt as you can see the cops already present here thank you Nico and some came up with pretty good advice telling me to just talk to him although it didn't go really far so I did what I usually do when I am stuck if you go to that link you actually end up on a place where you can get the code for free for free I mean I think for now it's better to focus on what you like to do in Korea we say so bad thing can be good thing and good thing can be bad thing we will never know focus on what you like Misfortune turns into blessing my wife think that should not obsess over these little details and I should focus on what brought me here as her father told me on the day we got married I think she is probably right so I have decided to not give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we are a couple days after the incident and the guy actually removed the repository so my father-in-law was actually right and by the way I'm trying to turn my boring entrepreneur life into a video that hopefully is not boring so

================================================================================

all right we are 20 hours after the launch day and my software already got 1.6 th000 users registered I was also selected to be the product of the day and I got this little badge right here and the crazy part is that two weeks ago the idea didn't even exist so in this video I'm going to show you how I got a bunch of startups ID I'm also going to show you the product and the text tack that I use and some methods I use to build a product in around 7 days and some software Engineers will not like this part of the video and finally I'm going to cover the launch day and how I managed to get around 7,000 visitors on my lening page let's go how do you find startups ideas this is one of the most common question that I get asked on my channel and the answer is a little bit counterintuitive when I started the Journey about 6 years ago I was brainstorming startup ideas for hours like sometimes even days thinking I will come up with something magical and I implemented those IDs and none of them actually worked but about a year ago I started to stop thinking about ideas and instead I started to build stuff whatever it is and then I would stumble up across problems all the time like DNS issues or like knowledge uh issues or like I don't know where to launch my startups I don't know how to do this I don't know how to do that and then now my lease is filled with startups ideas for instance for the software I just launched here is how I got the idea I have built 24 products and seven of them are making money and I want to build better products for people so I as them what they want to use and for that I use a feedback management tool called Kenny it's a little feedback board where people can suggest features and upot them so I know which one to prioritize the problem with Kenny is that first it's made for a big company so it's very cluttered there's a bunch of features and is very complicated for soloers like me and the second problem with Kenny is that if you have more than one product it cost at least $99 per month which is an insane amount of money for a feedback tool and just like this I had this idea of building an alternative to Kenny that is much simpler for smaller markets the niche of solopreneurs so instead of looking for ideas I buil solutions to problems I experience and chances are I'm not unique so many other people might have the exact same problem as me and they might be in need of my product and when I launch it I saw that many other solopreneurs experience the exact same frustration with other feedback management tools and that's how I know I have a product that uh will be used by users so unless you have been working for a company for 10 years and you know that there's some uh pains in their workflow like they're slow for this or they struggle to hire people then you might be able to have a good startups idea born from that but if you're uh a guy just like me and you spend most of your time home and you just want to build apps chances are you don't really have a problem that can be solved with a digital product so the way to find good startups IDs is to actually to build something anything rebuild a habit tracker that you use make a not taking app a grocery app for you and your family build anything along the way you're going to stumble across problems whether it's not knowing how to implement this feature or struggling with DNS Rec course or maybe it's even a marketing issue and you don't know where to launch your startups and these problems will give you tons of startups ideas so the way to find good ideas is to think less and build more all right now let me show you the text tack I use and how I build a product in 7 days and let's start with a quick demo of the software okay so this is the demo of inso the little feedback management tool I created this is the landing page I like to make interactive demo on the left so the cards are clickable and this is the landing page here for the feature part I like to have some interactivity so it makes people want to discover more so if you hover with your mouse you'll see all the little thing moving here and there and that's pretty much it for the landing page uh once you are signed up as an admin you will see all the feedback boards right here so this is the one that I use for inso as an admin I can change a few stuff here so I can change the themes to match my brand I can also uh manage the feedback that are being given by users uh this one was canceled because I fixed it I can change say that I'm working on this one or I Shi that feature and then there is a public uh dashboard link where on the right side we have all the features suggested by users once they're logged in they can uh click to upot them they can also suggest any features they want right here and they can have a conversation on each uh feedback given if they uh want to add more things there so here is the text tack I use to build this software and this is the exact same text tack I use for all my 23 websites when I don't change my text tack I don't procrastinate and I can focus on shipping features and product it's a nextjs repo so the front end and as well as the back end I have the little API routes by nextjs everything is handled with next I also use tawin CSS instead of CSS as well as Daisy UI for the components so things like uh the buttons the inputs and the forms my database is mongodb I hear you coming super base developers I don't know why mongodb gets so much hate I absolutely love it I click a button deploy a cluster I have it little string I add it to my code and boom it's working and the cluster is hosted on mongodb Atlas to authenticate users whether it's uh admin users uh who log to their actual dashboard or it's just users who want to provide feedback I'm using NEX oath it's a very simple library that has a bunch of social authentification providers so uh Google Facebook and GitHub for instance and I also always add a login by email so like a magic links and for that I use mail gun to send those emails there are tons of developers who don't really like mail gun I really love it it's super simple to get started and they have pay as you go service so for $1 you'll get 1,000 emails which I think is really fair it took me around 7 days to build the product and this is not very common especially for software Engineers is because I make lots of trade-off first I remove a bunch of features that are not uh essential so there is no way for people to delete their account to retrieve their password or stuff like that and my second trick is that I don't use a bunch of software engineer tools so there is no typescript I ship straight to production I don't use G branches I don't test my code I I make all these trade-offs so I can ship faster I come from a developer background so I used to do stuff very slowly very securely I spent years building apps that made zero to sometimes a couple hundred bucks but nothing crazy but after years getting almost no results I changed my entire mindset and I focus more on shipping fast and having a better copyrighting on my landing page and surprisingly at the same time my Revenue went from not being able to pay the bills to about 50 to 150k per month at the moment because entrepreneurship is about making small bets and you can see the pattern applies to most successful solo prur out there they start to ship one tiny feature of a product and sometimes nothing happens sometimes it takes off and go viral and then at this moment they double down on it and they grow a big company my advice is this try to show the smallest version of your product to the world as fast as you can that's how you gather genuine feedback and know if it's worth or not your time and now that we're talking about one of the most exciting part it's time for a little coffee I usually launch on every platform so product hunt RIT hiker news and Twitter at the same time and the goal is to create some kind of momentum and get as much traffic as I can in about one day but I made a little mistake I normally schedule all my post on Twitter to make sure they go right on time when the product hunt launch starts and one of my good friend was in budy for just a week so I really wanted to see him you might know him already it's tibo maker one of the most prolific Indie hicker out there he's built a Twitter tool that he grew to $600,000 in monthly recurring revenue and he sold it for $9 figures he's an absolutely Legend as he was here for just a week we were having a lunch at the same time as I was launching and during the lunch with tibo one of my close friend Nik called me and said the product hunt link on Twitter is wrong and I didn't know if my computer had nothing with me besides my phone so my friend chibo gave me his computer and together during the launch we fixed the launch all right enough of this here's the launch strategies all right first Twitter is the most important part of my strategy because this is where most of my potential users are and they're also very active on product ton so can help leverage the launch on that platform as well I usually try to make one funnyish video you'll tell me if it's fun or not um where I say that I'm launching the startups and I give the product hunt link so people can see the products through product hunt and hopefully they will leave an up vote when they see the product the reason I'm making these funny launch videos is because first they do well on X at the moment videos X doing well it's kind of weird the second part is because I love making those videos I'm having a good time and I hope people can see that and so my tweet is more likely to perform well now that I have close to 100,000 followers on Twitter it's tempting to think that it's easy for me to launch and it's not easy it's just easyer I started to make those fun launch videos when I had a couple hundred followers on Twitter and back then my tweet would get as many views and many likes as my tweets right now even though I had barely any audience there so even though you don't have a big audience on Twitter right now you can still make a nice interesting tweet for for people to discover your product those fun launch videos were my style and I absolutely love it but you can also be just show behind the scene make a video show your computer screen explain why you build the products if you're a person who make and launch app your life is so cool that there are many things you can share on Twitter you just have to find the right format and find your own signature so as I said before most of the launch strategy relies on product hunt I already made a video on my channel last week to show you exactly how you can get traffic and how you can optimize your product hunt launch you can refer to that and finally I launched on hiker news and on Reddit those are two platform that if you get lucky the post can go viral and can give you a bunch of traffic uh unfortunately this time I was not one of the lucky ones but definitely worth considering all right now let's talk about numbers the product has been on the internet for about 2 days now and there are 7,000 people who visited the site from product hun Twitter Reddit and hiker news 1.5 th000 people sign up for the product which is really big and I also got some really positive feedback especially from Peter levels one of the most prolific Indie maker out there who said the product is amazing and he loves the Simplicity of it yay that makes me so proud I also got the badge the product hunt of the Day badge from product hunt which is a good nice social proof for my website and this is just the beginning I hope that some Media or newsleter will probably check the content of product hunt and I might get more traffic later financially wise I spent $0 and I also made 0 as you've seen there is no pricing on the product is 100% % free for now I'm going to leave it as it is for free and what I'm doing in the reason there is no pricing uh which is very unusual if you've been following me I always uh say that we should add a pay Woll on websites first this is a bit special because I'm not disrupting anything I'm just taking an existing product and I'm making a simpler version of it and I think it's not fair for now to start charging for a simplicity so what I'm trying to do is I'm putting the product in as many hands as I can for free and I see how sticky it is um I'm looking for power users I'm looking for people who will use the product for month and either love it or tell me that it's solving one of their pain and then from that I will be able to know if it's worth opening a paid plan on the product and building more uh features for those users so for now I'm collecting feedback and waiting to see for an opportunity all right that's it for this video if you want to see the other 23 products I made I'll share a link to that video somewhere around here and if you like this video consider subscribing to the channel that really means a lot all right until the next one I hope you just ship it

[Music] all right we are rolling I just bought uh ship fast.com for $5,000 us plus another $1,000 for the marketplace fee this is crazy because exactly a year ago I was making around $1,000 per month with my little software and I was counting every Pennies from uh domain names but also everything like food and accommodations and I was trying to buy the cheapest for absolutely everything and ending up paying uh probably what was my annual salary in 2022 for one domain name is just insane um and I was able to get here um because I've been grinding for the past 3 years until luck found me and one of the things that kept me motivated to grind was to compete with friends that's why I added a new competition feature to one of my software called Indie page let me show you you want to be on the Vlog hello rooster about a year ago I created a little software called Indie page it's like a link tree for entrepreneurs basically they creat their profile they add their startups and they have a beautiful uh public page and I wanted to bring some gamification elements so that uh people who need some motivation to get started or to grind and find motivation uh would be easier for them and I added a leaderboard it's basically uh taking every startups and every hours it's fetching the revenue from stripe and it's ranking those startups based on their actual Revenue in the last 30 days so every month people can compete to rank on that leaderboard uh this is exactly the strategy I use to grind for the past three years or so I was competing against my two friends Dan and Nico and you know we would share like who has the most like on the tweets and who has the most revenue on his startups and uh and this is really helpful for motivation hello something fcy boy such a beautiful s it okay one of the biggest update of the month is that I built my 24th uh digital product it's called Ino it's a little tool to collect feedback from customers it was born out of frustration CU Alternatives were either super complex or too expensive and I made an entire video about that if you want to check it's somewhere around here how I get the ID How I build it fast how I launched it on product hunt and got around 10,000 visitors and I actually got the product of the Day badge I was really really happy with that one of the questions I get the most on my YouTube is why do I build so many products instead of focusing on one in my experience there's a lot of luck involved in entrepreneurship um one of my product ship fast made I think close to $600,000 in the last8 months or so and I had zero expectation I really build it uh for myself as a codebase so I can ship faster and it was totally random and it's very hard to predict what's going to happen so the more product I ship the more bets I make and at the same time I learn so much from every product I make from um how to build faster how to make less bugs how to be better at copyrighting I'm learning about marketing like it's just a pure like Learning Journey that I absolutely love for instance a couple days ago I found this guy on Twitter his name is janjo he built a lit Chrome plugin in I think an afternoon or something that helps developers testing credit card with stripe instead of having to type 42 42 42 uh in the stripe checkout it prefills all that and you save a couple of seconds every time you test the credit cards and he sold that plugin for 4.2 uh per customer which I think is really smart and I think in a week he made around ,500 us just selling this little Chrome plugin and I think he after that he even sold a startup for another $1,000 so the guy went went from just about the span of a week it went from just having a random ID to building a product getting customers and getting Acquired and that's amazing CU that's so there's so many things you learn in this little process and that's one of the reason I'm very uh addicted and I love uh shipping so many product are you afraid to what you know is real like any other and we are live in B where the waves are crushing the show this month my family-in-law my Korean family know visited Us in belly I've been married to the lovely Korean girl behind this camera for seven years and they often visit us in belly or we go in Korea to see them I'm from France and so we mix a culture and is very very um C what what is mixing culture is very I don't even know what I was about to say with cultur different person she's from Korea I'm from France and being with a person from the other side of the globe has been so interesting and I learned a lot from it for instance in France if you say bonjour or hello with the not the perfect French accent people will say no bour and in Korea if you say like Hello in Korean with a very broken accent they'll be like oh congratulations they'll be very cheerful so uh it's very fun to mix cultures also I've been learning a lot living here in B I see how people live very different lifestyle very different mindset uh it's so just so interesting to see uh how different we can be and we can learn a lot from each other that's so beautiful I know what it is uh let me open it t it's here it's uh wa if you don't know what it is um it's coming from product hunt product Hunt is a platform for uh developers and designers uh VC startups whoever wants to launch product on the Internet uh product Hunt is the place to launch the startup it's a place where you can get um thousands and thousands of visitors for free actually when you watch this video there might be a video on my YouTube channel where I go over my strategy to launch startups and get traffic for free if you want to check it out and once a year they do this little ceremony where they select the best product for developers the best product for designers the best crypto app and they also select one maker of the year I don't know exactly how they select the maker of the year um in my case probably because I launched over 10 products on the platform uh the in 2023 and they gave me the maker of the Year award 2023 I'm so happy uh because when I studied the journey three years ago I would uh I had models I still have models like mentors people I absolutely admire like Peter LEL Danny bosma Timo maker those guys would get this maker of the Year award and I saw them as like some kind of rock stars and I would absolutely admire them and it would help me grind and show up every day and it's so unreal that it's here like I get the same a word as they gots it's I don't know it just feels really unreal and it's so beautiful but you can be literally no one at the moment like nothing that's working for you and showing up and and you know doing the thing I don't know you can you can get one of this like it tookes two years two and a half years and yeah thank you if you have been around for a while following the journey it really means a lot thank you you're ready to do it that's the place I surf every day cuz I I tend to overthink and surfing really helped me clear my mind okay uh what is your workout routine uh I don't have a routine I don't have much goals with workout I just want to be fit I don't care being bulky I don't care being a gym boy I don't care having big muscles I just want to be feet and lean and stretchy so I can do a bunch of sports so my routine is a bit different from the one you probably see on YouTube I don't go gym I don't take any supplements I don't lift any weight never lifted weight in my life I don't like lifting weight I feel like this is how I hurt myself and it forces me to go to the gym instead I am working here in my house every single day 365 days a year uh 20 minutes workouts uh 20 to 30 minutes body weight only uh mostly cardio and calisthenic uh I follow this YouTuber I love her name is Caroline gavon she's a beast um I do hold her all the workout she does that are not um requiring any weights uh and it's very short so it doesn't require much thinking it's not like a big hurdle I have to do so it's easy to get motivated but once I am in the work out I really push myself like crazy uh sometimes I even get dizzy I don't know if that's good probably not but I really push as hard as I can I don't think about anything else there's no phone distracting me uh I try to make more reps than her uh and I try to never have any break and if I feel like it's too easy whatever I'll do some ABS in between rests uh I would really get the most out of it like really pushing crazy for 30 minutes um and then I eat healthy foods so mostly vegetables uh nuts cereals fish eggs a little bit of meat um almost no sugar obviously no alcohol no cigarettes uh very no pizza pasta or almost never and uh yeah but no supplements but just healthy food is it boring no that's true also one more thing uh to be fully transparent I live in belly so I surf almost every day and when I surf I don't work out so obviously the results I get is results of Fitness like homeworkout plus surf uh but I've tried this like body weight Fitness only routine uh every time when I go on travels and my body stays roughly the same except that that my shoulders shrink a little bit cuz surf is a lot of paddling so it's a good shoulder workout but the overall body weight the overall Body Fitness is pretty much the same whether I do only workout or surf workouts mix let's talk about Revenue this month I made a little over $130,000 as a solo entrepreneur from nine sources of income and seven of them are digital product it's also the biggest month for Indie page my link in bio for entrepreneurs I'm very excited and this is where uh lots of my focus is going on at the moment in terms of money spent I spent around $5,000 for stripe fees so somewhere like 4% of all the payments um what is it $3,000 for ads around $ 1.5 th000 for Affiliates a little bit less than $500 for the Tex stack and $25,000 to Outsource a few tasks so that's around $112,000 of expenses which leaves me with $118,000 of profit I started sharing my Revenue publicly on Twitter when I started the journey three years ago and I do this for two reasons the first one is I want to remember where everything started and I want to remember that it took time and the second reason is because it's very easy with and the second reason is because it's very easy to say pretty much anything with a little bit of Storytelling so I'm not saying that the person with bigger numbers is more right than other people but I'm saying that it's so easy for anyone to say anything on the internet so I just want to add a little bit of proof here but for sure I'm still a total rookie in entrepreneurship all right and to be totally transparent with the Rue and this is the dashboard for one of my product called ship Fest uh this is the daily revenue and this is the revenue for this month I don't want I know you know already okay this has been a crazy month uh it's been a crazy year actually from opening the business here in Asia to changing my tax residency as well as you here launching three softwares customer support marketing Twitter YouTube um I still do almost everything myself cuz the the goal has always been to stay solo so I don't have any meeting I don't have any deadlines nobody's waiting for me uh but it's at the same time it's so uh terring physically tiring I really struggle to disconnect from work I'm looking for boundaries like where I can close my computer and be off work completely but this never really happens I wake up sometimes at 3:00 a.m. and my brain is fully focused on work for sometimes 1 hour or 2 hours uh yeah sometimes I just wish this would go away I hired a therapist this month to help me with bounding if I if there if there is such a thing in entrepreneurship but uh I kind of guess this is you never expect anything and then you have to deal with all the new issues new problems coming up um I also feel guilty saying this because I wanted I wanted this so badly and now it's happening uh there's a part of me that wish he would slow down a little bit uh but anyway it still just a wonderful Journey um the YouTube channel crossed 50,000 subscribers this month and it was about a th subscriber earlier this year so this is just this is just absolutely crazy thank you so much for following the journey it really means a lot um I read all the comments uh except the bad ones but I I read all the love messages um and if you're watching this probably you are not one of those bad comments so thank you for staying around all right until the next video I hope you just ship it cheers

by the end of this video you would have built a billion doll software and get acquired by Google so you can spend the rest of your life testing out every new trendy Tex tax all right I'm not so sure about all that but my promise is this at the end of this video you'll know exactly how to use the platform product tant in order to drive traffic to your website and grow your startups and you'll see that it doesn't require any prior experience or doesn't cost any money but why should you trust me well I got the maker of the Year award in 2023 I launched 21 products on product hunt in the last two to three years and I got 13 Awards and you will see that at the beginning I didn't get anything and then it got easier and easier so there are some knowledge that you can reuse to replicate the same let's go all right first product tun 101 and is it worth launching your startup there there's about 4 million visitors on the site every month and it's high quality traffic there are a bunch of designers programmers agency solopreneurs so uh the eyeballs you're getting there are very good if you end up in the top product of the day you can expect 2 to 3,000 visitors just from the platform but it's not it they also have one of the biggest Tech news Lor out there so if you end up in the top 5 to 10 product of the day you will also get shared somewhere there and you will add another extra thousands or 2,000 visitors to your site and finally there are a bunch of media that feed off product hunt because this is where the new trendy Tech happens so after the launch when the traffic goes down you'll see some spikes coming from other platforms and product tant is very famous so overall it's a very good investment for your startup all right if you haven't launched on product hun here is roughly how it works every 24 hours there is a new bunch of product that are displayed on the homepage of the platform and they're competing to get the most of votes the timer resits at midnight PST and for the first 4 hours there is no ranking based on ofos it's just purely random to avoid the winner takes all after the fifth hour the products start to rank based on their number of up votes and so it's a winner takes all game and if you're at the top you're almost guaranteed to stay around the top and if you're at the bottom it's very hard to claim up that's why the first four hours are the most important and in this video we're going to cover how to get the most up votes during this time there are two ways to get up votes on product tant and first is called the inbound upvotes the up votes that are coming from users who are actually browsing the platform and they find your listing and they decide to up vote it on the product hunt home feed there are tons of other products competing against yours for attention and the way you win is by nailing three things your name your tagline and your logo the name of your startup should be short simple and very easy to read and you would rather ditch uh like VC style names like stripe or Tesla and go for something very logic IAL like ship fast a tool to ship fast if you want a tutorial to make names for products I wrote a short article about finding good names for startups as a solopreneur in the blog in the description below next is your tagline and it's the most important part of your listing it should be very short like 60 to 70 characters maximum it should be one sentence and it should tell exactly why would a random stranger on the internet invest its precious time for your product it shouldn't be about your product but it should be about what it's doing for your customers uh what pain is it relieving how their life would be after they try your product why is it worth their time and finally your logo this is more the creative part that is up to you but if you see that there are many logos that are blue colors maybe go for a green that contrast well you want to stand out and be remarkable now if users decided to click on your listing there's two more important parts the first one is your Carousel of photos you can put I think up to seven eight maybe even 10 the first three matters and what matters too is that you keep those images super simple one image should be about one feature and if you want to add a screenshot of your product this is a very good thing but do not add the entire dashboard of your users for instance make sure that you zoom on those photos and you show only a very tiny part of your software as if the user was actually looking at uh your software very very close cuz nobody would read the text that's inside unless it's a big headline and the last important part of this puzzle is the first comments you the funer are going to write your little story how you ended up with this product ID as the first com on your listing this is very important because people relate with people and stories you are not a VC back company with millions of dollars for marketing who just want to make even more money you are a nice person who just want to quit their 9 to5 and you have a story to tell so explain why you came up with this product ID explain what it engag for you how much time you invested in it and the comment section supports markdown so you can add links for instance to your products so if people are browsing the comments you can directly link them to your product as well as link your social media if if you have a YouTube channel or if you're writing your journey on Twitter make sure you add a link to that part so they can start growing a little following that's going to be very helpful for the next part all right now the second way to get up votes is through outbound up votes it's basically anyone who is not currently on the product on platform but decides to come and help you for instance when I got started I would send my product link to all my family and friends and ask them for up votes but there are many other more reliable way the first one is Twitter Twitter and product hunt have a good audience overlap there are tons of solopreneurs on Twitter who have a producton account and they will be happy to help you and then it boils down to making good tweets so learn the basic of writing how to make a tweet that's easy to read learn how to make a good headline that catch people attention learn how to tell your story in a nice way that people can relate learn how to make good creative that will gets people attention for me it all started with fun launch videos back then I had a few hundred followers on Twitter and I would make those videos where I would go on a fake podcast with jogan or I would go in a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and this felt like me it was fun to make and some people on Twitter enjoyed it so they started to watch the video up both my product on listing and also reshare the link that really helped me boost the product on launch and that's also how I grew an audience I actually made a little course about how I make those videos if you want to check it it's in the description it might sound a little bit discouraging if you're getting started and you don't have an audience yet but remember an audience is not created out of thin air people follow you for a reason and that reason is because you might be the guy who launched a bunch of products on product hunt so you got to start somewhere build the audience or build the products start with the products launch things on product T and this is how you're going to get people follow you on Twitter that later will help you achieve more momentum for every new product hunt launches and of course if you're active on any other social media Facebook Instagram Tik Tok wherever this is you are make sure to share the links to your producton listing there to get some votes another way to drive out bone up votes is through your actual users let's say you have launched a product already and you have 100 active daily users or something like that you can tell them through mailing list or anything that you can reach out to them to help you support the product on launch if they're your users they probably already love you and it's going to drive some more upvotes to your producton listing and finally you want to add a badge to your website a little Banner top left bottom right wherever this is you think fits well that says oh we are live on product hunt for the next 24 hours we would love your support that is very helpful for two reasons first the product hunt users who clicked your websites and are now visiting your leting page it's a good way to bring them back to the platform to give you an extra up and second you can launch your startups on many other platforms at the same time you can launch on Hacker News Reddit Twitter at the same time and you can get extra traffic from those platforms when they see the badge on producton some of them will come and give you a little hands and up vote your producton listing this is what I do all the time I scheduled the product hunt launch and I would launch on every other platform so it brings an extra juice to product hunt and if you want to know how to launch on those other platforms I wrote a little something on my blog in the description okay now you might be convinced it's a good time for you to launch your startups but which day should you actually launch it depends on what you want if you want social proof or traffic if you want traffic Mondays to Fridays are usually the busiest busiest in terms of traffic people actually browsing the site but also busier in terms of competition so it's harder to get an award but it's easier to get traffic and since VC startups don't work on Monday at midnight I recommend you to start launching on Monday instead if you're looking for social proof and you want to get that product tant badge to embade on your site I recommend you to launch on weekends and especially Sundays are usually the calest days so you have let's competition and more chance to get the badge is your product ready to be launched on product well based on the T-shirt I'm pretty sure that you can guess I'll tell you it's time to launch it but I would argue that you should wait until you have at least some testimonials on your site before launching the reason is simple there will be tons of new people discovering your products so you want to make sure you have some kind of social proof because it's much easier to sell a product if people are already validating it and keep in mind that you can still relaunch your product a few month later and you can also launch some free tools to promote your main products so don't hesitate to launch as soon as you have social proof the first product on launch is hard and might not go as you expected but it's a necessary step if you're serious about becoming a solopreneur quitting your 9 to5 and become financially independent it's a tiny step that's going to help you in the future you're going to start growing a little audience on Twitter because people will admire you for launching your product so the next time you launch a product you can ask your audience to help you out which is going to grow a bigger audience and it's going to be like a little Loop that's going to keep going up and up and up and you'll see that after a couple of launches you're almost guaranted gued to have one of the product tant badge and you will as well get a couple hundred if not thousand visitors on your side and grown a little audience so my advice is to not overthink it just launch it and keep repeating the same recipe over and over until luck finds you all right that's it for this video if you liked it you can like the video and if you're looking for other ways to Market your startup I drop a link to my blog below where there are many other uh free ways to Market uh your startup and G customers and until the next video I hope you just launch it

TITLE: The EASY way to set recurring payments (Stripe subscriptions)
VIDEO ID: ag7HXbgJtuk
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag7HXbgJtuk
================================================================================

even though the stripe API documentation is longer than Lord of the Rings there is a very easy and fast way to set up monthly recurring payments for your software in this video we're going to uh create a little pricing table for people to choose monthly or yearly uh subscriptions we're going to deal with stri web hooks to make sure that we Grant or revok access to users based on their current subscription status and we're going to let your users manage their subscription whether they want to update their credit cards upgrade or downgrade their plans or even cancel it and you'll see that we'll be able to do this with just a few dozen lines of code for the tech tack I'm going to be using just a little bit of react as well as an API endpoint uh through the nextjs API route but you can use anything else like for instance an Express server and that's pretty much it if you're new here my name is Mark I have built over 20 products on the internet from AI tools habit tracker a few useless products and some software that I grew to a couple thousand in mostly recing revenue and this is the video I wish I found when I got started first let's start with a quick overview of what we're going to build on the client side so your customers they will be able to select a yearly or monthly plan and subscribe to one of them by entering the credit card details this is going to go straight to stripe create the subscriptions create the customers and STP is going to update our API through web books tell us whether or not we should give access to the user again for the API I'm using nextjs but you can use pretty much anything you want like Express and then once the customer has access they will be able to manage their subscription with the strap customer portal so if they want to upgrade the subscription download the invoice or uh even cancel it and it's going to update stripe and stripe is going to let us know again through a webbook whether we should update or not the user in the database before we start coding let's set up the strip account so make sure you are in test mode and then go to your product catalog and there you will be able to add a new product you can call it the way you want I'm going to call it hello YouTube and set up whatever recurring payment you want I'm going to start with a monthly recurring payment at $19 it's going to create the product you can click on it and you will see your pricing plan here start by creating uh a payment link so just click that button make sure you check this option right here if you work with uh European businesses that would let them input their tax ID so they have invoices with their vat for instance and on the after payment page you want to replace with a custom message that says go back to your dashboard and refresh it to unlock the services thanks for your trust you can create the link and you will create another link for this product so go back to your product catalog select the product you just created and we're going to create a yearly plan so we're going to add another price and we're going to say let's say $99 per year and create the price and we're going to do the exact same thing we're going to create a payment link we're going to allow businesses to input their V number and in the after payment page you can copy past the exact same message we said earlier make sure to say to your user to refresh your product page so that they get the latest data from your API and then create the link and and you're going to end up having another payment link for the yearly plan for each of the pricing we created we're going to did two things per pricing we're going to did the price ID right here as well as the payment link so the URL that you can copy right here now we're going to code a little pricing table where people can choose between paying monthly or paying the yearly and we're going to see what happens when we click on this link for that I have spin up a little next year project so I have this uh page this homepage whatever it is with a component called pricing the pricing component is important there are two things going on first there is this array of plans and you can see we have two objects this one is the monthly plan and this one is the yearly plan we have uh these data for visualization on the table component and we have the payment link uh URL that we copy past from stripe earlier as well as the price ID that we copy pasted earlier and because stripe has a test and a production mode I'm also using process.of not not environment equal developments when I'm testing on my computer and I would set this up to the actual production price when I go live it's important to export this constant here because we're going to be using it later for the web hook all right now we have the components the component is very simple it's mostly UI with the little use states to uh swap between different type of plans the yearly and the monthly ones there's nothing fancy here is just a purely visual what matters here is what happens when people click on the Subscribe button you can see we are going to open a new window and we are going to direct the user to the payment link URL and we're going to prefill the email with with prefield email using the user email for this part of the video I assume that you already have some kind of authentification system I'm using next oath for that as well as a mongodb database but you can use literally anything you want as long as the user is authentification you can pass the user email after the pre-filled email query and is going to prepopulate the user email and if you don't have some authentification in place already at the end of the video I'm going to ver a use case where you can start charging subscriptions to user that is not even authenticated so now now when the user click on the Subscribe link is going to open the payment link and it's going to prefill the user email so we can know who uh paid for this uh membership and then we're going to input some fake dummy data and see what's happening Mark and we're going to say okay and then we're going to back to stripe and if we refresh the page it is this one this customer was just created the subscription is active on stripe and the customer paid I already have a bunch of other payments because I'm testing it with my computer but normally you should have subscription that is active right here and on the confirmation payment page it says go back to your dashboard and refresh it to unlock the service okay now we need to update users in our database to know whether or not they have access and for that we're going to use stripe web hooks so go to your developer tabs and you're going to need two things first you're going to need your API key so you can reveal your test API key the private one and you're going to copy paste it in your project you can call your key whatever you want I call it stripe secret key and then just pass the key right after that because I'm using nextjs those are private and they will never be shared with the client but if if you're using react you want to make sure that you only share those API keys on your back end then go to the webbook part and you're going to say you want to add a local event listener you're going to type this in your terminal so stripe login is going to prompt you to log to stripe and once you're good with that do not run the common number two I'll show you the one we're going to be using so we are going to create a second terminal I usually put it uh on the right side of it and then you're going to use this common stripe listen-- forward to Local Host the port you're using usually 3,000 I call mine /i/ web hook slst stripe just copy paste this and press enter and it's going to set up a little listener on your computer and you're going to get a webbook secret signing key like this one and you can copy paste it in an environment variable called strip webbook Secrets the webbook secret is just a random number to make sure that the calls we receive from stripe are actually coming from them and not from someone else now that we have a stripe local event listeners everything that happens on your stripe test account will arrive on your computer and you will be notified in this console so if I try to pay again here you will see that you will get notified but it also works if I do actions directly on stripe for instance let's say I create a fake payment of $1 I create the payment and you will see that I will be notified here in my console I receive some events from stripe like charge succeeded payment intend succeeded and a bunch of other events and this is how we're going to update users in the database to know whether or not they have access to your product for that you're going to need a little API endpoint for me as I'm using njs I I created a/ API folder and in the webbook folder in the stripe folder I created a route where I have my API Handler if you're using Express for instance uh stripe has a nice documentation they will show you exactly how you do that if you go back to that developer uh page they will show you how to set up your Express server the beginning of the code here does not really matter you see we pull the stripe webbook secret and the stripe secret key here and then we're going to verify that the webbook is actually coming from stripe and then the important part that we're going to in this video is the events we receive and so we have a big switch and we're going to iterate over each events that we receive and decide which actions to take and for us for our simple use case we only have two events that we really care about we're using the stripe node.js package in order to uh query and interact with the stripe API so the first thing we do is we actually get the session object from that customer we're going to extract the customer ID we're going to get some more information about the customer we're also going to retrieve the price ID from the session so if you remember earlier the price ID is the little thing we copy pasted and then we're going to iterate over the plans our plans if you remember in our uh pricing component we set up an array with two objects each of them have the price ID and that's why it's important so that we can get the plan here if there is no plan it's probably some uh bugs or mistakes so we just want to break the loop and move on and then we're going to either create the customer or update the person if they already exist for instance if a customer paid and then cancel the subscriptions and then 3 months later came back and paid again we don't want to create a new customer we want to update them so it's going to check the customer email so the email that the customer inputed in this field here and we're going to search if that customer exist in our database I'm using mongodb this is how I query it it would be the same for uh anything else you're using if there is no user we want to create the the person so we want to uh we get their normally we get their name from the stripe checkout uh we also get the email and we get the customer ID it's a unique identifier in stripe that we're going to reuse later and then going to update the user um there are two things we want to update we want to say the price ID so they subscribe for that monthly or that yearly plan and we also want to update a some kind of Boolean for me I call it as access if it's true the user has paid if it's false the user hasn't paid we save the user and then we're done one thing I also recommend you here is to sending a little extra email like welcome to your product name here is your logging link or something like this to make sure that if the user move on after paying that they have some kind of backup on their email uh box and the second event that's is called customer subscription deleted so stripe will create a subscription life cycle for you when the customer start to pay for um that monthly or yearly membership and they will send you events frequently uh if the user has paid the invoice if the subscription has renewed cancelled uh upgraded whatever you only want to listen to the subscription deleted this is fired when the customer cancel the subscription and they reach the end of their billing cycle this is usually the time where you want to stop providing access to your customers so for that we're going to get back the subscription from stripe we're going to first retrieve it with the ID and thanks to that object we know uh the customer ID unique identifier for the customer we're going to retrieve it from our database this time and we're going to turn off their Boolean and save the user and this is pretty much all you need to have a subscription that either grants or revoke access to your customers there are also some nice tripe even that I'm going to share with you just in case you have some more uh complex or you want to do some marketing things for instance the stripe checkout expired event is when the customer don't pay and they leave the checkout page you can sometimes access their emails and this is when you want to tell them like hey you did not make a purchase here is a 20% discount for next checkout or something like that the customer subscription updated is fired every time there is some events like the subscription is renewed every month you'll receive an event normally you don't need to do anything here because we just revoke the access when the subscription is actually deleted the invoice payment failed event is fired after a customer was charged but it was not successful let's say your customers will have money on the bank account then you will receive this event in some cases you might want to block subscription right away but usually it's quite friendly to wait until the end of the billing cycle to stop granting them access so you would normally don't do anything here unless you want to stop the subscription right away after a fail payment and finally the invoice paid event is fired after the opposite happens so when a customer credit card is charged if you're using the previous even to stop giving access as soon as the payment is failed then in the invoice paid you might want to have the opposite effect which means that you get the customer and you give them access back every time they make a successful payment but again in 99% of the cases you only need those two events all right let's see what we have now so we can create any subscription I'm going to go for the yearly plan and I'm going to input some Demi data the test credit card is 424242 we're going to be in 2025 and I'm going to say uh I'm going to be John this time and then I can subscribe to the yearly plan in my backand I should receive the stripe events right here here uh one of those events is supposed to be called checkout session completed and this is where we're going to create our user in the database we're going to double check my mongodb making sure that it was actually created there we go when I refresh I see the user so I have those information so the name and the email provided during the checkout as well as some stripe uh information like the customer ID and the price ID and we can see that the user has access to the product so we can give him or her uh probably him in this case this is John access if we double check in stripe and refresh the customer tab we will see we should have a new customer created called John here we go and he has an active subscription now I want to test if the revok access is also working so I'm going to cancel the subscription immediately and on my backand I should also receive some new events somewhere here actually I received it already it was really fast customer subscription deleted which is the second event we're listening to this one which normally should update our database and remove access from the user we're going to double check that in mongodb again refresh and and we can see the user uh does not have access anymore so this is working okay now we want to let users manage their subscription so either upgrade plan cancel change download the invoice change your credit cards and all that things for that go back to your product catalog and pick the monthly plan and you're going to say in the upsell category say upsell to the yearly plan and then in the search tab type customer portal and in setting Billings customer portal you should have this page um I think I turned mine on already uh there might be a button to turn it on in the subscription part here you will want to uh select the products that customers can um subscribe or not so you will find your product here the yearly plan and the monthly plan save the changes and you're going to copy the link that is right here and then in your code so this is my uh homepage or whatever user dashboard page I created a simple react component button customer portal in this button I just get the user session so I know their emails and I also have the link I just copied from the customer portal and when the user is actually authenticated I just have a link that goes to that customer portal link plus I add the as before for the checkout the prefill email query with the user email in the end and then when I click on it on the user side it's going to open the striped customer portal with the email prefilled from here customer can receive an email to log to their customer portal and manage everything so this is my Gmail if I click here is going to open my stripe customer portal and then the customer will receive an email it looks like this and when they click on it they will access to their uh billing portal where they can update their plan or cancel it as well as changing their payment method adding new credit cards building information invoice history and a bunch of other cool stuff a few things once you're ready to go to production uh go to your developer tab turn off the test mode part and copy your actual production API key and in the webbook tabs you will have to add your own uh website so add an endpoints your domain name/ API webook stripe and add the events you want to listen to Because by default they're known so you want to listen checkout completed this one as well as the subscription deleted here we go you can add events and at the end point and you should be good to go in the case you want to start charging a subscription before logging users in which I think is a really good way to increase your coners rate you want to make sure that first on your payment link confirmation page you tell people to actually follow the instruction received by email and in your webbook Handler you want to make sure that at the end after creating the user it actually sends an email to the user with a link for them to log in if you already have a business that's processing couple thousands of dollars on monthly recuring revenue and you need some very specific granular control you can try to create customer portals and checkout session using the API but if you're getting started this setup will work for 99% of the cases and actually if you're also getting started I recommend you to play around with onetime payments of their subscriptions the strip setup is exactly the same as I just showed you but you'll see it's much easier to sell a software for $99 lifetime payment than it is to to sell a $19 monthly recording payments and when you're getting started you'll see it's very important you start making a little bit of money at the beginning because you will keep you motivated and one time payments are much easier to sell if you want to understand the logic behind this I'll share a video around here to explain that that's it for this video if you liked it you can like it if you enjoy it you can subscribe to the channel that will really means a lot and until the next one

TITLE: 3 lessons from 900 days of coding startups
VIDEO ID: ebcakmRzl0I
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebcakmRzl0I
================================================================================

after I got fired as a software engineer in November 2021 I started building tiny little websites with one goal in mind become financially independent as I'm recording this video I made $121,000 in the last 30 days with seven website I built 92% of that is profit and I am a solo developer wearing underwear all day long except when I'm making those videos I don't have any employee I don't have any meetings I don't have any deadlines I got lucky in fact exactly one year ago I was making $11,000 per month with all my websites and when I got started I made $ for 5 months I would never believe what's happening today because there is no magic recipe for success but I discovered something when I started the journey 900 days ago I joined Twitter and hang out with other developers chasing the same dream build our own app and Achieve Financial Freedom every day we'll share progress we make on our little website and share our learnings but after a few months not getting really good results most of them stopped showing up daily and gave up but a small group of developers did not give up and keep showing up fast forward to today most of those developers make well over $10,000 per month so here is the thing luck is math if you show up for long enough even though you don't feel like it luck will find you I launched website in the void for 600 days there were tons of opportunities to give up but I kept showing up every single day and I would never earn 120k in the last 30 days if I gave them so here are three ways I manag to say consistent and motivated shipping apps every day for the past 2 and A2 years the first project I work on as an independent developer is called mood to movie it's a very simple app that recommends movies based on your mood it took me just a few days to build the first version of the product because in my head there is some kind of monkey that wants to have instant results so I can easily convince him to work hard for a couple days but it's much harder to get it to work hard on something without getting results for month in fact in 2017 when I started the journey I spent an entire year working on a product that got zero users and I just burned out completely and stop working on any project for another year so now whatever I have an ID in mind I always try to ship the smallest version of that product usually one feature that I can build in a couple days sometimes a week and show it as fast as I can to customers I usually don't like hanging out with people I spend most of my time alone or hanging out with my wife but being isolated is no good and at the same times humans are very social creatures and we can leverage those social interactions to motivate ourselves when I joined Twitter 2 and a half years ago I would follow other developers doing the same thing as me and I remember this guy called dun he was writing crispy tweets and he had around the same number of followers as me and every morning I would try to make a tweet that would have more likes or engagement than him it usually did sorry buddy there is Another Monkey in my brain that wants to play game so I compare myself with other entrepreneurs at the same stage so I can leverage my desire for competition no jealousy just healthy competition because in the end we all win most of my product made at least $1 and so I was really tempted to focus and try to grow each of them and actually people ask me often why do I work on so many project instead of focusing on just one and there is another monkey in my head that have expectations the more time I spend on a specific task the higher the expectations so I could select one project and keep adding features and features and features but that will also grow my expectations and if nothing big happens then I will just simply burn out instead I will launch a tiny website and move on to the next project unless something big happens like it was the case for ship fast one of my products I would rather quit too early and miss an opportunity than quit too late and burnout shipping websites is like a muscle if you on progress you have to practice consist L try looking one hour every day with you and your code editor until it becomes a habit and to avoid losing motivation and stay consistent try what worked for me sh very tiny little projects join some kind of community where there are like-minded people where you can healthily compete against them and quit even if it's too early so you don't burn out in the end entrepreneurs who show up daily will be rewarded I've seen this with my own experience as well as other developers so now it's your time to commit and feel that GitHub contribution board all right if you want to see the 20 plus website I built as an independent developer here's a link to another video and if you enjoy this one consider subscribing to the channel that really means a lot and until the next video I root for you and I hope you just ship it

I'm going to show you how I use hiker news to drive well over 25,000 visitors for my software AI tools and habit trackers you'll see there are some patterns you can replicate to get visibility and customers for your own project but there are some very strong codes on hiker news and if you don't want your post to go seen or worst getting banned you want to avoid the three mistakes I will share at the end of the video let's go at the very beginning of the journey when I just got started and had zero experience I launched mood to movie on hicker news and within a few hours the post went viral it got 5,000 visitors at the beginning and I didn't know but it was the spark of something way bigger there are tons of other platforms that feed off hiker news content and when they see top performing post they will usually reshare the content later and so occasionally I would see my app movie being re-shared on other Platforms in Tik Tok news lators and other Tech aggregators and sometimes even in languages I don't understand a few months later I replicated the exact same formula for my habit tracker called habits garden and the post went viral again hitting the front page of haer news and this time the app was monetized so I made a couple $100 and also reach 100 Mr within just a few days and I keep replicating the same formula over and over for the past 2 and a half years and even though not every post will go viral it usually bring good traffic and customers for my own project and I'm going to share exactly what I learned if you don't know what hiker news is it's a tech news aggregator read by developers software Engineers it's run by the community so anyone can post anything and other people vote and choose which post goes up or down and you will see why this is important for us later it was created by y combinator the famous startup incubator so there is a special category for people like you and I to share our own little startups even though we don't aim to build unicorns let me show you the results I got with that the first thing you want to do is to post in the right place in hiker news there are a bunch of category only one matters to us it's the show Hacker News category this is a place where people like you and I where we can share our own little project when you submit your post write show hn column before your title that way your post will automatically be posted in the right category of hiker news first your post will be shown in the/ new subcategory it's a mandatory Place uh every new post has to go through and if it gets a couple of OD votes then he will go to the SL show category I suspect there is a moderator that checks the quality of those post so follow along with the uh things not to do later because this is very important if you want to be promoted if your post is promoted to the slash show category you will get a bunch of traffic couple thousands of traffic as well as a lot of comments and feedback from the community and sometimes if you're very lucky your post will appear in the slash category the main homepage of Hacker News I've never been there but I've seen some other Indie makers reaching that stage and you get crazy traffic all right so the second part to increase your chances to go viral is to be very personal you are not a faceless Corporation trying to make more money you are a cool developer building cool apps in your bedroom or after your 9 to5 and you want to showcase that start your post with something very personal saying things like I made I built or after 6 months coding blah blah blah those usually go pretty well just tell your own story with simple words all right the third part is you want to use The Hacker News language it's a community that's read by developers and Tech enthusiasts so you want to talk to them and for that you want to use Tech words like GPT for SEO or whatever llm is being released at time of the video if you're using generic words like a course coaching or e-commerce it's likely to be ignored unless you turn it into a techy world for instance my habit tracker called habits Garden is just a simple habit trucker but the fact that there are some uh games features like leaderboards and competing with friends I use the word gamified I gamified a habit tracker to fight procrastination and thanks to that the post went viral and get well over 10,000 visitors so you won to make sure to include some kind of techy words in your post the fourth and probably the most important tip is to tell the outcome your post will be competing against dozens of other higher News Post and you have 60 characters to convince someone to click on your post and for that you want to tell exactly what people will get by clicking on it all the product we buil serves a purpose and you want to showcase that part in your title why is it worth my time what's makes it special how is it going to help me if it helps I have a simple formula I use pretty much all the time I start with I made to be personal then I include the product with if possible a tech word like a nextg boiler plate and then I tell the outcome like to ship startups faster or to automate all the boring stuff and finally you want to contribute after you make your own post go in the comment section and write the first comment and explain your story like hey I'm Mark and I realized I was spending lots of money for stripe invoices so I built an alternative show people that you're an actual human behind the post tell them your story tell them what may you create these products and if your PO get up and start to get some traffic you will get some genuine comments from hiker news readers they're usually pretty rough but they're also pretty accurate and they give good feedbacks make sure to reply to comments and ask question because that could be really helpful for you to know which features next to build for your product all right now three mistakes you really want to avoid if you don't want your post to go unseen or even worse getting banned the first one is to avoid emojis don't ask me why Hacker News doesn't like emojis so don't use them the second mistake and probably the most common one I actually made did in my post got B is to ask for up votes unlike other platforms like product tant where you can ask friends and family to support you on hiker news it's against their policies as I said before I believe there is a person that decides which post can be promoted from the show new category to the show category and I'm pretty sure that moderator has access to some more data that we have so for instance if you send your Hacker News Post to friends and family the moderator will see that the traffic is coming directly from that link or that the up votes were made by new Hacker News accounts which looks pretty suspicious instead of asking for super ort spend more time crafting your headline because this is how your post can go viral and finally do not overthink it there is very little you can do to influence the reach of your post so make sure you craft a good headline post it and move on your first post might not be the one that goes viral but if you keep repeating the same strategy over and over you increase your odds of winning there are many ways to get traffic for your startup even if you don't have an audience I'm working on making those videos to help you get customers and if you don't want to miss them out you can subscribe to the channel and there is a link to my blog in the description of this video where I share almost everything I know about marketing you can check that out until the next video I hope you just ship it

TITLE: Why your side project makes $0
VIDEO ID: _P28Or4MOUI
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P28Or4MOUI
================================================================================

I built 24 project in the past 2.5 years at the beginning only 25% of my project would make money now in the last year 100% of my site project made money and for that I had to fire the developer in my head to become an entrepreneur now I only launch product that people use love and pay for so that I can work on any project I like from anywhere in the world without having to worry about paying the bills so in this video I'm going to share the five developers mistake I made that kept my site project from making money mistake number one adding a free plan to your product sounds like a good idea but it's killing your Revenue I used to spend about a year on a habit tracker that had a free plan and a Premium plan the reason for the free plan is that I wanted people to try the product to see if it was a good fit and eventually if they like it they would upgrade to the paid plan I spent over a year working on it before I sold it last year around October and I managed to get 140,000 visitors to the website and back then I had zero audience so I was basically working day and night for that out of those 140,000 visitors about 10,000 signed up for habit tracker and at the end of the year I made $6,000 knowing that I spent my entire year working on this that's a really minimal amount of money so here is the red pill only 3% of free users will upgrade to the Premium plan let's take an example let's say you have a free plan and a $10 per month plan that means your average user is worth 30 cents to your business now let's say that you need about $3,000 per month in order to maintain your lifestyle that means you will need 10,000 new users every month or about 75 5,000 monthly visitors I don't know how about you but that sounds like an insane amount of work for a solo entrepreneurs especially if you have a 925 and you have to handle everything for your startup from the legal the customer support and all that so why do we keep seeing free plans everywhere on the Internet is because all those startups are usually VC backed they have a lot of money so that they can spend hundreds and thousands of US dollar into marketing so they collect a bunch of user feedback and they can build the next unicorn but if you're like me you might want to stay solo and you might have a limited marketing budget if any and you cannot afford to spend thousands of US dollar to gather feedbacks so having a free plan is literally slowing you down in your journey to get profitable there are three alternatives to free plans in case you somehow need to show a part of your product to customers before they purchase the first one is offering free credits you basically let your users try your product but for a very limited usage just so that they know what the product is about without getting any benefit from it the second alternative is having a short free trial with a credit card ahead so as for the credit card because you want your users to commit email is on a commitment a credit card is and make sure your free Tri is short 7day maximum in order to people to commit and the third alternative which is my favorite as a developer is to take a standalone feature of your app and make it as a free tool you could see this for instance with ahref tool their keyword research tool is free and if you want to dig more into it you have to purchase their membership this is also what I do with one of my product called logo fast people can generate logos for their startup for free and if they want to build a startup by coding it they would have to purchase ship fast building free tools is amazing especially as a developer because first you fulfill your developer need of creating things the second part is a good way for people to try the product without having to sign up and everything and the third part is good for marketing and building a little audience because you can launch all those little free tools on product time tradit hiker news get some traffic and things will happen you'll learn how to launch and yeah overall I really recommend trying out free tools m number two is the shiny Tech syndrome every week I would see a tweet about the new nodejs killer or a YouTube video about the latest design Trend and the new UI components library to try out and just like as a normal developer I spent a lot of time in the past trying out all those new tools but as I started to make money I had less time to try this tool and spend more time with my users sticking to the same Tech stack and guess what happened I not only ship less bug because I know exactly the tools I'm using I was also way more productive but most importantly users don't care about the invisible users only care about one thing they want a solution to their problems and the shape or the color of the buttons you're using don't matter at all to them if you're a developer and you're looking to make money with your code all those videos and tweets are pure distraction these new tools and libraries are like an endless treadmill every week there will be a new trendy one or a new better one that improves the performances and it never stops and the only way to be productive is to pick one text Tack and stick to it if you don't have a text tack yet I will link somewhere in the video about the text T I'm currently using for all my 24 products mistake number three subscriptions that's a little spicy topic back in May 2023 I built a landing page generator using AI people would pay $39 and so that they can type a prompt my software would generate an entire landing page for them it was working pretty well it was making about100 to $200 per day I think back then it was my most successful product and I decided to change and play around with pricing so I studed to charge a $5 per month subscription instead of a $39 one time payment as soon as I pushed the change live all my sales went down like literally zero for days I revert back to the one time payment thing and things started to pick up again as a developer or a business owner I love subscription it has a sense of passing income and it's helping me predict what's going to happen the next month but as a user you probably notice that we hate subscription there's some kind of headaches going around is because first you have to think about the future what happens if I don't use the product in 2 weeks what happens if I forget to cancel the subscription there is some mental process that's required for people to pay for subscription that doesn't happen when you charge a onetime payment and so roughly selling a $49 onetime payment product is as hard as selling a $9 per month subscription the second drawback of subscriptions is that users turn all the time it's not because someone decid to subscribe today for your software that they will be paying in 6 months from now so unless you have an excellent service your users will anyway way churn as a business owner you probably have onetime payments like a book you pay once and you own it forever is pretty uh pleasurable for a customer and it's helping you getting your first sales online and depending on the product you're making you might have negligible costs of running the service for instance the bandwidth is usually negligible I have half a million page views per month on my app and I'm still on the $20 per month versal plan so even if the user end up costing 1 cents per month you're still Way Beyond profitability for years and if your service EXP Lo and there are a bunch of users coming up you can also grandfather your current users keep them using the product for that onetime payment and start implementing subscription for new users if you have some kind of recording cost let's say you are doing an AI wrapper around the open AI API then you can try the pay-per-use system just like open AI you would make them pay for the usage of your own product this is really fair for users there's no much mental energy spent on their side because if you don't use the product you don't pay that's very simple and I believe this pricing model is going to replace most subscription in a few years I recommend you to start as simple as you can with a one time payment of the pay-per-view system make $1,000 and then think later if you need to implement subscriptions or not mistake number four the H1 tag first impression matters when you meet someone randomly in the street how they behave how they look what they say will influence every decision you'll make about this person it's the same with your website when you're selling a product online your headline is the first impression and this is going to be the most influential part part on whether people will decide to buy or not your product in average a website conversion rate so visitors to customers is about 2% if you're getting started is likely going to be more like 1% even less so for 100 visitors you'll get one user that means that most of the people who visit your website will never see your product but 100% of the people who visit your website will see your headline so make sure you spend enough time crafting a really excellent headline before launching your headline should be short trigger an emotional reaction and answer the question of why would a random stranger on the internet give me 1 minute of their very precious time I wrote a short article about copyrighting for learning Pages you can check in the description the link to my newsletter mistake number five over engineering for my first entrepreneurship project I spent an entire year building a startup I wanted it to be perfect with a bunch of feature user onboarding and a dozens of screens by the end of the year I burn out and I managed to get zero users and made Zer actually that's this little first project right here that you see we've seen earlier that about 1% of your landing page will convert into paying customers so most people will never use your product and to avoid shipping features that people don't need I recommend you to try the 24 hours startup framework if you had to create any startup in 24 hours how it would look like if we talk about Airbnb it could be just a single spreadsheet and if we are remaking Instagram that could be a public Google Drive I'm not saying you should Che a sketchy version of your product but I'm saying that instead of having a big master plan for your startup start with a very tiny version the 24 hours version of your startup as a b line and start building from there in my case I remove a bunch of things from the first version of the product there are three categories the first one is that I remove anything that's invisible to the customer so I do not test my code I do not use git branches I ship directly to production and I do not use typescript and there is a big support button on the website in case if anything goes wrong but that really doesn't open open the second part is that I remove everything that doesn't have Direct Value to the customer so there is no dark mode there is no professional logo there is no reset password form for instance and finally I remove any secondary feature customers come to my website because they have one problem and that problem is usually solved with one feature anything that is not about that feature will be removed from the verse version of my product the goal here is to launch your product fast so you get real user feedback early and you can build the right features for them and make some money I have been building tiny startups in public on Twitter with 100 of other developers and the five mistakes I just shared is usually what sets apart the solo developers who actually end up making money with a site project and those who don't I hope this video is helpful if it is please let me know if you could subscribe to the channel That would means a lot and if you're one of those developer who overthink their side project I'm going to share a link to a video where I shipped a software in 3 days all right that was it for this video and until the next one I hope you just ship it

TITLE: I made $83,212 in March | Solopreneur Diary
VIDEO ID: aGyaL-AyDkQ
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGyaL-AyDkQ
================================================================================

[Music] this is going to happen hey it's Mark and welcome back for this video I'm starting this new series where I will make a short video about everything that happens in my life as a solo entrepreneur I go over things that I built like softwares and products I'll over marketing things that I tried that worked and didn't the revenue that I earned and everything else like if I travel or nice books that I read workouts stuff that I learned I'll try to share everything and be as transparent as possible so I will share the good parts but also the parts I struggle with so if you like this Ser please let me know so I do it more oh and also here is my story really quick I got fired 2.5 years ago as a software engineer and I discovered at the community of developers building tiny startups in public on Twitter meaning that solo developers a q Andi who have no ambition to build a unicorn to raise money for VC or even to have any employee just building their tiny little product and I fell in love with the mindsets so I started to build my own project and today 2.5 years later I have grown a little audience of 880,000 people on Twitter where I also met a bunch of friends there this is actually the t-shirt from one of my Twitter friends I also built 21 projects and currently I have 10 stream of income and in average my salary is around $50,000 per month so I'm going to share everything that happens in the month of March let's go all right so now let's talk about work I created a new very tiny software called popup the idea is to increase the website conversion rate by displaying popup notifications it's almost started as a joke the inspiration came from another product of mine called Zenvo one of my friend actually the friend that gave me the T-shirt Dan told me to make it a product and there it was I spent 3 days building it I used AI heavily in order to build a software I'll share a link somewhere here where you can see the video on how I built the product really fast and I launched it without any expectation and 24 hours later it made $1,000 and about 2 weeks later it was at $25,000 in Revenue it's almost pure profit so it was overall pretty nice a very interesting experience and it also gets results for people I've seen a lot of customers coming back to me that says they love the product and it's working well for them so tiny experiments that turn out to be a good thing all right and so far the product that brings the most Revenue to my income is ship fast it's a b plate for developers to ship startups faster and I got a testimonal from a customer who made 2.6 th000 Us in 9 days and this is probably the biggest testimonial like Revenue Wise from a customers that shares the revenue publicly just as a comparison this took me years to reach that point I was stuck at $1,000 per month for so long so big kudos to him I also shipped a new component for the Vol plate called with without it's tiny component that people would typically use under the hero section of their website to show what it is to live without the product they're selling and to live with it it's like basically a before after and this is also really good to improve website conversion rate and I usually get inspiration from all the other products that I make in order to get inspiration for ship fast components so I know what's working and what's not working I also added a new feature for Zenvo my little software for stripe users to generate invoices for their customers without paying the stripe fee now it displays the stripe account name when the email is being sent about two months ago I did a little experiment with AI and SEO so I have a product called logo fast which is a free logo maker it has a little bit of AI in it where if you want a logo for your business you could describe your business ID the AI will reply with the icon that would fit and the colors that would fit and it will suggest you three logos when the user clicks on one of the three suggestions it will save the logo in a database and my server will create an HTML page optimized for Google in order to rank and a few weeks ago Google started to rank all those pages so I have generated now almost 3,000 logos so I have 3,000 pages that are now indexed by Google and I hope that these pages will rank hopefully if it happens it should happen within 3 to 6 months I will definitely report uh the experiments but I think it's pretty fun to see how AI plus a little bit of a human touch could create those valuable HTML pages that could potentially rank on Google I have 21 products and seven are making money and so I sometimes get drowned into data which app should I focus on where should I spend my time and attention and I found a new metric that really helps me to decide which is worth my time it's the kpi is the revenue generated per unique visitor so if a product gets 1,000 unique visitors and generate $1,000 this is a $1 per unique visitor as a matter of comparison my best product ship fast gets 93 cents per visitor and my worst conversion product is by dispute which gets 06 Cent per visitor it's very simplified you know there are opportunities for some mistakes in there but overall I found it really helpful and very clear on where to put my attention on I also did a podcast with Arvid KH he's like the father of solo entrepreneur is a really nice person I will link to the podcast somewhere in here if you want to listen to it we go over the addiction of building apps and all those kind of things filed startups in the past and I would drive my mind crazy I would spend a year building a product that nobody would ever want and finally the probably the biggest highlight of the month work-wise was YouTube I have been making one video per week every week since January this year and my channel was around 5 to 6,000 followers most of the people were probably watching from my audience on Twitter nothing was really happening and suddenly YouTube decided to take one of my video and pop it up and it's crazy in 6 days my channel went from 8,000 followers to 15,000 followers which is absolutely crazy to me my channel was already monetized but it was making $2 to $3 per day which is not crazy and now it's making about 40 to $50 per day which is here in B it's like a living this could pay the bills so this is overall absolutely crazy it's also the first time for me to Outsource a task I do everything solo from product building to marketing to customer support to legal things and I hired someone to make those videos so uh let me know what you think about them all right now a little health update I search every day about 2 hours and 6 months ago I hurt my back I have some back pain in the bottom and one of my friends actually the same friend who the same friend who gave me the t-shirt and who told me to create the poop up startup gave me a pull-up bar and so I do pull-up and chinups every day and also bar hang to flatten my back and this is actually really helpful it has eased the pain to a point where I almost don't feel it anymore and my wife and I are trying a new experiment where we do not eat any food after 5:00 p.m. and go to bed at 10: p.m. and this is working really well we've tried this for the past 10 days and we have a very good restorative slip I also bought a ring the aura ring sleep tracker a couple months ago and I got rid of it it was nice but I felt anxious about getting the perfect sleep score and ironically it would trick me and make me anxious about it and get a worse sleep so I got rid of it and my sleep is better okay now little life update I was reading the book called same as ever by Morgan howel it's it's a book about things that never change in the world it is a really good book for anyone whether you are Developer entrepreneur whatever this is a book that will teach you how the brain works it's a lot of psychology it helps understand how people behave it's very interesting my wife and I also went to Taiwan for 2 weeks we would break our home routine every month or two and go to a different country in Asia we love Taiwan we have a new routine there you're a star you're Hollywood famous so we would wake up around 6:00 a.m. and then we would go straight to a workout after drinking a coffee we always work out together so it's easier to find the motivation to get things done then we would do a little stretch have a healthy breakfast together around 7:30 8:00 a.m. and then we would both go on our computers and work for 4 hours straight where we stay offline so no Twitter no emails just basically most of the time coding or making those videos writing my newsletter but like pure 4 hours of focus then we'll close the computer for the day and we rent a scooter and we would just go around places and wherever this is we're boring tourists we don't do any specific places we want to visit we just get lost with the scooter or by walking and uh this is pretty uh good fit for us we usually finish the day with a 1 hour to 30 minutes walk you got a new friend what and then we come back home take a shower and sometimes watch a movie and go to bed and start the exact same day the day after and in Taiwan we also met a friend from Twitter and I love the fact that now we can find connection Interest online and then meet in real life now let's talk about Revenue I made $83,200 I've been sharing my revenue on Twitter for the past 2.5 years and this is my Revenue in March 2023 back then I made 1,000 us from my product and this month I earned 833 times my salary back then that's absolutely crazy I guess that's why entrepreneurship is so addictive and probably the power of showing up every day now let's break down the revenue for these startups first the most important one that brings the most revenue is ship fast the revenue almost double this month making about $75,000 in the last 30 days this is my Tri dashboard but I also collect payment from other sources like PayPal I guess the revenue double because YouTube picked up my video and decided to put it on the homage so that increase the number of visitors and eventually the revenue and the revenue for my other products like any page or by dispute is pretty steady I barely don't do any marketing for them so I don't expect it to change much I'm happy the way it is because it's solving my own itches and I just like it this way my YouTube channel got monetized back in February this year back then I made $50 and this month It Grow significantly we're sitting now at about $800 for this month and this is pretty nice I would literally pay for my villa here in Valley okay so that was for the money in now let's talk about the money out for business expenses I spend about $4,000 a month for everything plus 3.5% goes to stripe to process payments there is about $300 that goes for the tech stack so my newsletter affiliate program servers database and all that $700 goes to affiliate people who like my product and Market them in exchange of a commission I also spent about $1,000 in ads I'm not very good with ads a friend of mine Nico is helping me with it and usually $11,000 in would bring $2 to $3,000 out and I also spent about $2,000 to Outsource a few tasks like the video editing right now I also lost one income stream it's viral but it's a little software that I created back in 2018 when I started my first solo prer project the wrong way everything was tough back then I stopped I abandoned the product in 2020 and it kept making money until this month where the last customer turned it was a 200 bucks per month subscription so yeah that hurts it's the end of a passive income era and it was a good time and for personal expenses my wife and I rent this place for about $800 per month and we spend I think in total about $2,000 for basic stuff like food we don't like buying physical stuff uh we sometimes go to a good restaurants but we barely don't spend anything I think my most addictive thing is coding apps and luckily that is free all right and just one more thing my YouTube channel recently popped up and if you look at my previous videos it looks like I am doing some kind of overnight success making 50,000 bucks a month I want you to know that it took 2.5 Years starting from zero to get here I have been struggling a lot finding motivation to get things done and sometimes even questioning my entire work thinking that it's absolutely useless and if you actually dig deeper in my story you will see that I have been in the game for about six years not very seriously at the beginning but I've tried a bunch of stuff felt a lot of stuff really a lot of stuff yeah this is not an overnight success but I hope this shows you that if you stick to something and you show up daily then you would get good results all right that was it if you enjoyed the video please subscribe to the channel That would really means a lot all right cheers

================================================================================

let's talk about Tex Tac I get a lot of suggestion from software Engineers who mention that I could save some money by switching to another text Tac or maybe a new UI components Library that's trendy but I never listen to them and I always stick to the exact same text stack and thanks to that in the last 2 years I was able to ship 21 products and those products are getting 260,000 page views per month and are making over $50,000 in revenue and I'm working solo and I handle the customer support and there is barely any problem and the Tex tack only cost 67 us per month all right now let me show you exactly the tech that I use all right so for the front end part I use reactjs it's a very popular JavaScript library it has a bunch of extra Library like drag and drop features for instance that can plug and play right away and some people say that it's quite complicated I only know 10% of reacts I just use use State and use effects in 99% of the cases it's way enough for all my apps then I pack all that into a nextjs application it's very good for page routing and to have nice page is ranking on Google and it's also super easy to use to style my apps I use tawin CSS I feel like it's much easier than CSS because the style is return return directly on the right HTML tags so it's easy for me to understand what's going on and on top of that I use a UI Library called Daisy UI it has a bunch of components like uh buttons form cards that make things way faster to ship there are a bunch of new design Trends popping up every day which means new UI components libraries coming out and to me that's just distraction customer don't care if I'm using the latest gradient colors or whatever so I stick to that UI Library it's clear it's simple they have 30 or 20 plus themes that I can customize so whenever I ship a new app I would pick a theme and find a cool type face on Google phones and boom I have an entirely design cool looking apps that's up and running all right and for the backend part for my API I would use next year's serverless functions whenever I clone a Nexus project I just add a file in the API folder and I have an entire API endpoint that's up and running I don't need to install packages I don't need to maintain an OS it's just working so well for me and I never had any trouble with overcharge for several less so all good with that for the database I use mongodb I don't know why developers don't like mongodb I love it it's so simple I click a button I open a new database and in minutes I can make queries and I can add anything I want to that database it's just so simple and I absolutely love it I set up a m0 cluster for each new project that I start which is free and just in case things go wrong I do occasional backups cost me about $10 per month and so if something goes wrong I can still use a database backup and restore all the previous data when I'm coding on my computer I use a local version of mongodb that lets me avoid making a network request to the production database when I'm coding so I can code in a train in a plane remote somewhere in the countryside if there is no internet and the the database is here and I can do everything I want and I also don't mess up the production database just in case on top of mongodb I add mongus which simplifies the queries they're more English friendly I would say all right and all my apps use user logins to send things like magic links so that they can sign up with a secure token I would use mun as an email provider for that it's free to get started it's super easy and you can set up a bunch of domains that you want for each of the apps at the moment I'm recording the video I spend three to four us per month in order to send 3 to 4,000 emails which I think is really cheap and finally I use stripe in order to process payments whether it's onetime payments subscriptions credits it works for literally anything stripe API is a little bit daunting when you are getting started there are a bunch of things going on so I will link to an article that I wrote to help you handle stripe subscriptions all right so for the hosting part where my websites are actually leing I use versal for that uh so I push my changes to a GitHub repo and then versal automatically pulls the changes that I made and deploys it to versal instance and I have 21 projects running on versal at the moment it gets over 50,000 visitors a month and I still pay $20 a month so overall pretty good really happy with versal and the Simplicity it's bringing and all my databases are hosted on mongod DB Atlas where I have over 21 clusters and most of them are m0o cluster which are free to monitor data to actually see what's going on in my apps I use a few Services first is plausible it's a simple script analytics that lets me track how many visitors are my my site and sometimes occasionally I will track events like did people click on that button or not it's costing me $29 per month at the moment which is surprisingly the most expensive part of my text te if I receive a customer email support and something goes wrong there's a bug that I don't know where it's coming from I will check the virtual deployment logs it's free to check the last 24 hours and it's usually when I catch the bug and for advanced monitoring things like split testing I would do it manually with the database I would store some kind of like integer in the database randomly and then just make the relevant query in the database see I don't let's say like the last 100 sign up customers filter them by their split test number and see which one purchased which one didn't I don't use any other services for that because I barely track any data and if I need to I would just use the raw mongodb queries and finally some of my products need specific features so for instance I would use AI models for products like logo fast where I help people generate logos or for Workbook PDF to help the help again people will generate workbook to learn a new language I use GPT for under the hood and I spend about $20 per month in open AI credit if I need any other cloud services I would go to Amazon web services the two most common that I use are awss 3 a big bucket where I can host images and this is what I use on Indie page where people upload pictures of their startups or their profile picture this is where the image would go and I also use from time to time AWS think cloud front it say CDN so images or videos load faster for things like a course for instance and a final touch it is not really part of a text tack but I hire a junior software engineer called GitHub co-pilots it cost me $10 per month and it's helping me code way faster I'll link to another video I made about how I turn on a startup ID into the first $1,000 in 4 days using GitHub copilot when I learned how to code I remember struggling finding the perfect text tack but I wish I knew this text tack don't matter customer don't care about the visible what matters is that you pick one text Tack and you stick to it it's like a muscle the more you practice one rep the more comfortable you'll get with it and the faster you'll be able to do it and the faster you ship the faster you'll get customers all right that's the end of the video as always if you like the video you can like the video if you loved it you can subscribe to the Channel please also let me know in the comments if there are any topics you would like me to cover and until the next video just ship it cheers by the way I got someone to help me

TITLE: I made $45,250 in February 2024
VIDEO ID: ZzquF3ie-oA

================================================================================

in February 2024 I launched one new startup and added two sources of revenue to my income in total I made $4,250 as a solo entrepreneur with zero employee in this video I'm going to break down everything that I did this month and also why my revenue is down from $57,000 in January 2024 and finally a new routine that I found that helped me produce a better and deeper quality uh work let's get started I spent most of February working on Zenvo my new startup it is a no code tool for stripe users to let their customers generate invoices themselves uh without having to pay for the stripe fee I got this startup ID when I realized uh I gave stripe $1,600 Us in 2023 to generate invoices for my own startups it was a bitter feeling uh the option was turned off by default but I just didn't realize I turn it on after that I decided to turn off the option and then my emails were flooded with customers asking for invoices uh mostly Europeans who need to have well structured invoices with vat and so I had a new startup ID born there was something painful and there was also a financial outcome it would actually save me money uh to build a startup so I built it and I wanted to do something different I built it live on YouTube uh with uh you guys who came and join the streaming it was really fun to connect and also it helped me be more productive so so I would have to show up every day and I cannot just go on Instagram and CH chill when I'm on YouTube so uh overall it was really fun to be doing this um although the entire setup um you know relying on uh Bell internet connection which sometimes drop off uh was a bit stressful but it was overall really fun experience that I'm probably going to do uh one more time this year I spent about 8 Days building that startup Live on YouTube and once it was done I launched it everywhere um I actually shared a video of that launch day uh in the channel in my live videos You'll see the day probably nine is the day we launched it I went on product hunt Twitter hicker news uh Reddit uh I made little videos for that and the product got somewhere around 4,000 visitors within the first 24 hours which also got the first customers to my surprise it got the attention of some people like gear Mo R the COO of versal a billion dooll company I think he enjoyed the little notification popup that I created this is absolutely crazy to me as I am just a little uh internet maker alone in my room and I get the attention of really famous people like this it was just mind-blowing also Peter levels uh of the most prolific Indie makers out there retweeted the launch um and that kind of made my day and added a bunch of visitors as well overall the launch was pretty successful it made $2,000 within the first week of launching and I have some promising signs that uh there is a potential for this startup because customers would email me that saying oh finally a solution for that so it feels like I'm relieving a pain for some people which is a promising ID for the future all right now let's talk about my product bringing the most revenue shiest shiest is a botle plate for programmers to ship startups faster it made $39,000 this month which is down from $49,000 back in January this year it went down maybe because uh it's been 6 month that been running the product it has made almost $300,000 and it might be fair to say that it has reached the the EOS the tech ecosystem and there is some kind of Market saturation going on or uh maybe it's just me uh not spending enough time marketing it uh I'm not so sure about that but at this point it really doesn't matter because um I receive messages from people who are actually shipping startups and making money online thanks to ship Fest and that really fires me up I also added two new components to the boiler plate thanks to the launch of Zenvo uh there is now a new testimonial component as well as a with and without competent my four other startups had a steady Revenue this month bringing about $3,000 um I have no customer support whatsoever so this is some kind of true passive income if I may but this would not be possible if I didn't have an audience of 75,000 people on Twitter talking about Twitter I made $250 in February from the creators earning Revenue nothing crazy but I'm just happy to have this little income income stream and also added 5,000 new followers and if you just join discover my Twitter thank you and finally I added a new uh stream of income to my Revenue it is YouTube I just got U 5,000 subscribers on YouTube uh this is just mind-blowing I think my Twitter following helped a lot and my channel got monetized a few weeks back and I already made almost $50 uh which compared to Twitter Twitter is pretty nice and it's just so fun like it's a New Journey and I'm just so happy to keep going making those videos and this month I started to follow Brian Johnson's blueprint routine in order to improve my health and this was a mistake I bought a uh sleep tracker in order to calculate my sleep score by the end of the night and I realized that the Deeds got me really anxious because I was getting obsessed getting the perfect sleep score which ironically would keep me awake at night and make my sleep score worse so I ditched the ring I got back to my simple routine where I don't work past 6: p.m. my wife and I would go out of the house because that's where we work at night we would stretch play games uh read books whatever uh which is not work and my overall uh sleep would be really good actually in the past 5 years or so I have put sleep as my number one priority without tracking the data it literally changed my life it made me much more motivated to work uh it improved my creativity made me um better at handling Stress and Anxiety this is by far what has impacted my life the most if you can take care of your sleep all right that's it for February for the month of March I expect pretty much all my Revenue to go down because I have a really big project that I want to focus on um I expect it to be about 3 to six month of work which is a little bit daunting uh I'm a little bit stressed about it but I think it is the right thing to do and so I'm going to go uh on holiday and disconnect a little bit from the internet and spend some times on that project um I will also document everything I can on YouTube so if you want to follow along uh you can subscribe to my channel and if you are looking for another video to watch um you can watch a day in my life as a solo entrepreneur living in B I hope you like the video if you liked it you can like it cheers

TITLE: I sold a SaaS before coding it...
VIDEO ID: qj6Hy1u05NU
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj6Hy1u05NU
================================================================================

in 2018 I made a call from Japan to a business in the United States and I sold them a software that I did not create that's how I made my first internet dollar and that's how I built a software business that lasted for 5 years and made almost six figures in revenue and is still paying the bills today even though I abandoned it for years ago hey I'm Mark I am a son entrepreneur and I built small internet businesses that are now making $50,000 a month in Revenue at 90% profit with zero employee in this video I'm going to break down how I created my software without knowing how to code how I grew it and what's going on to in 2018 I moved to s South Korea I was there because an high school friend of mine was already there and managed to get $11,000 uh an investment from Angel Investors and he offered me to become the co-founder we created an AI startup and we hired two employees in the little office in the middle of s and we were trying to predict the the price of flight tickets uh we felt miserably we couldn't deliver anything valuable um but it was a very interesting experience because I learned something about me which is I want to to be 100% free I don't want employee I don't want investors I want to work on my own little project and so after we moved on I had zero income uh and no savings so I started to do some side gigs where I would go in movies uh as a actor in the background uh they would pay $200 uh a day for like 12 to 14 hours of acting I wouldn't do much uh I would just get some makeup and and get paid at the end of the day I would have one gig a week which would pay just enough for me to be able to leave and eat in s South Korea I started to brainstorm on Startup ID uh that I could work of on just by myself so I would go to this little uh co-working space in the basement near my house they would provide free coffee and free snacks which was really good at the time uh back then in 2018 uh messenger uh and WhatsApp Bots were very popular so basically it's uh automated replies from a business that can chat with a customer to help them uh I've been a gamer my entire life uh so I thought why not having some kind of game on messenger or Whatsapp that could entertain potential customers give them a discount coupon if they succeed at the game so that the business could grow and so I came up with this IDE of a messenger bot that would actually be an entire escape room so you would have a lot of puzzles and riddles uh that you could you can play and if you finish the game you get a discount coupon um back then it was just an IDE but now I have to show you the software uh so you have um a better understanding of what I had in mind so this is a customer of mine on the left side uh they would sign up on my website and then they will connect their Facebook page people will be able to play uh those games once the Facebook page is connected on messenger so the B here is automated it offers some rles and puzzles that people can click um if I want to play this game for instance the there you go you would have uh the the automated replies from the messenger Bots that will challenge you you earn some points and at the end if you get enough points you get a discount coupon for the skap room business uh I was a terrible programmer back then and I know we would would take sometimes to build something like this but luckily in my co-working space I made this guy on the right Andre which is a very um successful marketer and later became my friend and he told me then why don't you just build it before why don't you just sell it before you build it and uh I had nothing else much at the time uh it was very reliable so I was like oh why not let's give it a try so I started uh to send C emails to escape room businesses uh would say something like this I can help you get more traction or get more customers usually my code emails would be three lines um I would always add the name of the business owner at the top and try to explain a little bit how how this thing work um I sent those emails and I had to go to Japan for a Visa Run I had no money so I ended up in the cheapest and the tiniest uh room in OA Japan uh but I started to get some replies from those businesses and uh one of them wanted to get on the phone call with me and I uh did the call and this changed my entire life uh so I was in this room I was tired and uh the C was K for somewhere in the afternoon the Wi-Fi was bad so I had to go down in the living room it was really hot it was noisy there were people um I was I I was a terrible marketer and a terrible salesperson uh but I jump on the call and the call lasted for 42 minutes of cringiness and awkwardness and eventually at the end she said uh yes I'm in and uh she wanted to move on and get that uh messenger butt set up for her page and she asked for the payment page uh I sent her the link and she paid and eventually she turned uh just only recently 2023 after spending almost $5,000 on this messenger bot so that call entirely changed my life because it was my first dollar online and without knowing it after this first Fone call I made $5,000 I went back to Korea more motivated than ever I had paying customers and I had a product to build but I was a very bad programmer so I started to like find uh pieces of codes on YouTube and GitHub and try to assemble some product I would bring my computer everywhere um even when I would do some gigs and I would build in the bus eventually I ended up building a product that was working and I also made this little website with some U social proof and everything but I had no idea how to authenticate users like how to create a proper account so people would click here they would end up on a stright payment page they could pay and then they would have to fill a form that asked for their Facebook page and their email for contacting and I would manually have to set them up instead of logging them through Facebook and do it automatically um I started to get few more customers and because we had no reason to stay in South Korea we moved to Bal with my current girlfriend who later is now my wife um my days were would be really chill I would spend most of my time building I had a very um specific time schedule so I would surf in the morning and then I would come back and do marketing so I would do cold emails like I did in the past C worked and a little bit of Facebook ads I would also um try to take care of my health by doing some stretching and uh reading books and on the afternoon I would work on the product 90% of my customers would come from code emails and as a product guy I have no idea how to send good code emails so I follow this guy Alex who write about sending code emails that sell and I would take his templates personalize them for the industry I was in so ESC room businesses and I would add some variables like the business owner name and the business name uh then it was matter of getting uh leads and leads contact so I would go on trip advisor and type Escape rooms in CT and I would end up on their website and usually on their website of the business somewhere in here you would find the contact if you scroll you would get the email of the business a way to improve the conversion rate it's important to add the name of the person so the manager or the fer uh to make sure that it's personalized for that I would go back to Trip Advisor I would scroll through the review section and usually a member of the team or sometimes the funer would reply to comments of customers and add their name and sometimes even their business email I would just get that name here and I I would add all the information I collected to a sales pipeline it's basically a four stage pipeline um where I would per put the new contacts in here send them one C email if they don't rep I'll will send them another one 3 days later and on and on and on until I send four emails if some of the reply I would try to engage with them and get them on a zoom call uh back then in 20188 Zoom was not popular so it was quite hard but once they were on Zoom I knew that 60 to 70% chance they would subscribe for my services I would call col 10 new leads per day and I would send also 10 emails per day and in average I would get one to two reply and I would get one to two calls per week I would charge 199 per month for these messenger Bots but I was also experience some turn uh so I would I would get some customers and and some other customers would turn which would at the beginning uh make my Revenue around $1,000 to $1,500 per month so I started to experience with yearly membership I would say I would sell the bot for a discount for a yearly price at $2,000 and to my surprise some people actually paid I would get a sales notification from strip that says I received a $2,000 uh payment which was massive for me especially living in Bell where I would live with about less than $11,000 a month um the business the mini business started to grow a little bit I would have 10 to 15 customers at the time across uh the US the Europe and Australia and the business look uh like this uh C it was about $1,000 in 200 19 and I would keep growing growing uh I started to implement annual annual payments here and eventually it ended up reaching $6,000 in monthly uh revenue and then covid happened in February 2021 because of covid escape from businesses had to close their locations and I had two options either I was too greedy and I keept charging them uh the monthly recurring Revenue until they tell me hey stop or I just gave them service for free until someday they will be able to reopen which is what I did so they will I emailed the entire list of customers that I had and I uh told them like he I'm not going to collect any payments until things get better so obviously the revenue went to zero for 4 months as you can see here there's absolutely nothing um I was in Bal back then which uh I was pretty lucky because Co was not really bad and I could Surf and for some reason I felt disconnected from the business so I started a YouTube channel about surf just to keep me busy for a couple month trying to decide whether I'm going to keep working on this business later or not in August 2020 things started to reopen a bit so escape room businesses could open their doors and make some money u a lot of them had closed because of like they went bankrupt or they just you know business owners wanted to do something different uh so you can see here things started again not as crazy as they used to be uh but I didn't do any marketing and it was still paying customers from the previous year 2019 uh I would make 1.3 1.5k per month which is uh pretty good for here in Bal regarding the fact that I was not doing any marketing around this time with my wife we went back to France and we got married we eventually got stuck there and couldn't come back to Bal for about a year um things also went a little bit wrong in my life I got uh I think depressed and uh not in the right shoes so I decided to abandon the business completely uh of course customers would keep their uh service I had nothing to do to provide the service anyway cuz it was like an API I was just not doing any new marketing and andb boing new customers and eventually it's been four years since I haven't touched anything and you can see here the revenue is slowly shrinking and it will at some point to reach zero per month probably in 2024 and now recently one of my biggest customer turns bring the revenue down to $200 a month this year uh this was Alex uh they had two locations and this spend almost 13,000 us on uh my software which uh seems like crazy to me when I think I just got started with a couple of cold emails this is not a typical Silicon Valley unicorn fer this is just a random guy trying to make a living with its app in his bedroom this story led me to where I am today where I have all the freedom in the world where I can surf spend time with my family spend time with my wife and take care of my health anytime while also making $50,000 a month so whatever this is you have in mind just get started because you might be one C email away from closing a $5,000 client

================================================================================

hey it's Mark in the last 3 years I taught myself how to code managed to get a software engineer job and get fired and I also built 20 websites that are now making $50,000 a month at 90% profit and zero employee I'm going to break down all those sites but before I'm going to share uh how I ended up in this journey in 2021 I was living at my parents house and I was a bit bored so I Tau myself how to code using UD me and uh YouTube videos uh this is me learning how to program at my parents place um within a few months I started to apply on Angel list which is now I guess well found and I miraculously found a job as a junior software engineer and within 5 months they fired me CU they realized I was a really mediocre programmer but thanks to the job I realized that I actually love programming because it kind of reminded me of Lego which I used to uh be crazy about when I was a kid where I could build stuff and with programming you can show it to people and it can be of use of other people so back then uh it was the end of 2021 I moved to Bali and I decided to work on projects of my own build my own websites my first website was uh this little thing where uh you can find movies that are related to your mood if you're in a romantic mood maybe you want to watch some uh whatever movies um and I get I get to love the process of like building and launching those websites um I would go on product Huns and share my uh website there it would uh get a little bit of attention I will also share it on Twitter uh with other people doing similar things where I also get to me a lot of friends uh I studed Twitter in 2022 with zero followers and the fact that I was sharing what I was doing um I managed to build a little audience there and made a lot of friends and when I realized I could actually also make a living by building website I studed to focus on other tools like AI tools like this one where uh you can make an entire landing page uh than thanks to AI um I built softwares I bu I built productivity tools uh anything think that I could add a pricing on so I could pay my bills and fast forward to 2024 um my Revenue in the last 30 days is almost $60,000 and I am a solo entrepreneur I built about 20 websites most of them never made money uh a lot of them may make just very like very little money and one of them is uh paying the bill much more than I need so I'm going to break down the revenue for all those this is making uh less than $100 month it's a uh AI tool that will create workbooks uh so you can practice a new language based on topics that you like so if you like uh K-pop you can learn Korean with K-pop topics it will craft the workbook just for you um I also built a software called viral libot I used to work with escape room businesses uh to help them get more uh customers they would get a messenger bot which is what I called a viral bot um this is it on messenger it's a an automated conversation with uh it's not even an AI it's just a basic um you know just a basic replies but you can play games as a player and you can say oh I want to play this game and the bot will reply to you with uh some riddles and if you solve the puzzle you can get a discount coupon for the escap room businesses I work with and that would get them more business and I would charge a monthly subscription for that I also built a buy dispute it's making uh I would say less than $1,000 a month which is a tool a no code tool for developers like me who work with uh with tripe uh to avoid getting dispute chargeback like Angry customers that would uh make yourself get banned from the platform uh it connects to the plat to your strap accounts and you can add rules uh where you say oh if this then that and if something suspicious happen then prevents the action uh I also built something called Indie page is kind of like a link tree for entrepreneurs where you can showcase your startups and you can connect with your your payment provider so it shows your revenue and it links to all your startups it's making um actually this is built using Indie page uh it's making 1.2k in the last 30 days um I also created a course recently uh because some of the video some of the product that I would launch on Twitter and product hunt uh I would use videos like this one where I would embed myself with a personality either in a movie or someone that's famous uh to help the launch uh to get some awareness during the launch and this made uh about $6,000 in the last 30 days and finally uh my biggest product is ship fast it's a code template um that you can use to ship startups faster I used to so because I made 20 website I realized I was doing the same thing over and over uh which is like sending up a database uh sending emails to the customers processing payments handling the subscriptions and so I package all that into a bottle plate and this is making um about $50,000 $50,000 a month and finally uh this is not a website but I got paid by Twitter uh this is recent um it's paying something between $150 a month to sometimes $400 a month uh which is pretty cool because I love Twitter so being paid for something a love it's it's super nice um and yeah um I didn't count this but I also sold three startups last year on this platform acquire. comom uh it's a place where you can buy and sell mro startup like a product like a habit tracker for instance uh I sold one for $10,000 uh this is this allows people like me who have no ambitious to um build a unicorn or go crazy and raise VC and have a lot of employees it allows people like like me um just you know make a living and and get into the startup world without uh going super big and finally I have a new later uh that's called just ship it that is about to reach 10,000 subscribers it's not monetized and I have no intent to monetize it U but I keep sharing my learnings in there and if you want to join it I'll add the link below I'm taking YouTube seriously this year and I'm going to share everything that I do and learn about this entire um entrepreneurship for developers Journey uh so if there's any questions or anything that's helpful please let me know that would help me craft better videos cheers
