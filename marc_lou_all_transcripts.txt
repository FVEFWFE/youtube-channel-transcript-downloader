TITLE: I Made an App to Live to 120+

================================================================================

This is what happened when you book an entire business class. I wake up and make stuff I'm excited about. It's an app that has access to my entire health data. And from that moment, I remember nothing. Leave like a &gt;&gt; to leave until 120 years old. There are three important parts in the workout. &gt;&gt; I spent an entire day doing nothing. All right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Then sign the deal. [Music] We leaving Korea. No. &gt;&gt; You were leaving your parents. &gt;&gt; Oh, it was so nice living with them. &gt;&gt; It was really fun. Yeah. Literally one month going back as when we were teenagers. &gt;&gt; My favorite part was eating breakfast with parents all together and we talk about life. The more I grow up, the more I appreciate family time and have a deeper connection as a same adult. And they're very supportive of what we do with this even though it's not very their world. I think we're boarding right now. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Welcome to how we on right now. Okay. Bye. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. Pokémon everywhere. Hello Pikachu. Even the wing has a samurai bird. &gt;&gt; This is what happened when you book an entire business class. [Applause] I got Alex Ori on the line. He's asking me, "How did we get so rich?" &gt;&gt; What's your favorite flight? Sorry. &gt;&gt; It's about AGI and super intelligent. It would be the biggest revolution ever. It's already here, but it's the beginning of something much bigger. Hello Mark. &gt;&gt; Hey. What's up? &gt;&gt; Do you remember this? &gt;&gt; Holy moly. That's good old times, right? &gt;&gt; Happy anniversary. It's been 8 years together. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's true. All those photo of us, we were party so hard. &gt;&gt; Do you remember him? Frank? &gt;&gt; Yeah, Frank. Of course. He let us meet. No. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was actually doing teo teo with me in Korea and in the Korean culture the you know, you go drink soju after you're done. And he's a good drinker and he made me drink some soju and I was like I just remember the dinner and then after he was like, "Hey, you know, let's go clubbing and stuff." And I know you were you and like people from the startup center were at a certain club. So we went to that club and from that moment I remember nothing. Complete blackout. &gt;&gt; So our love blew from the darkness. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a nice way to put it. Yeah, we were drunk as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; In Korea, when when we live together, we always partied, sleep at 1:00 a.m. or even later. &gt;&gt; Yeah, even later. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we always went to convenience store like eating the cheap sugary food. Our health was really, really bad back then. You could tell from the photos. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, things has been changed. I think when we started the jumping rope jute workout. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because we were very poor back then. So, we couldn't afford gym. So, we just follow the jumping rope guys free workout routine. So, we used to go to the park on the top of the mountain. &gt;&gt; And then we were so poor. I remember the breakfast we were having. We knew nuts were healthy, but also nuts are expensive. And we were sharing like 30 g of nuts. fleet into. And then we went to Bali and I think there's a second time of change because we were surrounded by all those like healthy fitness people. &gt;&gt; There was something that triggers in the brain. We're good about diets and workouts and we stopped drinking alcohol around this time, but there was still this mindset of like, oh, I got to wake up early and I got to do my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it doesn't matter if I sacrifice an hour or two of sleep because I can work harder. And I remember that costed me a burnout. Like I was not thinking clearly because I was wanting to grind more. Then I read the book and I was like, "Oh, maybe we ditch the alarm, the morning clock." And then we started to prioritize sleep again. And then we feel so much better. &gt;&gt; But still health is really hard cuz even though we do everything so well, &gt;&gt; there are some days that you feel very tired, negative. We actually track our health through oop the fitness like the health tracker. It says the record is great. my recovery is the best and I slept well but still I feel tired so I feel like there is another reason we cannot connect the dots &gt;&gt; that's kind of what I want to do with bio age I hope that eventually there are patterns between workouts food supplements and sleep and eventually you realize like oh if I eat this food too much then my sleep is disturbed and I also think there's a little bit of randomness in life we're now robots so it's also normal that days we're tired and days we're not tired &gt;&gt; well we're lucky to have each other always motivate each other to be healthier and not giving up and we are trying to find a reason together. So maybe this week we check our routine with body weight and see who is getting younger more cuz we're very competitive. So if we are playing game I think I'll be even more excited to keep up my health routine and nail it. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; What's going on? &gt;&gt; I spent the entire day making this video and I got nothing. I literally got nothing. I wasted the entire day. &gt;&gt; What kind of video? &gt;&gt; Launch video for that. &gt;&gt; What's blocking you? You couldn't find nice idea. &gt;&gt; I have beats of ideas and I cannot stitch everything together and I try different stuff and it didn't work and it was super [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So you're doing at least 10k step today to build &gt;&gt; not even that's why I run &gt;&gt; I didn't I achieved nothing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; you know all the great philosopher they had to walk to have amazing idea. So I think you're on the right track. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm far from being a great philosopher because I cannot even come up with a freaking video for it to launch. God damn it. &gt;&gt; It's time to go to bed. True. Actually, very true. &gt;&gt; 1 hour before going to bed, we wind down. &gt;&gt; I know, but I feel so guilty. &gt;&gt; It's okay. Tomorrow will be a new day. And it's better to sleep to turn off your brain so you can restart strong. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; Such a terrible day. I'll make something out of this. I'll be back tomorrow and I'll make a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] banger video and nobody will know that I spent an entire day doing nothing. But it doesn't matter because the video will be out there. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Just outcome is important. No more blue light. We're going to the cave. We always set up AC 18°, no sunlight. Wow, look at this magical room. &gt;&gt; Good night. &gt;&gt; I just woke up and for the past hour or so, I was in a weird conscious unconscious mindset. I was kind of thinking of yesterday and I think I found the video I want to make. Actually, here's a little teaser of what's coming. &gt;&gt; Straighten your back, stand tall, and walk over to her. &gt;&gt; Hi. Uh, I see you there. And I I didn't want to regret not talking to you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Why? &gt;&gt; Um, it's because, uh, I really have, &gt;&gt; Mark, open up your chest and look straight. &gt;&gt; Might be a complete flop, but I think I got something. So, I guess she was right. Sometimes you just got to let it go, turn the computer off, and start again fresh the next day. Okay, now it's time for coffee. Time to enjoy the sunrise, go to the gym, and get this done. Look at this first papaya tree of our house. Good morning. It's already time to do workout. Today Mark went to surf. So I will show you how we do training to leave until 120 years old. There are three important parts in workout. First lift the weight three to four times a week. Second run two to three times a week. Third, walk 10k steps per day. So, I'll show you how we train in daily life. Chip makes our workout routine. Usually, two times of lower body, two times of upper body. And today is shorter and chest day. So, let's train. Wait before you cannot miss coffee before workout. Drive slow. &gt;&gt; So, we just finished the workout and I'm so starving. Let's see what's in the fridge today. &gt;&gt; Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; She's taking over the YouTube channel. This used to be Mark channel. Now it's WJI channel. Da da da. The meal prep makes the life so much easier. So, we prepared all the ingredient once a week and it makes us so much easier to eat healthy because I just threw all the ingredient to the plate and change the sauce daily. One time of hard work saved the whole week. One, two, three. Tada! Lunch is ready. As a finisher, we're going to put Brian Jen, extra virgin oil, and apple vinegar cider to lower the blood sugar. Welcome to our vegan day. Every dinner with tofu, tempe, beans, and every two to three days, we eat full day of vegan meals. On the bio age, we updated the goal. Every meal we take a photo then it will calculate how much calorie, protein, carb, all those macronutrient but also the sory fat and sugar level. &gt;&gt; This app I think it's probably one of my least used app yet the one we use &gt;&gt; the most &gt;&gt; the most. &gt;&gt; Yeah, true. &gt;&gt; Every single feature added there is because you requested or I needed it. Actually that's um I think it could be an interesting topic. There are lots of people who build stuff with the intent to make money. This one is really an app made for now for us and you can tell by the landing page. It's the most anti- business landing page I've ever made. &gt;&gt; So, is it different from your previous apps? &gt;&gt; Not really in the sense that every apps I've made are apps that I would at some point need. I think it's coming from the frustration of 2018 when I was working for escape room businesses and I gave zero [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about escape rooms. like not in a bad way. The tons of problems to fix that I just don't care about and this one was one of them. And now I'm really trying to focus on building only apps that I experienced the problem. That's how she pass was born. &gt;&gt; That's how fast &gt;&gt; cuz the course I wish I had. Yeah, exactly. And then most most of the time data pass cuz I really want a a tool for me that is like my founder dashboard where I see my revenue traffic etc. And bio age now for health. I want to wake up and make stuff I'm excited about. For me, I have to care about I have to have the problem to care. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, scratch your own itch. &gt;&gt; Scratch own. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? &gt;&gt; I'm being photographed by Paparazzi in the lounge in Malik. &gt;&gt; We have something we haven't finished. &gt;&gt; Oh no. She's always competing against me. &gt;&gt; We need to see the results before going to France. &gt;&gt; Oh no. &gt;&gt; The game we started in Bali must finish in Bali. Before showing the results, can you say how hard you tried versus how hard I tried? &gt;&gt; We'll see the result first. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; I'm 18 years old, which means 15 years younger. &gt;&gt; So, actually soon I will be doing illegal stuff &gt;&gt; cuz I married a a minor. &gt;&gt; Recently, I picked up running and that really gave my cardio health like improved so much. And of course by weight helped very much. Hopefully we can see all those diet, sleep, exercise, like blood test all in one tab so that we can have a consultation with the AI. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know. I know. Like as soon as we land in France, we're going to be there for a couple of weeks. I'm going to lock the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I'll build like crazy. I'll ship like crazy. &gt;&gt; Okay, then let's go to France and make this bio happen. We're walking to the gate and we have to do our usual routine, &gt;&gt; the daily check. &gt;&gt; When we shoot the Korea vlog, it was 5,000 and we're already 6K almost. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amazing. &gt;&gt; Crazy. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You're going to eat so much. &gt;&gt; How do you feel? &gt;&gt; I'm excited to have some cheese. &gt;&gt; Cheese? You mean my saturated fat? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Look in, man. Just look the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Look at this, man. What is this doing? &gt;&gt; You know, I shipped funnels on that fast and I tested the new headline and new hero section for the entire website to convert more people. So, this is the funnel for 2 weeks before I made the change. And this is the funnel for 2 weeks after the change. The conversion rate from landing page to signing up went from 4.5% to 6.2. I completely changed the hero section and I give interactive demo and I change the entire headline. &gt;&gt; We're final in Paris. &gt;&gt; I'm building an app to leave until 120 years old. At least I hope so. The goal itself is not to leave uh super long. The goal itself is especially to have fun in this journey cuz uh being healthy makes me happy. Being happy is what I thrive for. So I'm building this little thing called bio age which uh tagline is your body's operating system. It's really work in progress. Basically it's an app that has access to my entire health data. So it knows my sleep from my wearables. It knows how much nutrients I intake through snapping photos of my food. It knows uh how well is my exercise going like um through again my wearables. It has access to my biomarkers. So I just upload blood tests here and then it extract them the important ones. And then what I hope will be the core feature of this app is the AI chat. This is basically chipt trained on my own health data as context. It knows again what I eat, what I do, how I sleep, my blood sugar, etc. And I hope that by doing so I will be able to find patterns for some reason. Maybe some days I feel like a little more tired, some days I underperform my workouts, my run, whatever. So for instance, I can ask, do I drink too much coffee? Does it seem to disturb my sleep? And then here I give this AI a bunch of tools. A tool to uh check what is my last night of sleep to uh see sleep patterns for the past 30 days to uh see if there's caffeine uh intake inside of my food intake. There really are a bunch of stuff. It's work in progress. So, as you can see, it's actually terrible. Something might have been wrong here. But I I just hope that after grinding more on this little weekend side project, I will be able to get an AI that is extremely smart, that is trained on all my health context, and able to tell me how to improve my overall health. Judg might kill my startup really soon, but hey, it doesn't matter. I'm having fun building this one, and it's all about enjoying the journey.

[Applause] This is crazy. 5.6%. &gt;&gt; I'm dying. The most painful moment of my life. If things don't change, I will just burn out. &gt;&gt; How much is our MR now? 55K, man. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I am so freaking happy. There is one biomarker to track is V2 max. Let's get a V2 max list. [Music] What is he doing? Mark, what are you doing? I thought you were working. &gt;&gt; You were waiting for that moment. I knew it. Okay, I can explain. &gt;&gt; No, you're busted, man. &gt;&gt; I have a really good excuse. I don't code anymore. AI codes for me. And when I wait for the AI to code, instead of checking my phone, I lift this dumbbell. AI is working and I am lifting. It's a new world, man. Okay. So, AI is my husband now. Okay. I think we have to go. We're about to leave. &gt;&gt; Oh, true. What time is the flight? &gt;&gt; Very soon in few hours. &gt;&gt; Okay. 5 minutes. &gt;&gt; 5 4 3 2 1 Heat. Heat. Oh wow. You can put your stuff inside. &gt;&gt; It's the seats and the luggage at the same time. Viva Korea. &gt;&gt; Viva Korea. And even we can order here. &gt;&gt; Wow. So good. Healthy veggies and protein and bar. &gt;&gt; This is the first Korean meal in the last 6 months. I think &gt;&gt; it's so good. &gt;&gt; It is so good. Yeah. I'm starving and it's hot. So hot outside. We're going to be here for 30 days. &gt;&gt; Your parents are going to take care of us like we're 12 years old. We're going to spoil what is amazing in the cell bar. You can refill all the side dishes here. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. I Korean girl. &gt;&gt; I'm getting into the Korean style with those umbrellas. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You mean you're into Korean skin care, the boy, the sunlight, sunscreen, and the sun umbrella. &gt;&gt; Brian just would be really proud of us. Everybody's wearing umbrellas here. That's true. &gt;&gt; Your parents come back from Norway &gt;&gt; and they're like, "Why are Europeans all the way at midday standing under the on the grass under the strong sun?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hey, feel free to say hi. Hi. Heat. Heat. 1 hour 20. &gt;&gt; 1 hour 20. &gt;&gt; How many kilometers? I don't know cuz it's on my I think 16 or 17 maybe. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's do 50. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. First is my teacher. &gt;&gt; I think about a month ago I wanted to start to train to the gym. And he was like, "Oh, you know, like uh if you're looking for a PT or something, just I'll train you." And he refused any financial incentives or anything. Like he's been literally training me just for free. So that's how kind people are. And we're going to now head over a little session really quick. I'm dying. This is the end. This totally the end. Yeah. one. &gt;&gt; This is horrible. I hate this. We say goodbye to &gt;&gt; He killed He killed me every single time I struggle to walk. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I saw you did all the maximum weight in the machine. &gt;&gt; He's pushing me hard, but just enough. &gt;&gt; Okay, maybe we give a little backstory. So, 30 days ago, we we arrived in Korea and I wanted to get into the gym just to see how that goes. Yeah, because you before you didn't do any weightlifting, so you wanted to learn the perfect form to prevent injuries. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. And I did ch method. So I asked GPT and YouTube videos and I think in the first session he saw me like doing whatever you know, with the weight &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so he he doesn't speak English and I barely speak any Korean, but he started to coach me the first lesson and then he's like, I can actually coach you like twice a week or something. And then in the ended up like he coached me like almost 10 times. is super kind. It's like a free PT. It's amazing. I think it's a good example of Korean people &gt;&gt; like this act of kindness that they would we offered him to pay him for his time like the PT sessions, right? &gt;&gt; He keep denying and really beautiful kindness of Koreans. &gt;&gt; So maybe let's show the results. &gt;&gt; Oh, the weight, the body weight and stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So we did the inbody test to see how much muscles and body fat you want. Can you show me? 4.5 kilogram of fat. That's crazy. You are 5.6% of body fat. Are you a bodybuilder? &gt;&gt; It's crazy, man. Do you think it's really 5.6? &gt;&gt; I mean, your skin is very lean. It shows the body fat level. &gt;&gt; Ah, maybe the the reason it's very different from bodybuilders body &gt;&gt; is because I don't have much muscles. So, it doesn't &gt;&gt; Yeah. They they have way more volume. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. New Zealand 6 months ago, body fat was 11%. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. So that means like I reduce my body fat by half. &gt;&gt; Like if I want to really get muscly, &gt;&gt; I need to eat way more. &gt;&gt; More carbs. &gt;&gt; More carbs. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz so much protein texting liver. So it's not good. &gt;&gt; But at the same time, this kind of like cardio stuff, it's better when you're not kind of lean &gt;&gt; cuz you can run longer, faster. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Uh it's kind of a in between, you know. Actually, talking about V2 max, we have to do a test, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. That was our promise. Oh, let's get a V2 max test. &gt;&gt; I think if there is one biomarker to track is V2 max. &gt;&gt; It tells how much your muscles &gt;&gt; are able to use oxygen that you breathe when you're exosing. It's a good indicators of how fit healthy you are. &gt;&gt; And it's a good predictor of how well your your heart and the rest of your body is aging. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. What is your goal then? What is a good level? &gt;&gt; I think so. Okay. So, we are kind of following Brian Johnson's routine. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; So, our kind of reference point is Brian Johnson, which I think is a 55 elite athletes or around 70 in our age. If you're above 50, I think he's really good. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, I hope we have 50 plus both of us. &gt;&gt; Uh hopefully. &gt;&gt; Hopefully. &gt;&gt; So, not only you to test, we actually did the blood test in Korea. &gt;&gt; Yeah, true. And the funny thing is because I built also apps related to health that I was like wait I need to add a feature where I can upload my blood work tests &gt;&gt; into bio age. And so this is basically how it looks. The book good energy about all the important stuff to track in your health. Those are all the biomarkers the author say to track. And so basically the feature is like you upload your lab test a PDF whatever file and it's going to extract all those bio markers and put it in the little table here give you a glimpse of how good it is for you and then you can see one column equal one lab test and you can see over the month or years how you perform and the idea the big plan is that later on I connect blood work exercise data sleep data food data basically a sort of chachi PT but trained on my own health data &gt;&gt; hopefully Anderson also use it. &gt;&gt; I think he might be working on something similar. He's big into AI and he's definitely the person to go to for when it comes to longevity. So I'm pretty sure he has something planned. &gt;&gt; So on the blood test last year I had over 300 cholesterol level but this year I reduced by half. We're working so hard for our health. So let's see what is our score for the V2 max test. &gt;&gt; Before we do the V2 text max, I cannot not see this. I I cannot talk to you while chewing gum. It's very impolite. So I had to rest my gum on myself. &gt;&gt; And in 3 seconds, me in the most painful moment of my life. &gt;&gt; Very good. view to test. &gt;&gt; I think this is where we go. &gt;&gt; Close to your heart, like right below your chest. &gt;&gt; You know, it's harder than it looks. This was the worst. &gt;&gt; This is what the wor I feel dumb. Okay. Oh, actually it's like 100k all equipment cost. So if you cannot make it, just grab the bar and then keep running and he will decrease the incline and speed. So as soon as you grab the bar, then it's &gt;&gt; okay. Game over. &gt;&gt; Actually, I was thinking my mix. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; you're like a crazy king. Looks like a picture human. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's really you breathe in. Yes. &gt;&gt; Sh. &gt;&gt; Let's start it. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now we're walking quite comfortable pace. Very rarely people make on to seven. So your goal is maybe seven. Oh, it's getting faster. 50 seconds before the stage four. working. &gt;&gt; Ah, good job. You did so well. &gt;&gt; Very good. Very good. &gt;&gt; How was it? &gt;&gt; So hard. &gt;&gt; Yeah. At the end, &gt;&gt; like my uh my brain was getting dizzy, like passing out. &gt;&gt; I think we're not used to climb &gt;&gt; like this. And it's just a killer. So hard. &gt;&gt; And also I don't know maybe cuz I have a massive nose but it presses here. So I end up breathing only with my mouth. &gt;&gt; Ah &gt;&gt; you couldn't breathe with the nose. &gt;&gt; Always the first thing is better to be low so you can see the improve it. &gt;&gt; Yay. Always find the positive side. &gt;&gt; Results in 3 2 1. &gt;&gt; We got the result. What is your view to mix? &gt;&gt; 57. &gt;&gt; Wow. That's so nice. your top three% of the male &gt;&gt; max economy. &gt;&gt; It's a estimated record of your current like a capability to mix and everything. So it looks very nice. &gt;&gt; I could make a marathon in less than 3 hours. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. This &gt;&gt; Wow, it changed. &gt;&gt; This is super interesting. &gt;&gt; We have a theory for this &gt;&gt; is because smartphones people look down so they don't cross the road when it's red. &gt;&gt; I mean, it makes so much sense though like when I see people they all look at their phone like or look at the floor &gt;&gt; and Korea must protect this citizen to compensate with &gt;&gt; population. So, we need to save one more young people. &gt;&gt; Yeah, true. By the way, we haven't done it yet. &gt;&gt; Our daily routine. &gt;&gt; The new daily routine. &gt;&gt; Are you going to check now? &gt;&gt; Should I? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Was it? How much is our MR now? &gt;&gt; Oh No. We were checking data first MR every day when we walk at the end of the day and we're like, "Oh, when do we get 5K?" Because this is very like &gt;&gt; where I spend the last 9 months of my life working on this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wow. Finally 5K man. &gt;&gt; Which means I have to run 5K. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. So Mark will run 5K, 6K, 7K whenever he reach those stage. So &gt;&gt; that's no good. I prefer the 5K MR than the 5K run. I think it's time to get the out of here until people think we're weird YouTubers. Finally, $5,000 monthly recurring revenue for Delafast. And I am so freaking happy. The reason is about 3 months ago, I think it was around May. I was wondering if things don't change, if it doesn't grow a little faster, that I might have to move on because I will just burn out. Cuz I literally spent a year working on Dataf Fast and I felt like it was really slow. The churn was high, the revenue was not growing crazy, but then luckily something happened. So I talked about that in my previous video how this little uh public map globe of uh visitors on site created a little sort of like network effect. It gave customers something to share on social media which get them attention and at the same time it would bring some people to datafast which would grow a little uh customer base. Then around 2 months ago, I started to redesign completely the onboarding for data fast cuz I realized lots of people actually just signed up but never created a website and so I changed the entire onboarding and I learned a lot of stuff. I'll drop a link to a little free article I wrote on my newsletter uh where you can dig into everything I learned. Uh on boarding is very important because that's how you get people from just being uh curious about your product to being interesting and having their attention. And then finally, I think because of the recent feature I shipped, which is especially this one, the funnel part where uh people can see like how people move from steps to step in their the journey for whatever they're trying to achieve. It helps people find bottlenecks and it position data fast not just as uh a nice to have analytics tool, but as a way to find bottlenecks inside of people's marketing funnel. For instance, one thing that I've learned uh this is datafast funnel uh on datafast and it's basically the scroll uh depth of datafast. So that's how far people scroll on my landing page on datafast landing page. And I just saw that uh around 60% of people never even scroll past the hero section. They land on the site and they just drop off right away. So this was a very like huge insight for me and I as well for some customers which I think is one of the reason why datafas grew and what I'm doing right now is because of this number exactly this number precisely this one I am a little frustrated uh so I'm trying to change the hero section of data fast I have a feeling I could write something much better here some people say it's generic so right now I'm focusing more on the marketing side and especially on the literally like the front page the landing page of data fast also I have been working on this very very long series of videos. I will only release that if I actually manage to grow data fast to a million dollar in valuation, which is around $25,000 in monthly recurring revenue. I'm extremely far from being there. But if it happens, if I ever reach my goal, uh I will have all those uh videos uh that I can share that I literally go from whatever kinds of emotion from day I think day one, day two, whatever until uh what whatever date it is now, I think day 331. So that would make an interesting video and I will only get there if I ship a lot of stuff. So now it's time to get back to coding.

Do more crazy things and it will pay off your failures. Now we're in my milk inspector. We're looking for a new home. And this is a proper pet every single day. It took another 7 months to make second million. And now it's your turn off evil. [Music] never work out. Now we're in Mumbai. We just did a developer meetup here. About 200 people came and they're all really nice people trying to change the world with their code. And tonight we're leaving to a new country. I bet Mark is working hard before catching late night flight. So let's see if he's really working. Tissue, we're doing You're not working. You're supposed to work. Sorry. Sorry. It's 3:00 p.m. It's not playing time. Did you make some money? Come sit. Sorry. Very sorry. I needed little break me. Sorry. Wow. I think it's the biggest day for data fast. It's just today. Wow, that's nice. I'm forgiven. Okay, so my middle cow is back to work. We're about to leave to a special place because we are looking for a new house and this looks like a really good place for Mark to focus on work surf nice organic food of course for the milk cow and nice gym as well. We're going to pack the bag and then go to figure out how it goes. The startup office in the backpack and we can go LMG. Let's take the flight. Hello. Thank you. Thank you. We just made it to France. We're looking for a new home, a new place for the startup office, a new place to leave after Bali. And obviously France is it's La France. It's my hometown. There's a bunch of cheese. There's surf. We're going to stay here for about a month to see if that's a good place to live. I just woke up and I realized I have a little surprise for my wife. It took me 7 years to make 1 million online and it took another 7 months to make the second million. Don't give up. During those seven years, there hasn't been a single day without workout. A workout every single day. That's the key to keep grinding for seven years. I'm um I'm almost done with this book. It is the most practical book for any entrepreneur who is trying to make money online. It's packed with a bunch of strategies to help you get started. And I cheated a little bit. I went through the end of the book and I read this quote. You cannot lose if you don't quit. Now the thing is to win it might take a few years. So how do you not quit when you're not winning and for that you have to get results quickly. Now getting results is also hard. Now getting results feels like validation as an entrepreneur. But to get results quickly the one of the easiest way is to do what Alex mentioned in the book which is using cold emails. And this strategy is what I used initially to make my first dollar on the internet and grow a little software business to 4,000 in monthly recurring revenue. This is the best thing you can do because you get instant results. Like you can literally send 100 cold emails today and get a market feedback on whether or not your offer is good. You'll learn about marketing psychology. And when you start winning, you will have something that you can share on social media where you have people willing to listen to what you have to offer. But you have to start with something that is very boring and cold emails is one of the easiest way to get started. What you could actually do is to copy an existing B2B business and you make an offer that is literally impossible to refuse. Every business wants to hire better talents. Every business want to get more customers. Every business owners want to have more time on their hands. So if you make any offer along these lines, you cannot go wrong. Read the book, start sending cold emails, start getting results, and everything will be easier. And now it's your turn. Off you go. I just prepared amazing meal for my cow and he just arrived the perfect time. So moo moo. Yeah. So this morning we did a bio age test and guess what? How old is he? They say 23 and they are super right. Wow. You already know the answer. So he's 23. I'm 30 and to be honest I feel very competitive. Like even though I'm one year older I am like biologically 7 years older than him. Like analyze my result and Oh you prepared play the whole like problem. Why? Basically, as a small person, I overtrained too much because I wanted to keep up with him and it gave me too much training and also I had too much LDL, the bad cholesterol. So, we try to eat less animal protein, less saturated fat, cheese, and also eat more plant-based protein, especially light dinner because when you eat a lot before sleeping, your sleep quality will be really low. And why not? This is the perfect setup for taking care of my cow as a A++ rating. Some of our friends roast us for eating tofu. But actually tofu is full of proteins and all the LDL cholesterol that you have in the meat is not there. So we try to do is we try to have like a meat, eggs and fish for lunch and more like tempered tofu for dinner. Yeah. And we also increase the zone four five cardio. That's why Mark was running. So V2 is the most important um health indicator. We were actually going to test this week or next week but roughly oop said I'm 54 56 and oh that's good. I started running few months ago from Korea and I my view to make increase so much and yeah be consistent. Consistent is the key. It's very it's super interesting like I'm grateful you take care of all those stuff. It's actually it's hard for everybody to do it. I think one of the way to actually do something is to test yourself, look at the data and just face what's the average data for people of your age. That for me was like a a wakeup call. You can do a blood test, you can wear a sleep tracker and you know how much deep sleep and REM sleep you get. You can like um invite your family, friends to do the healthy competence together so you don't feel lonely and yeah, it's really this conversation is never going to end. You know that. Yeah. Okay. So, that's it. That's it. That's it. I think I just found a way to steadily grow my new little startup. Let me show you something. So, this is the past 3 months data for one of my little product called Dataf Fast. And as you can see with the monthly breaking growth, it's like growing around 15 to 20% month over month. and it's kind of steady which I think I found a little something a few months ago maybe four months ago I built this uh map where I can see visitors on my website but I make it in a way that is kind of new like you have this globe you can go around you can click on people see what they do on your site I even added a little loi station to the real time map I would not call it this as a painkiller feature but this is more sharable and since I am in a business where there are lots of uh competitors web analytics is a tough business and people don't really want to pay for web analytics. But with this uh little feature, I'm getting a new stream of users on a daily basis. I see bunch of tweets of people sharing their own globe on Twitter like this tweet and a bunch of others and people ask how did you get this globe? And they would of course plug uh my little startup which would bring me traffic. So somehow my users are doing marketing for me. And I think here there's a little lesson where even if you're in a crowded tough market, if you copy something that exists already, you're pretty sure it's going to work at some point because if it's working, people are already paying money for these kind of problems. So it's validated. And on top of that, if you plug your own signature, if you find a way to make this famous product special with your own touch, then maybe you will land on something. This little uh map project was born on a random Sunday. I had no idea. I just I didn't want to work on my typical day basis. I just wanted to randomly try vibe coding a few stuff and somehow this little feature is one of the best marketing channel for my product. So maybe just try some random stuff. Just rebuild an existing business and add your own signature. And who knows, maybe in a few weeks from now you will find a little something that will make your users do your own marketing and you will never have to do marketing again. Someone mentioned that I should add a casting option on the TV. And I realized there is a casting option on Google Chrome. And now I can have this huge massive screen showing my web analytics in real time in my living room. Isn't it amazing? I don't really like coding, but I just love the fact that I can turn my ideas into reality. Recently on my YouTube channel, I made this a video where I'm wearing a cure code t-shirt where if people scan it, they go to my site and if they buy it, I'll know it because I'm tracking them. And I was hoping that these little experiments could help me be healthy by walking 10,000 steps per day while technically doing a little bit of marketing. We went to India, we went to Paris, we went to Singapore wearing the t-shirt and for about 7 days, we made a bunch of B-rolls with a camera and I spent another 3 days editing this video myself. So that's a 10 days of work. I posted on YouTube and it was the biggest flop ever for all my videos. It hurts. It really hurts cuz it's 10 days of work. And also we thought it was a interesting angle and you're going you thought like oh it's going to work but the high expectation like more pain especially when you're getting started. This is what you're used to. You spend so much time working on something that does not work and you ship it. Whether it's a video, whether it's a startup, whether it's a tweet, and then just nothing happens. And this is so painful here. But I know if I keep putting little bits out there, at some point one will work and it will outsize all the previous ones that did not work. That will make the entire journey worth it. So keep shipping, make lots of bets, and few of the big success will compensate for a lot of failure. So do more crazy thing, do different things. This is a proper pep talkman. This is a Tony Robbins style of pep talk. What is the take away from this? In one sentence, what would be the takeaway? Do more crazy things and you will pay off your failures. Keep shipping. What are you doing? I don't know. I'm Of course, he will not stop walk without crazy things.

TITLE: I Tried a Strange Marketing Trick and Made $___
VIDEO ID: r45n3Jsqu6o
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r45n3Jsqu6o
================================================================================

So, this is the dumbest marketing experiment I've tried. This is my t-shirt. On the back, there is a cure code. When people scan it, they go to my website and if they buy my product, I make money. Well, that's the perfect plan. So, I just wore this t-shirt and travel the world. I wore it in the busy streets of Mumbai. I wore it in shopping malls in Singapore in the plane. People stared, people laugh. One guy took a selfie with me and run away. At some point, I just became a walking ad and the sidewalk was my funnel. The real question is, can this dumb ideal actually make money? First, I had to pick the right product. I have built over 30 businesses. Some are SAS, some are marketplaces, and some were built during a personal crisis. But most of them don't make money. So, I picked Codefast, my course that teaches people how to learn how to code. Because it has lots of positive reviews, because it converts well, and because it has a broad audience. A random tourist in Paris is more likely to want to learn how to code than reduce Stripe chargebacks. Then, I had to create the cure code. I made a link that points to my course with a little tracking tag at the end. That way, I could use datafast to see exactly who scanned it, how long they stayed, and if they actually bought my course. Datafast is like Google Analytics except that it doesn't require a PhD to understand. I added some text to the cure code because when you tell people not to do something, they usually do it. And then I slap the image on a custom t-shirt. In Indonesia, it only costs $10 to create those custom shirts, but I made a mistake and I just ordered one. At this point, I had the product, I had the funnel, I just had to do marketing. So, I went to Singapore. I walked through a mall, train station. I even went to the Apple store because if someone spent $3,000 on the laptop, they might as well spend $200 for a course. And nothing happened. Not a single visitor. Maybe scanning a stranger's back is not a thing after all. So, I went to India. Totally different vibes. People were curious, friendly. Some even asked for selfies. I walked through Lindmark, food markets, pack street, and people scanned. A lot of people scanned. And that's when I realized two things. Number one, I should have printed more than one t-shirt, especially in a tropical weather of Mumbai. And number two, the funnel was broken. I wasn't a guy promoting a product anymore. I had become an ad that does not convert. I had to increase the conversion rate. So, I snapped a photo of me, removed the background, and with a little bit of code, I added a pop-up to the site only for people who scan with a cure code. The idea was to make people feel like this page was built just for them. I hope this would change that. So I flew to France, walked 20,000 step, got many people scanning me and still no sales. If you want people's attention, pay for it. So I decided to run ads, my kind of ads. I would give people $1 so they can scan my back and I would pitch my product. I made a cardboard and traded my bills for coins. I carried everything to the EFL Tower and it felt awkward. People stared, but no one scanned. probably because scam me really looks like scam me or probably because my shirt says the exact opposite of what the cardboard says. So I started talking first, waving the coin and smiling and suddenly people started scanning and for $1, I got to pitch my product. I talked to tourists, families and even a smart kid with this moment and most of them were German. I have no idea why and I watch it happen on real time on data fast. People scanning me and lighting up the globe. After two hours, I gave away all my coins and then suddenly where someone what the here yolo yolo I saw one sale $299. Yes, I did it. But then I remembered I tweeted a photo of myself at the EFL Tower earlier that day and the person bought under a company name. So I had no way to trace back to a person I talked to. It could have been Twitter and not the street. Suddenly I felt like the whole challenge was broken. In the taxi to go back home, I had mixed feelings. The driver noticed the cardboards in my hand and asked what we were doing in Paris. We chatted for a bit, and when we arrived home, he asked if he could check the course. He scanned my bag, read the landing page, pulled his credit card, and right in front of me, he bought it. He's from Benin, Africa. He drives a taxi in Paris, where running a pork farm back home, and he wants to build a website to sell the meat online. That was the moment. I thought that tweet ruined everything, but I wasted weeks on a challenge that would never work. But the taxi made it real again. Don't wait for everything to be perfect. Just put your work out there. It might be awkward. It might flop. And then out of nowhere, it might just work.

[Music] To make $1 million in profit, you need $1.2 million in revenue with the digital product. And you need 20 million in revenue with the restaurant. This is where I'm going to lock in gym code. Gym code review. We should have used typescript. There has never been a better time in history to build digital products. Let's shoot. This ad is so good. Time for serious business. What if I die? Just shoot it. Meet Mark Lou, a millionaire who owns exactly zero pairs of shoes and way more startups than you'd think is reasonable. He sits here in this disgustingly beautiful tropical paradise to show you how to turn ideas into brands, strangers into clients, and your boring job into a distant memory. 5 4 3 2 1. So, we're on the way to the next Airbnb and we're sad to leave especially. Yeah, it was such a beautiful place. Oh, wow. The bridge is built. That's unreal color. Which direction are we going? Are we going this way or or that way? I'm I'm not so sure which way we're going. Baboo. So healthy. We bought the salmon from the mom cook. 500 g. Lots of protein. Feels so muscle. All right, so we just landed in a new place in New Zealand. We're lost in the middle of absolutely nowhere, which I guess is good because there's no other distraction than this as I have a brand new feature I need to ship for data fast. So I guess this is where I'm going to lock in gym code gym code repeat. So this is what we're going to do. You're the coach today. There's no surf in New Zealand where we are. So, this is the first time doing a crossfit session with a wife. Go. There's no legacy if I drop this. Oh, no. Oh, it's hard. It's just a momentum and skill. Yeah, I didn't get it. Time to code. We are going to take a killer thumbnail for the New Zealand vlog and we are going to move this swing to the middle of the road. It's not a bad office. I just wish I could see something on my screen. I'm going to get cancelled. Okay, look at that. Wow. 200 g grass-fed beef from New Zealand. They have the best life until they got eaten by him. So good. Oh, we catch this little bird. She came through the window. It's like a little indie hiker just starting the journey and we want to wish him good luck. Just ship it. Ah, she stays here. Maybe she loved us. Bye-bye, pretty bird. It's 1000 p.m. There's absolutely no one around and we can see all the stars. It is so beautiful. Time to go to bed. Good morning. It is Sunday morning and there's nothing I like better than a coffee and a book. This is what I am reading at the moment. The breakthrough experience. Usually I have this approach for hopefully almost everything where it's either a hell yeah or no. So if I uh really like the book then I'm going to keep reading. If it's meh then I'm just going to go for another book. This one I don't know. I still really don't know. But at the same time I'm like just keep digging. I guess if it makes it in another video then it's probably a hell yeah book. Good Good Good [Applause] Breakfast time. The point when you move airplanes too often you find so much time opening 2 hours straight. You're dirty. Daily workout with the wife. Let's go. Do you think anyone? 30 minutes of workout per day, 30 minutes of coding, 30 minutes of marketing. Do this every single day of the year in 2025 will be freaking amazing. New Zealand is so beautiful. A man, this ad is so it's so good. I was bored today and I didn't want to code. So instead, I made an ad and I used AI for that. So here's the thing. A couple days ago, I saw this ad on Instagram. Like literally, it was in my feed. It's a it's a French dude who is promoting his restaurants and I was like, "This is a really good ad." And it's also extremely simple to make. You just need an iPhone to record that. And so I try to make the same thing for my ad. Let me show you what I come up with. People always ask me, "Hey Jordan, how do you invest your money?" I don't know. My name is not even Jordan, it's Mark. But what I know is this. The best investment you can make is learn how to code and build your own tiny internet business. And now with AI, it's easier than ever. So check out codefast.no and start coding today. This literally took 45 minutes to make because I already know like this ad format works. It's a very simple script. I use AI to rewrite the initial script. So I I took the script from that Instagram ad. I put it to AI. I describe the product I'm selling. And then I asked the AI to keep the same short format and write it for my own product. Then I asked my wife to shoot me and do my weird stuff. And I use this little u website here um Sub Magic. You just upload your video and then they add those uh like sexy thumbnails onto your video which make it more dynamic. I think this is for Instagram so it needs to move a little bit. And now I'm I'm lucky that I have a good friend of mine, Nico. You might have seen him in some of my previous videos. He's also an indie hacker. He used to manage um high budget, not like mine, like really high budget uh ads for like software and stuff. So he's really good at it and he's going to help me like with the targeting on Facebook and Instagram to make sure that you know the ad is seen by the right people. If that works, I will just report in those videos what I get from those ads. I really had no idea that today would be an ad day. I really don't like marketing. But when it becomes fun like this where it's like a very short tiny thing, I make a video that is hopefully fun. I come up with like weird ideas. One point here is if you ever see an ad that looks fun and it's quite easy to make, try to replicate that ad. Use the format they use because if you're seeing the ad, it means they're spending decent money. So it means that the ad somehow is working. take that ad, ask the AI to make the copyrightiting and the part that you you don't know and try to sell it somewhere on Instagram, Facebook, or just post the video on your own Instagram and see how that goes. A nice uh time for serious business. Today is a little bit of a special day. Not only because this is probably one of the most beautiful place I've ever stayed, but also because what if I die? Like I'm French and my company is in Singapore. I have a local director and there's a little over a million dollar in cash in the company. How do I make sure that my wife gets everything if something happened to me? So, I'm doing some boring legal stuff, but uh now I have my friend Chajipy who is going to I guess make my life much easier. In Singapore, company shares do not automatically transfer to a spouse upon death. Instead, they're handled through succession, laws, a will, and legal documents. I get some paperworks, I guess. Okay, I guess I uh I found this um this lawyer company or whatever this is. They have a little button to message them on WhatsApp, which is something I love about Asia. You can do everything on WhatsApp. I send them a a WhatsApp and uh I mentioned the fact that I want my wife to own everything if something happens to me. I know this is kind of an awkward question, but I was thinking I've been working hard for six years to create this thing and my wife has been my co-founder somehow. Like mentally, she's been here all the time. And I think she deserves to get every single beats that's left if I were to disappear. And I want to make sure that there's no friction for her to get it like having to fight in court or something like this. That took me 5 minutes. Uh maybe that will take me another 30 minutes later and probably cost me $1,000 worth of lawy lawyer things, but at least I know that if anything happens, she has some sort of peace and will get all the rewards of, you know, all the things she's been she's been through because I would have never be able to make any of this without my wife. Um a No, but actually I'm a bit emotional at the moment. Oh, I think that's so good. It almost looks like it's a bye-bye, you know, like no, you're not going to die tomorrow. No, we'll sign a contract with a lawyer that says, you know, if anything happens, you will get everything of the company. Doesn't happen. Oh, no. Thank you for doing it just in case. You know, we never know, man. I'm just walking down the street and then there is one of those seagull who on me. He goes into my eyes, he gets infected. Boom. Death. All right. I don't really feel like working at the moment. So, why not taking a day off and enjoy this beautiful view? It's going up now. Woke up in a country lane. Don't know what happened. I don't know how I came to be at the end of my world with going up in smoke. Just watch your bra. Hey, you say all things don't go my way. Get me. All I have to do today is to build a bunch of features user requested. Life doesn't get any better than that. Yes, this is the best time of the day. I think I shipped around six features all requested by my customers. That's very important. Let me show you this. This is it. Those like this little card here is where I display all the new features that I've shipped on the app. And um most of them come from this one. So, I collect feedback from my customers. And one of the most requested feedback was I want to exclude renewal revenue from uh my metrics. So first thing what I did is I now split the revenue into two categories. The new revenue and the recurring revenue usually coming from subscriptions or recurring customers. And so it's quite subtle but the color like there's different shades of orange here to uh differentiate which is new which is renewal. And then I've created a little setting where people can turn off these like renewal uh revenue included into their KPIs. And so this revenue per visitor will include or not include the recurring revenue. And because shipping is fun, I also include in refunds. So um now in gray color, uh if like a payment was refunded, then it's going to be shown in gray. And the revenue will of course not be included in the revenue per visitor. And finally, the last update I made, I think this one is more for me. Um I was really curious what happens when people visit my site but don't purchase on the first day. For instance, for this person, I know that they found my website through Beehive, so likely my newsletter, and they did not make a purchase on the day they viewed the site. And I was really curious like when they make a purchase or the next days, where do they find my site? Do they click a tweet? Do they click do they go on Google? Whatever. And now I can see I added like this little line where I can see the new referral. And so now I know that this person found through my newsletter on the first day. And then when he they came back by typing codefast on Google. If you're a user of datafast, I hope you'll like this new update. We're going from Christ Church to Timaru. In Christ Church, we're so busy we couldn't make much YouTube video. Instead, you made like masterpiece. Is it a masterpiece? I hope so. So, what is that video? It's one of the questions people ask me the most often is like, how would you learn to code again now that there is AI? This is kind of like the road map I had for codefast. It's like I highlight to you all the steps you need to go from zero to coding a SAS and coding faster with AI. And uh it's about 3 hours long, but the comments people who watch this videos like they it's extremely helpful and man that's that's it goes straight to my heart because I spent so much time making this video. I'm very happy that it's helpful and some people watch it and you know learn how to cook with it. This is the video Mark was working on for how long? 3 weeks. 3 weeks. So basically the video is it walks you through the first step which is like understanding how the the internet works the fundamentals. Then we go through building an entire software from zero. So complete beginner teaching the basics of like what is an API, what is front end, what is a back end, how do you make a landing page, how to create a dashboard, what is a database and then the end of the video is mostly how I use AI to code faster. Definitely if you want to learn code just check it out like in 3 hour you can learn everything what you need to learn. I'll put it in the card. This is a really beautiful place. I think I want this in our house. So, does it make you creative? This makes me creative. What did you find? This I was stuck. I think I found something. I want to know what you think. The thumbnail for the video like I use the movie split different personality like seven versions of me. When you click, there's like 5 to 10 seconds of play and you're like playing the movie Split and then after a little glitch and be like, "All right." And then explain the video like intro. Like maybe there could be like a programmer that is worried that AI is going to replace them and there's another programmer who's like uh not at all like you know that doesn't make any sense. I want to play those two characters. I think I found it. I found it. This will be the background. Okay. We have to make sure we leave this Airbnb and publish this video after the host reviewed us. Otherwise they will be like who the are those weirdos? All right. So I I uh ditched the previous book. Sorry Mr. de Martin, but I just I don't know. I didn't connect and I started this new book, The Expectation Effect. This is a book that was recommended on Twitter from Alex, a really good guy. His entire Twitter account is dedicated to recommending books that he loves. And uh this is excellent. It's fun because I've read just one page and I knew instantly that this was a book for me. It's hard to explain why, but it was like a clear yes. This is probably we are this house we have been everything is super old. You have this like savana animal. I need to show other weird stuff. This I mean it's not weird in itself. It's just weird as a part of this Airbnb where you have like spiritual stuff, old stuff, new stuff. Like inside you have this thing. I mean to be honest, yeah, there I want to remember those moments. Oh wow. Oh wow. So beautiful. I want to take a photo. Okay, we have to take a photo of this. So over the rain. This is the thumbnail I was working on yesterday. I hope it was worth it. And today is a video recording day. This uh video should be on YouTube a week before or after this vlog. I hope you like the video, too. Let's shoot. Bro, stop coding. What? AI is getting so good. They they they say it's going to replace us. Replace us. We've built an entire company just using AI. Customer support for Startup 13. How can I help you today? Why does everything has to be blue? And someone delete the fishing email. We are so screwed here. We don't offer refunds. I'm sorry. We need to change the border radius here. We We should have used TypeScript. Hello. Boom. Oh no, guys. We need a meeting right now. Did AI just turned me into a manager? Let there be guitar. All right, boy. Let there be rock. Let there be coffee. New Zealand is so beautiful. It's crazy. It's really beautiful. Like even the sunrise, this just the sun itself is is beautiful. This is very interesting. It's a study about the effect on placeos on relieving Parkinson disease. And it's really fun to see that the price of the drug people will pay to be healed will impact how they will be healed. It basically says that the higher they pay for the the peel, the higher the results they will get, which is really fun cuz it's super tied to what we do. I think I see a lots of developers often making this mistakes of pricing their products too cheap. Um, when you're getting started, I know it's tricky to ask for people money on the internet, but it's very important to price accurately because just the price itself without even seeing the product reflects on how good people will think the product is. It's called perceived value and unlike the actual product where it needs a lot of work, you can just, you know, increase just a little bit your pricing to make it seems like it's a better product. Of course, the product after has to deliver the value, but uh it's usually a mistake that I see developers make by pressing a little too cheap when they're getting started. And if you have no idea how to start with your pricing, the best is to look at what competitors are doing and price just a little higher or look at other industries and applies what they do for yours. Back to this masterpiece. What are you reading? The same book as you. Do you like it so far? I absolutely loved it because life is all about dealing with expectation to yourself to the other. Same as atomic habit. If you make the identity that you believe who you are, then you will behave in certain way to do so. Even though you're not the person yet, if you believe like you're a good entpreneur, you're a good runner, you're a good, you know, friend, then you will do your best to, you know, be become like that. If you're not inspired after this pep talk. All right, that's enough for today. Uh, this is a really good book. Now, time for workout luggage packing and we are going to a new place where there some workout is the second best legal drug on the planet after sleep. Take one dose daily. Side effect might include occasional flexing in the mirror. It's 9:20 a.m. 22 minutes of a heavy workout, intense workout, and I'm set for the day. Airbnb check out is in 20 minutes. And uh on the road again. The best electronic backpack no one talks about. Getting dirty. This is so heavy. Making YouTube videos is a workout. Let's go. We're finally arrived. Finally. Here we go, mate. Let's see what color it is. Yes, sir. Surprise. Wow, we just entered the paradise. Welcome Denmark. Okay, I think this is the most unexpected like out of what we are normally used to Airbnb. Okay, are you ready? Just look around. Just look around. Wow, the view. Every morning we're going to have coffee while watching this amazing view. I feel like I'm in an old man's house. And this is such a dream. Imagine you have a little door that leads to the ocean. Yeah. So nice. There are seals everywhere. Yeah, exactly. This is so nice. Yeah, this one looks dead. There are like one that I freaking love nature. It's so beautiful. That's true. It makes me so happy to be next to them. I think we can also walk on the rings later when it's low tide. She was scratching her head. Yeah. With her weird like legs. Oh, actually they don't do Careful. breakfast. All right. Oh, it's time to get some work done. And today I'm doing my favorite activity of the year, accounting. But I'm not doing the accounting myself. Uh I have an accountant doing it for me. I'm just reviewing the profit and loss statement, making sure that uh everything is right. My P&amp;L should be somewhere around this video. It's in Singapore dollars. It's the total revenue for all of my sources of income. I think I have somewhere around like 10 sources of income in total. And when doing the P&amp;L, I was surprised that the revenue is around I think $1.5 million in Singapore dollars. And the profit was 1.2 Singapore and Singapore dollars, which is around 80% profit margin. And I'm not the type of guy who cut corners. So I I am really easy peasy on the bills and stuff. I don't try to save money. I try to make more money instead. So I could optimize those profit margin. And I was still thinking 80% profit margin knowing that I have no meetups. I have uh no ownership. I don't owe anything to anyone. I'm not renting a place. I don't manage um employees. I don't have like payrolls at the end of the year or something. And that made me think of a little story back in 2016 when I was working as a waiter. I was earning around $10 per hour and I was working 10 hours a day. So, at the end of the day, I would be paid $100 and I would bring to the business around $2,000. I know that because at the end of the day, we had to count all the bills and tell the business owner how much money uh we made on the day. And back in that restaurant, there were around five waiters at a time. And so I was thinking like this business owner sells around $10,000 per day worth of food. Of course, there's ingredient, the rental, the cook to pay. But I was still thinking like that's around $300,000 per month or $3.6 million per year. This guy, the owner, might be freaking rich. I really wanted to know how much money he makes by the end of the year. But because we were in France, it's kind of like it's it's a bit of a taboo topic. You don't ask someone how much money you're making. So I tried to ask without asking and he told me it's not what do you think it is. I never really understood until today where I asked Chadip what is the average profit margin for a restaurant and I figured out that if he wants to make the similar amount of money that I made in 2024 with a restaurant you need to make $20 million. And here I am with my little $1.5 million in revenue. Those two businesses are making the same profit by the end of the year. And on top of that, there's no risk that one of my employee cuts his finger while cutting a piece of meat. I'm not going to injure typing on my keyboard. And this made me realize that for the same output, the input is completely different. To make $1 million in profit, you need $1.2 million in revenue with the digital product, and you need 20 million in revenue with the restaurant. For instance, this little product made $15,000 last year. It cost around $2 to $3 a month to send emails and it runs for like $10 a month. So that's roughly 95% profit margin. Or you can create a product with the name poop in it makes a couple hundred a month and this cost $0 a month to maintain. Or this little software that makes $2,000 a month and it cost less than $10,000 to run per month. So roughly all of my tiny software product have around 95% profit margin. And on top of this, I don't need to do much customer support. My products are running 24/7. The take away from this is profit is not revenue. And with a digital product, you don't need to hit crazy numbers in order to pay for your living. And now it has never been a better time in history to build something. With AI coming up with great marketing ideas, helping you coding and build those products. Now is the time. Or be like this guy and don't give a about life in whatsoever way. It's working. Oh, he's it like this. Is what a sea seal looks like. And this is a post face. Yes. Relieved. Yes. So relieved.

TITLE: How I Would Learn to Code in 2025 (if I had to start over)
VIDEO ID: k4Zpe6u1rLI
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4Zpe6u1rLI
================================================================================

coding is easy the hard part is knowing what to learn and most importantly what to skip in the next few minutes I am going to show you exactly what you need to know in order to build any online business my name is Mark I have built those 30 tiny internet businesses and I'm now financially independent if you start today you could be making money online with a digital product in just a few weeks so stay with me okay so the number one mistake people make when they're learning how to code is they want to go too fast and use those great AI tools to build a website yes you can input a little bit of English is going to create a beautiful site for you but this is misleading if you want to add more features if you want to fix bugs you will have no idea what to tell the AI because you need to know the fundamentals of the internet in order to be able to instruct an AI to code for you so we want to start first with the fundamentals and for that of course we're going to use AI but not to code but to explain us how the internet works the first part is understanding how the internet works as a consumer you right now browsing YouTube you are an internet consumer what I would do very first is to go to chat GPT and just explain me what is happening when I visit whatever website your favorite website.com ask CH GPT to not use any technical skills and to explain this simply using metaphors try to understand the the the overall journey of what happens when you visit a websites then you will want to learn the fundamental concepts internet browser HTTP URL DNS those are some of the Core Concepts of the internet the entire internet relies on those Concepts to try to learn what each of them is doing without getting too much into details but just the overall The Core Concepts and again here you want to use tgpt to explain you exactly what it is and then to have a pick at what's next open the developer console just like this and inspect any website and over the elements and try to you know just get curious of what you actually see as a developer the next part is to understand internet as a developer what do you have to do as a developer so that your website is seen by millions of people across the world first you will need to install a code editor you have vs code you have cursor AI the which are great editors and then you want to build web pages if you have completed the previous step you now know what a web page is and you want to learn those three languages HTML CSS and JavaScript one more time any website you see on the internet is made with those three languages you don't want to go too deep you want to learn just 10% of each of those languages just enough in order for you to build a tiny web page that you could send to a friend it could be just your portfolio website that could be just a landing page for your future business idea it doesn't matter you can build anything with h HML CSS and JavaScript for each of those three languages I added some of the core components you want to learn so for instance you want to learn what are HTML links inputs button Etc HTML is used as a structure of a page CSS is mostly like to style things so uh properties like colors display margin padding Etc are important to learn and JavaScript you used to make a web page interactive like uh pressing buttons like double clicking on here for instance don't overthink it just learn the minimum you need to build a little web page and show it to a friend by by the way if you need this road map I'll add a link in the description so that you can uh follow along with me and whenever you're done learning one of those elements you can just uh double tap and I think it will save your progress okay now we are entering the fun part you're watching this video probably because you want to build an online business you so you will need a landing page to present your idea you will need a probably like a private user dashboard so people can do stuff like update their profile or download files and probably a way to send emails and charge payments we're going to cover all that in this section and the first thing you want to do is to pick a text tack this is my text tack uh I use the this these tools and products and libraries in order to uh build my 30 websites for instance I use Daisy UI as a component library to style my websites I use OJs to authenticate users I use data fast to track web analytics now you may be wondering why we're not using pure HTML JavaScript and CSS and the answer is just because of the speed you want to ship apps fast to the market you could technically build anything with HTML and CSS but as developers we are we are lazy and so it's better to use a text tag like react to build UI components instead of writing them in pure HTML JavaScript and CSS as a quick example uh if you want to make just a button with a counter where when you press it increase the counter by one this is what you would have to do using HTML and JavaScript but if you're using react this library in order to build user interface you would just have to write this in other word having a text tack will help you ship faster there's a big misconception especially on YouTube where people will try to make you feel like you're missing out if you don't try the the newest UI library or the latest reactjs version or something this is pure procrastination what you want to do is you pick one text Tack and you stick to it forever uh if you want you can just copy mine this is a very popular text tack you don't have to use all the third party tools I'm using here uh a lot of them are have like a specific use case and we're going to cover that later okay once you have your Tex tack you need to get just a little comfortable with the terminal the terminal is this little app that is installed already on your computer that lets you navigate with your computer but as a developer there are four commments here that I think are important to know and again Ask chpt to explain you real quick what is the terminal and how to use it then you're going to have to set up your computer so that depends on the text you've picked of course for this video I'm going to pretend you've picked the exact same text tack as me first you'll need to install nodejs so it lets you run JavaScript everywhere then you want to also install nextjs which is like a framework that's going to uh compile and combine all of your pages that we're going to serve to the client and if you haven't already you will need a code editor and then you will have an entire project up and running at this point you want to understand a little bit of what is going on because this uh nextjs thing is going to install a bunch of stuff so let's uh you know step by step break down what is on your machine so first you will have access to a package manager called npm it's basically a bunch of uh libraries and free stuff that other developers have built that you can reuse for instance this is one of my websites and you can see here there's a beautiful chart that changed colors Etc I did not create this chart by myself I am using a library called rechart and this library is available on npm you want to understand a little bit of how npm works you are basically two things you have a package.json which is like the kind of the control center of your app which you will find right here in your project and you have two commands npm install to install a package npm run to run a script another big part is the linter called es L if I go back to my code and I make a typo I remove these brackets then I will see red colors it's because I have a l basically a little program that runs on my machine that tells me when I make mistakes as a developer so I make just less mistakes you also want to understand a little bit about how the next chest architecture works so as you can see here in this project I have a bunch of folders I have app components data uh you might have less than this because this is an actual project where I built stuff on it but you will probably have the app folder and a few other files uh you want to ask chpt to explain you a little bit of how this works a quick tip here what you can do is you can ask an AI inside of your code editor uh to explain you what this or that does okay the next one is the version control system so there are two major components to that there is a GitHub GitHub is basically Google Drive for developer so this is for instance my profile on GitHub those are all the repository so all the projects I work on you want to create an account and this is where you're going to start pushing code and to push code to upload your code you'll need to use gits so you need to install gits then you want to learn the very basic of gits G add git commit git push that's all all you need to know in order to use Git it can get really complex so just learn those ones and git is going to help you make versions of your codes whenever you make an update on your ad you can write a little message and then you push this update and it will be pushed automatically to GitHub okay now you have a little understanding of your project you want to move on and you want to start building a landing page you want to start with the visual part things that you can send to friends that people can see because it's the I mean at least for me it is the funniest part so there are three major components when you're building a landing page with this modern text tack one is react react is a library that is going to help us build interative user interactions like user interface um those are of the core concept of react that I think you should be learning and these are some a little Advanced JavaScript concept that you haven't learned previously that you will have to learn as well to uh use react properly nextjs is a wrapper like a it's a framework around react it's going to organize all your pages and files Etc one more time here you want to learn just the minimum you need to build something um this is for instance what our react hooks are you will learn that later um there are around 20 of them I built 30 websites using the three hooks only so you really really really don't need to learn everything okay and the final component The Styling part is done with Tailwind CSS uh this is what you would find in Project like this where you would write semantic classes in order to style your app and on top of it I use the daisy UI component Library so this little website here where uh they give you a bunch of components like those uh toggle checkbox uh cards Etc I want my uh website designed to always look similar I don't want to design everything from scratch and so Daisy UI gives me access to a bunch of components once you build a little something to present you want to deploy your site on the internet I use versal to host all of my websites for instance those are all of my projects on versal and this is what it looks like as a workflow so you as a developer work on your computer you git commit and git push your changes which will be uploaded to GitHub and then when uh there is a new update on GitHub they're going to update versal your server on the internet and versal is going to run some comments and to deploy redeploy your new website uh you will see it is actually extremely simple and by the way I am not paid by versal or any of the other uh tools I promote in this video this is not a sponsored video those are just the tools I use for myself and finally you will want to get a domain name that's the funniest part as a developer you I use name sh to my domain names if for some reason the Doom is not available for your idea which is likely to happen because they're all taken um it doesn't matter yeah you don't need to have aom TLD aom extension in order to make money on the internet just try to buy a domain name that is easy to read and makes sense and congratulation you can already build a front page you can add a pay button and you can already make money on the internet now you might want to do some more advanced stuff like saving users in database downloading things Etc this is where the backend notion comes in place a back end is basically all the things that are not visible to visitors of your site one of the most common use of backend is API endpoint an API endpoint is basically like a little door where you can send information you can save that someone click on your site you can uh create a checkout link you can save a user in the database it all starts with an API endpoint some developers are using different framework and even different languages to create API endpoints but since we're using next JS for our project you can just create an entire API endpoint using the SLA SL API folder if you can just create a file named route. JS in this folder you will have created an API endpoint and congrats you are a backend developer so you will learn some of the fundamentals concept we talked about earlier what is an HTTP method what is what are htttp parameters and how to return a respond from this API endpoint there are also some Advanced JavaScript uh things you will have to learn because then it brings the notion of asynchronous when you call an API the request has to go through the internet you don't know how long that takes so uh that's why we have to um handle those cases with JavaScript async weight and promises and if you want to haveen you can also call another API not your own API but someone else for instance chpt has an API uh you can uh get started in just a few minutes and you can for instance just use this little piece of code in order to call the chbt API now having an API endpoint is nice but you likely want to do something with this API endpoint and one of the most common uh use of a back end is to have a database they store some information for my database I use a nosql database it's mongodb it's hosted on mongodb Atlas so this little website here they have a free plan so you can create a little cluster like a little mini database for free and because I'm lazy and I want to visualize my database on my computer without having to code I use compass mongodb compass in order to um see what's inside of my database and to connect to your database mongodb is going to give you a little connection string which is like a private key that only you should know in order to um connect to database and perform operations like read or write the database that's when the notion of environment variables comes in so in your project there is something called of. loo which is like a secret file that you want to keep on your machine only I cannot show you mine at the moment uh but is basically where you want to store all your connection string API Keys Etc going back to the examples of chpt earlier um if you want to call the chpt API they will also give you an anop aai API key like a secret key in order to uh identify yourself and say like hey I am developer XYZ and I want to ask jgpt this question right now that we have a database moving on to authenticated users for that I use OJs this open source project here is very simple to get started um with just a few lines of code you can have a page like this one when you have a button for people to log in with Google login with email Etc uh they have core concept the provider is basically what uh type of services users will be able to use to log in so Google and magic links for instance adapters is where you're going to store the user data so when the user log in with Google for instance I want to save the user data in my database and OJs is going to do that automatically for me you also want to learn about cookies because those are like very important like you need cookies in order to authenticate users and then you will see it's pretty simple you want to sign in sign out users so there's like just two functions and then you will create private Pages private apis like content that is only available for people who are logged in to your app you might have to send emails there are two types of email there's the transactional emails and the marketing emails marketing emails are the ones who usually end in your folder transactional emails are are emails that we send as developer for people to sign in for instance you can send like a login to my app and there's a magic link and you would send that by email I use a resend for that they're really good because they also have marketing emails so if I if I want to follow up and you know uh send marketing emails like discounts I can use uh resent as well you will learn about MX record which are like a DNS record specifically for sending emails and um and of course you'll learn about sending magic links and now moving on to the next part charging money on the internet for for that you will need a payment provider uh there are two famous ones stripe and lemon squeezie and many others I use stripe personally uh if you're from India you won't be able to use stripe so you can use lemon squeezy uh they make everything a little simpler cuz they handle the vat for you I have been using stripe for a long long time and I basically open a new stripe account for any kind of business I launched on the internet depending on what type of payment you want to handle uh you will likely have to learn how to create a checkout session so that implies creating like a physical component a little H button like this one for people to click and it will uh open a payment page just like this one and the webbook stripe is going to send you a little notification to your API endpoint that says that hey this person with this email just made a payment this is where you would uh give the person access to your service and then very likely you will need a customer portal or customer billing whatever this is called uh this is the place where usually you can go uh here and click billing I can see what is my current plan what the credit card is used what is the invoice I'm using in stripe it's called portal it's very simple to set up they'll give you back a little URL like this one and you can give to your customers and they can handle everything here themselves right now you already have all the core concept of building a digital business uh one thing that is very important is about security to make sure that you don't leak your customer data that uh everything is safe etc for that you can use AI heavily inside of your codebase you normally have a chat with an AI and then you can ask lots of question do you think my app is safe you can start like large and refine until you uh cover every edge cases you really want to make sure that you ship an app where there is no security flows there are things that are important in terms of security it's to understand the notion of react server and client components it's safe to do things inside of react server components because they stay on the server it's not safe to do things like SEC things on the client components of course you want to use environment variables and store your API keys there to make sure that you don't push them accidentally on the internet uh you want to make sure that your API end points are safe and secure for instance that you verify that the person is authenticated in order to make the request that the person eventually has paid for a service in order to make the request Etc and then for more advanced concept where you uh your app is deployed on the internet you might have like people trying to scam you or something um you could use middlewares or firewalls in order to block access to your app to some countries some people Etc and uh finally you might want to learn some advanced concepts I don't really recommend learning anything unless you have like a strong use for it but those are some things that might be worth your time uh in nextjs learn how to use metadata in order to um eventually be index and rank on Google you can learn how to use tawin CSS Transitions and animations in order to make your app a little bit nicer to use the local storage in JavaScript is a really nice place to uh store some data where you don't need a database that is really up to you and up to your needs and we are now entering the most exciting part the 10x programmer using AI likely in your code editor you already have an AI that will help you write code explain Etc if you're using VSCO they have a free plan if you're using Cur like me I think it starts at $20 a month the llm is basically like the type of large language model you're using I'm using clo 3.7 sunet at the moment they just released it but to be honest it really doesn't matter as long as you don't do some like very Advanced programming uh it wouldn't make much difference and your AI will become your best buddy there are three core features the autocomplete one is more like a inline feature where you can select a line uh press command K and you can just you know rewrite a little something you have chat features that I use usually to ask the AI about how to organize my data about security Etc and a composer which can use an agent and can create files for you run script Etc you can become super super duper fast using AI you just have to use it right I'll link below to a video that I made about exactly how I use AI to code 10x faster there has never been a better time in history to learn how to code and build a side project for sure coding takes time but if you show up every single day for 30 minutes you won't believe where you are in just a few months from now future you is begging you to get started right now so close this video and go build something and just in case you want to dive a little deeper into this road map I made a longer three hours long video for free on YouTube where I walk you step by step through each of those steps until the next video I hope you keep shipping

TITLE: POV: you’re a millionaire developer automating 25 startups with AI
VIDEO ID: C2Bs_Zu103U
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2Bs_Zu103U
================================================================================

AI is getting so good it's scary I think I wrote less than 10% off the code it's time to go New Zealand wow has finally reached a th000 in monthly recording Revenue yes keep creating keep learning because the future is bright bringing the startup office around the world this is absolutely mindblowing meet Mark Lou a millionaire who owns exactly zero pairs of shoes and way more startups than you'd think is reasonable he sits here in this disgustingly beautiful Tropical Paradise to show you how to turn ideas into Brands strangers into clients and your boring job into a distant [Music] memory okay it's quite early in the morning and I just finished this course by Justin Welsh uh if you don't know him he's very very active on Twitter and Linkedin he has over a million followers on those platforms been inspired by the way he writes on Twitter to write my own tweets and around 2022 2023 after discovering his account and applying what he was doing my Twitter following started to uh grow much faster than it used to be and I got busy and distracted and it took me like more than a year to purchase this course the course is amazing it is exactly what you would expect from Justin Welsh it is perfect if you have any intention to um create anything on the internet and you need to share your thoughts with text the course I bought is called the content OS so it's going to teach you how to come up with a bunch of ideas and how to format those ideas into like a great packaging something that is pleasurable and easy to read and now my problem is that I have so many ideas that I'm going to dedicate an entire 30 minutes time slots per day to writing so check out Justin Welsh course it is really great I will add a link somewhere around this video uh this is not an affiliate program I just really loved the course and I really recommend you to have a look now it's time to write this is such a crazy story I have to show you this okay so this person back here was one of the first beta testers for the course code fast and I remember back then he was asking CHP to build components and trying to piece everything together usually when you do that it's pretty hard to actually build an entire software and I remember when we started uh the beta student part of code fast we went back to the very basic learning the fundamentals of the internet and then the basics like react Tailwind CSS Etc and at the same time back here had a full-time job so he was just studying part-time and he showed up every single day and sometimes it was really hard because learning to code is not the easiest thing to do in the world but he still showed up almost every single day and then somehow with the skills that he earned during the course he was able to build a project and softwares that gave him the opportunity to work for a company as a freelancer to make a project which he was paid $60,000 for that project I think this is a very beautiful lesson about not giving up once and also that sometimes you don't know what is going to happen but if you do something something unexpected positive can happen so just keep creating keep learning because the future is [Laughter] bright 4 minutes 4 minutes okay have your computer my clothes and of course bringing the startup office around the world we're getting a world world tour at the moment that sounds crazy but it is true we are living Bal and uh we're looking for a new home we're doing like house shopping so we're going to start with New Zealand and then we going to go to Japan Korea probably India then we're going to slowly go back to Europe and then hopefully we're going to end the year with Canada USA and South America we have no idea that there's no concrete plan yet we'll go where we treed best we're just going to be slow mads like finding places where you know it's chill we're going to stay a week two weeks sometimes even maybe a month or more if we like it it's time to to good New Zealand hello I'm if you're filming this can you please turn your camera off thank you the is turned off also be careful thank you byebye we made it we freaking made it yeah yeah we were live we finally made it here to Mona New Zealand after a 24 hours long trip we have one our plane that was cancelled so we were moved to the next one and then the plane to come here to the South New Zealand we thought we would almost die in the plane then we had the car rid and everything and anyway we ended up being in this place for 2 weeks so I just finished the morning workouts now it's breakfast time and after that I'm going to go for I don't know four 3 four hours of deep work and then with my wife we're going to visit a little bit what New Zealand is all about and this AI thing is absolutely crazy so I am making a little change log for data so I want to have a Le least of all the previous updates I've shipped somewhere ranked on Google for uh just for backlog maybe even for SE juice and for people who are using the app just to show that the app is being updated recently and consistently I literally ask my AI agents to do all the work for me I use the composer feature on cursor and then I use the mode right here agents and then I describe exactly what I want and then he end up making this change log right here where I have an entire p so it's available at/ Chang log then I have all the previous changes I've made on my app with a date title and a photo the photo is extracted from the video I make to present the new feature and so if I look at the mo the one I shipped in a couple days ago this is marked down so I don't even have to style I just write markdown stuff and then boom I have a a beautiful page I have the demo video right here I have a little promotion that I design also for um well the software itself and at the same time I am using this markdown template on the main main dashboard of data fast to show this little thing right here at the bottom a little uh widget popup that if people click it shows the exact same markdown I have in my change log the crazy part here is that I barely didn't even code this is what's driving me insane these days with AI since I have a code base and I already have some components I just say what I want and it's going to make a beautiful design based on my previous designs and I just write English this is just mad it's crazy I cannot help but think about what is going to be in the future what a developer can do with tools like AI that can code design maybe even do marketing at some points or at least come up with creative angles for marketing that makes the entire process of creating something on the Internet much simpler which is good and bad because at the same time there will be much more competitions I'm just an observer here and this is absolutely mind-blowing if you haven't tried try the cursor agent this is phenomenal after a long day of work there's nothing better than jumping into cold reader how was it it's freezing but it's still good are you going to try no welome to new look at this monkey one two three I was the back fet wow he a human monkey good yeah this is our dream house oh you're very so you're old so cute so so cute love those shitty belly dogs mhm almost each every time they they see you prepare by the way my okay I have a good news and a bad news the good news is that DFAS finally reached a th000 in monthly recurring Revenue yes so this is what the data fast dashboard looks like the revenue overall is up about 10 to 15% month of a month and in terms of monthly recurring Revenue it is now four digits it's growing steadily every month it's pretty slow but it's growing steadily there are now 100 active subscribers so people who have their credit cards and are paying every month to use the service thank you that means a lot at the moment there is about 133% turn rate which is not great but also not bad I think and now it's quite steady so I think the promise I make on The Lending page and what the product delivers is kind of aligned the bad news is that there is some sort of a time bomb in my app um if you can see this is my cluster right here where uh I store all the data the page views and the events Etc uh the dis is already at 150 gab which is uh significant not massive but significant and the thing is the build keeps going up and up and up and up and now it cost me around 60% of the revenue just for the database I will have to find a way to reduce this usage because I might be losing money if I keep having the same structure here I think this is some kind of Advent Mong to be um Tech thing here and I would love to have someone who is an expert eye on it so if that's the case uh there will be a link below this video if you can just apply and uh because I am too much of a developer in my head I collect feedback from my software using this little uh custom made tool where people can up vote and suggest features I added this little thing here to hopefully make the more engagement in the comments people can just uh add likes to replies and that would help me as a business owner know what they exactly want I also changed the algorithm so it gives more priority to post that were made recently with a votes that were made recently as well hopefully it creates some kind of like Dynamic feed of what people want at the moments so I can build the right feature for them it's chicken bro seriously it's chicken ah come here I me you don't pet the chicken I think this is the weakest cat I've ever seen he's like oh this skin is too chewy for me it's so fun okay literally there's no sign of boundaries here yeah the kitchen is there the bathroom is at the bottom of the corridor JavaScript I think I'm going to go for the yellow oh I'll go then what's your favorites this or making YouTube thumbnails this I don't like thinking I I just like doing AI is getting so good it's scary uh this is one of my website ship fast and I have this little uh widget here that is embedded this is not from ship fast it's coming from my web analytics software data fast where I created this entire new uh feature called widget using AI so basically anyone who tracks analytics with datafast will get access to a little uh piece of code that they can embed to any website and it will display like this little cards here that make some of their web analytics public they can uh customize some options like colors light or dark theme uh there are some options and it's crazy that I think I wrote less than 10% of the code I'm using again the cursor AI composer this AI thing is making me so productive as a developer and now I can spend more time on other side that are important like marketing for instance now we are early 2025 I am so curious to what is going to happen in just one year the first Meetup was a month ago 12,000 km away from here and now we're having a new Meetup in Wan New Zealand This truly is a worldwide community and also it's a very tiny town here compared to Paris and still there are eight people who registered and it's going to be one of the most beautiful scenery we've ever had I guess 5 minutes before the Meetup start it's so yeah it's hot this Brian Johnson goes behind the shadow to avoid the skin two minutes ago was trying to look for ice cream shop and now he's like oh no the Sun is going to destroy my screen I have to be careful ah so you changed the travel PL just to Mark drove 2 and 1 half hours from Mountain cook back here to meet you yes oh yeah oh yes you did and NBA in oh also you leave you settle down here now um not quite not quite it's I think it's the biggest ice cream I've ever had crazy freaking mess I really I've never seen this before ever okay it's uh 6 p.m. and this little person here made us do a hike one of the craziest hike you can do in onea it normally takes 6 hours it's 6:20 p.m. it's going to be dark in 3 hours and a half we're going to make 6 hour in 4 hours we're going to do the most insane thing ever yeah right go you're good and another one here we made it for 1 hour 40 minutes wow and we are completely did we we de I know was worth it it's so beautiful yes I can see why they having fun training feels like adenines and good stuff I learned something dur we were doing 16 kilm trkking like it's impossible to do it but we made it so I thought no matter hard work it looks like you just keep going like a focus on your one step two steps and then go straight to the top that's hardest way will definitely bring you the that is one you Robin care morning breakfast a few supplements and a morning tea and best of all a book oh talking of which I just finished this book by Kevin KY he's the author of wired one of the big Us magazine and he also wrote one of my top three favorite book ever called excellent advice of wisdom I wish I knew earlier and I was so interested about the author that I read this one it's about 12 forces like where the technology where new technology like AI Etc internet is going to go which direction is is going to go over the next 50 to 100 years it was written 10 years ago and it's crazy how fast things went and how right he was writing this book a lot of things that he mentioned uh is what's happening now with AI chpt Etc it's an excellent read it's super positive like it's just feel pleasurable and look forward to the future and most importantly it's answering one of the question I get asked most often which is about like all ideas are taken it's too late if you read the book you will realize that actually we are at the very beginning of something much bigger than us and it is the perfect time to start building any business like a tiny little thing on the internet because there are much more things to come in the future things are going to accelerate even faster read the book build something breakfast coding let's go out of mind you like a kiss and have a good time come here rock and roll everything he hey

TITLE: POV: your side project made $1M as a solo developer
VIDEO ID: -Jl9l3O9Hm8
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jl9l3O9Hm8
================================================================================

okay so this weekend project made a million dollar after 18 months just build whatever you have in mind we're going to leave Val and we're going to travel all over the world it's time to work boom a freaking million dollars get the weekend project this is a website build something build it fast code code code and then repeat over and over and over this is the freaking [Music] date meet Mark Lou a millionaire who owns exactly zero pairs of shoes and way more startups than you'd think is reasonable he sits here in this disgustingly beautiful Tropical Paradise to show you how to turn ideas into Brands strangers into clients and your boring job into a distant memory good morning good morning in doing the food we uh that would be a good thumbnail just came back to Bali full jet lag but it's time to work Houston we have a big problem Brian Johnson just released a new video about calculating your speed of Aging for free so the video looks looks like this and there are six markers that you can do at home for free like how many push-up reps can you do um and and some of many other stuff and of course that gives me tons of app ideas so what I did is I Clon my Bott plates and I ask my AI editor a cursor to build an entire app for me I didn't write a single line of code and this is what I came up with so that's uh this is this is pretty made with AI and those basically more like forms where you enter number push-ups one leg stand U and few of other metrics and then you can calculate your score and in the end it will give you a result on what's your biological age this is extremely lowlevel product for the moment I have tons of ideas like adding leaderboards uh making it verified with uh actually uploading photos connecting your Twitter Google accounts so it could be like a leaderboard with profile pictures for uh like real people I also bought a new domain name bio a.ge for Bio AG this this is a really early stage but there's something going on with health at the moment artificial intelligence is shaping the medical industry and if you are a maker it's a big wave to jump in because things are going to happen in many ways stepping into Healthcare right now is like stepping into that future world the next 10 years are going to be crazy with a mix of AI an AI tool they trained on medical data plus the health wave there tons of things to build and I really really really really recommend you to just jump in just build whatever you have in mind don't spend too much time on it just ship your idea out there I hope the app is ready when this video comes out if that's the case there will be a link in the description and my goal is to get Brian Johnson to see this app and retweet it let's go all right so something I I believe too is that if you want something to work out on the internet you get to put on the energy you have to leave through it in my case I'm really into mental health and physical health and I'm going to build tons of health related startups but at the same time I try to have a life that is perfectly healthy so that means better food better sleep more workouts that means I learn things that means I discover problems and that feeds my inspiration to build startups and because those startup ideas are based on real fact the life I live then I am almost guaranteed that at some point some of those startup will also appeal to some other people time for workout and if you don't know what is your thing then try new stuff travel abroad meet some new group of people like go to meetups where people have different skills than yours try something new get out of the comfort zone now time to C I just got this from Google it's a badge that says I got 10,000 visitors on one of my websites in the past 30 days this website actually was my first ever indie project and even though it's not sexy it's like a Bas simple movie recommendation app this project gave me this batch from Google but it also grew my follow on Twitter gave me tons of new startup ideas and it gave me the confidence I needed to get started so do more not sexy project any kind of project just shap something and maybe years down the road you'll get a website with 300 daily visitors and you can run ads and he could pay for your rent I'm reading the inevitable inevitable by Kevin KY the guy who created the magazine wired and also the author of a book one of my actually top three favorite books ever called excellent advice of wisdom I wish I knew earlier or something along those lines the book itself is is just a masterpiece it's a collection basically of like mini tweets that each of them is a life lesson and uh this one the inevitable is about predictions that he makes about where Tech and AI will drive the world like 12 prediction on how the world is going to change I'm 36% completed with this book and I already love it full rainy season in b meanwhile delicious meal prepar by it's 7:30 a.m. and I just bought another domain two days two domain names now that I am back in my office in Bali I'm super super happy to add this into my room office whatever this is because it's here in this room that this was made possible and actually same as this little thing here is because at some point I decided to sit in this room and just spend most of my time building stuff that those two things happen so keep shipping I just set up these recovery emails so this is being sent to people who actually uh complete a part of the checkout they leave their email address but they don't complete the payment could be because the credit card failed it could be because they changed their mind at the last minute so what I'm doing here in the stripe webbook event called checkout. session. expired I'm checking if the person left an email otherwise I can't email them and if the person is not already a customer of mine and if that's the case then I send them a very simple email that says hey I noticed you were checking out cut fast yesterday anything I can help you with and then a link to get back to my landing page just in case they forgot or in case something go wrong here what I'm doing with this is I'm opening the discussion so I'm trying to understand why they didn't purchase even though they click the button and left their emails and I just hope this will give me some uh better uh feedback so I know maybe how to tweak the landing page to convert more visitors and if you want the code there is a link to one of my tweets below this video where you can just copy past the code and use it in your own project okay so I just set up YouTube ads for my course code fast I am very bad at ads really really bad but I want to give it a try because we never know uh sometimes you try stuff and it works and sometimes it doesn't but uh just curious about this one still waiting for Google to approve the ad and um let's see how it goes okay so quick update on Coach fast the course I launched about a month and a half ago uh you can see the revenue uh of course at the launch was going up like crazy and then now it's slowing down and what I'm trying to do uh for this first quarter of the year is to try to find a recurring marketing channel and since it's a course is pretty large I'm targeting like a very wide audience so I'm trying to run ads to this website so I created this sort of uh as here so you want to learn a code to build your own online business go to cast.now enroll for the course learn the basics and everything you need to build an online business ready to get customers so my video editor pH a model in Bell to help me read the script and since I absolutely suck at making a marketing scripts I asked my friend Nico who is really good at marketing to help me with that and then for the format I got inspired by clo which is a very famous software engineer on you YouTube I remember 3 four years ago I was watching a bunch of his videos then I saw a masterpiece of an ad and I use his format to make my own ad and I just started running this uh YouTube video on Google ads so it's only showing on YouTube at the moment I just started spending money so I have two campaigns one uh that is a wide campaign so it targets people who are somehow in the software engineer coding industry so people who visit websites like code academy or who watch a YouTube like a programming YouTube YouTu channels it looks like it's getting a bunch of clicks for the amount spent about $30 per day uh but so far no conversion so I don't know if I'm doing something wrong with my code or if it's just not converging at the moment and I set up another campaign where it's more like retargeting people who visited the websites uh usually this is what marketer calls that like a warm audience so people who are more likely to buy your product because they already know what you have to sell and uh Google is going to show this ad to those people where it gets way less click but somehow it converted already uh I think there was one purchase which makes the campaign profitable making ads is really not my uh cup of tea but I feel like if I manage to make it click it could be one way to make sure that the business somehow is steady and then I can focus on for instance um making more lessons adding more things for students so my time and mind doesn't have to be on the marketing side of things and of course if I get good results I'll report that in those videos I can't not put this on the record this should be remembered 15 ingredients vegetables and love that's the recipe important is there wave sir yeah tomorrow is going to be firing W hello little babies hello hello this is uh the place here where we came with tons of ideas for the Vlogs tons of startup ideas walking man it's a such a creativity hack that's true okay so we are deciding where we go this year because we're going to leave Bal and we're going to travel all over the world to meet you we're going to host a Meetup we're going to host Meetup countri first is New Zealand then we're going to go to Japan Japan oh we're going to do a meet up in B first then the plan is right now we go India first then we go back to Europe we were thinking of doing like Norway Finland Sweden North countries just for the peacefulness and quietness and then maybe the US go we know that there are many people living in the North America like Canada us so we're excited to meet you there as well that's very true and if you can maybe St or Central America because it has been my you know dream to go back there and we go back to France for next Christmas the issue here is trying to stay productive while traveling so I still make apps we still make those Vlogs we still make more videos on YouTube right for the news later make some tweets while trying to enjoy traveling this is the really hard part but uh yeah let's see it now it's put on the camera we'll see how that year goes it's so empty there is no one here except this person good wave tomorrow yeah this is where I'm surfing yeah I'm excited I cannot wait for tomorrow wow look at this man such a de Focus mode we're working on I I am designing this was one of the most requested feature so now you can watch your website analytics for specific like a custom date range so you have this option where you can choose to watch for custom and then you have this date biger yeah that's pretty much it so I'm pushing this today I guess I spend too much time on this but I freaking love it I like all the little animations where the mouse cursor moves and even this you know like this little transition when you move the cursor and then it's just super exciting actually to make this kind of stuff I didn't really like at the beginning then you realize design is absolutely not about creativity but more like principles it's a mix of rules and coping what's working adding your own signature on top of it and then a little bit of obsession no coffee and straight wake up code code code ah quick update on my web analytics software data fast so let's look first at the revenue on stripe now I start to see daily payments which make me super happy like little uh sales notifications uh here we're looking at the last what 3 weeks or so of data uh so we can see the monthly recuring revenue is at 925 which is getting close to $11,000 per month that makes me super happy it's overall going up constantly and the number of active subscribers as well and the subscriber turn rate is now around 14% I guess which is uh I I think I can leave up with it I added new feature this uh option here will let users choose uh when they want to query their data and I also spend a little too much time designing this uh loading screen where uh when people change the type of Journey they want to see they want to know what their customers are doing on their sites they're going to see like a little spinner like a loading screen here so they have something to look at and they know it's loading this is not necessarily useful but this just made me so happy I also created a documentation for data fast to help people set up their accounts so this is kind of like a Blog SL documentation this is using a mark down down template right here where I just have to write English and a couple of markdowns and it outputs a nice looking documentation and of course I had to design every little uh things from scratch but now that it's designed I don't do anything I just make beautiful articles uh very simply oh and one last thing I am not sure I mentioned this in the this YouTube video I set up server side tracking which means that now people using data fast and tracking payments with it can link visitors and customers data with almost 100% accuracy so that they know exactly where the money is coming from the goal with this software is to grade to a million dollar in valuation so that's about 20 to $225,000 in monthly recuring Revenue we're far from there and there are still a lot of things to build but uh it's going up so this is a positive thing are you ready for the cold PL no more Russian what is this head actually I really don't know I hope our Russian friends can tell us what is this okay please leave in the comment what is this for yes look at this wow with all this view very good yeah so let's take some SAA and think about our life Wow super hot man so H the the iPhone will die the warmest sa I've ever is it cool so I think you can stay unlimited here until we I need a massive [Applause] coconut I found a flower W influencers daily reminder for happiness it's time to work what is it what do you see um 800k we have cross $1 million with ship Fest already wow how many months 18 18 months this this is the freaking date we made it what's very crazy to me is we were sitting in the exact place 18 months ago we made almost 0 back then yeah and I remember I had this little weekend project that I created for myself and I was like ah I'm going to try to launch it and right here it was 5:00 p.m. I was about to go skate before it's dark and I put the computer and I told you I launched something on product hunt I'll be back in 2 hours we're lucky if we make $300 I had no idea any of this would happen oh yeah cuz back then we didn't have any result so if you can have like one or three sale it was still success you know and then one year and a half later boom a freaking million dollar with a weekend project this is a website the launch day was crazy CU we earn like $4,000 a day yeah about three 3.5 but still like for us like $1,000 was a monthly salary and then yeah we kept having notification and we were in Hong Kong we kept up what is happening is it real like yeah it's was like did you make money we refresh like wow we just drank coffee more Starbucks Cooke wow we made more money in 24 hours than we would in 6 month crazy okay so this weekend project made a million dollar after 18 months and 85% of that is pure profit these are the stripe dashboard so that's the first one back in 2023 and I then I opened a new business and this is the new one so I wanted to tell you a little story about finding million-dollar startup ideas I started the entrepreneurship in 20 2016 back then I had a Grand Vision like a big dream I was working 12 hours a day and I believe that IDs were Priceless and 4 years later I made around $70,000 with one of my set which let me pay the bills which is technically not bad I was able to leave anywhere with a computer but with all the sacrifices I made it was clearly not worth it and that's why I had a burnout in 2020 and this is the actual SAS I created I was working with physical businesses Escape rooms and in then in 2020 Co killed my set it went literally from about $4,000 in monthly recurring Revenue to zero in a single month and after that I had almost no savings no ideas to start next and not even motivation to start again so I started to look for a job and I work as a software engineer for someone that you might know tylerz and they offered me a salary that was way beyond what I ever thought I would earn so obviously I accepted and I worked for them for 9 months but of course there was this it ins inside of me this Freedom itch that keeps scratching back and called me back and so in November 2021 I started entrepreneurship again and this time I had a different set of rules I dit all the ambitious and the Big Dreams that I had before and instead I would work on tiny little project that I could launch on a weekend I would share everything publicly on Twitter and then I would just launch move build while making sleep my number one priority and back then my goal was to create something that I can control and the goal was to create a massive portfolio of websites sometimes those websites are not even monetized like this one here where you can vote for your favorite quote from Naval ravikant about this websit where you can like visualize how much you can achieve in one year with tiny habits I build this directory of gamification apps there was no goal really it was just purely I want to build this portfolio of websites and 12 months later I had made around $10,000 and grow a little audience of 5,000 people on Twitter which is definitely good but clearly knowing that I was working all day and then I was already in the game for 5 years this is also not crazy but it doesn't matter because I was actually having tons of fun and since my obsession was to build a portfolio massive portfolio a website I wanted to create a little tool for myself so that I can make those websites faster so I created this tool called ship fast and launched it on the last day of August 2023 2 days later it made $6,000 what I would typically earn in 6 months and now day 18 months later it made a million dollar this is just absolutely crazy because in my journey it was just yet another website with uh no marketing strategies no big plans nothing just a little tool I need for myself but this experience took me one thing that is crucial startup ideas are not found they are crafted from your own experience so instead of waiting for uh something a good idea to come and strike you instead here is what you can do [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] around and find out build something build it fast share it to the world whether it's on Twitter Youtube or Instagram repeat the same process but this time build something different or share it in a different way and then repeat over and over and over and then in all the noise you create when it's time some luck something some signal will find you so if you're a developer like me who loves to create stuff this is your advantage ship stuff no matter the outcome no matter if you get lots of users no matter if it makes some money just ship it for the sake of it ship it to create the noise so that luck can find you later keep shipping I want to confess something I bought a new domain name damn it

TITLE: I got KICKED OUT for hosting an ILLEGAL meetup with 100 developers!
VIDEO ID: QLE5SGu0ID4
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLE5SGu0ID4
================================================================================

in my case the key for this was to try to live an unusual life Wow 2024 everything compounded this is so crazy I'm I'm extremely nervous [Music] mental and don't forget to put this freaking pay and I hope you had a good time Mark time to open the YouTube Silver we've been waiting for so long open it okay okay this so beautiful it's weird to receive package from YouTube we started YouTube like January this year than all right oh wow YouTube made a welcome letter what do it say do you remember your first subscriber your 100th or your thousands keep creating keep building oh wow they it feels like the YouTube see sent me a liter so keep creating keep building we can't wait to see what you'll do next and we're here to support you along the way and who knows when you reach your millionth subscriber you may just write to you and ask do you remember your 100,000 subscriber wow that is it the silver it's super legit wait that's beautiful presented to Maru for passing 100,000 subscribers yeah so how how do you feel I grew up with YouTube like my University my teacher everything is YouTube from copyrighting marketing just even coding like most of my coding skills come from YouTube like this has been a long for a while like I would watch Youtubers with this stuff in the background and you know you kind of Imagine like wow that must be such a cool life to have this in your background this guy must be crushing it and just seeing it in real like it's I'm one of them now that's is so crazy I'm just I don't know I'm also okay it's time bragging time but I'm also very proud of me of course you've been showing up every day i' been making a YouTube video once a week even though you work full time on your app yeah this man Honestly YouTube is one of the least unexpected events that happened this year because the entire Journey started from like close to zero followers in January and pass 100K 2 months ago or something less than 10 months from Z to 100K and knowing that this is not my full-time job like this is a habit every Saturday I would make a video and only on Saturday I would wake up in the morning I have to find an idea an interesting angle a thumbnail an intro and shoot the entire video and be done by the end of the day and I stick to that habit since January this year and this happened I didn't quit I didn't quit at the beginning nothing was happening to month month was nothing like I made 10 videos it was nothing any tips to make a video like that you like to make but also people like to watch that's an interesting one I think the I think I'm um I'm not the typical YouTuber because I'm not a content creator I I just try to leave A Life That's unusual and make content out of it so my life is the story I don't create a story my life is the story and we tried to package it in a YouTube videos that hopefully feels like a better story but the key I think the key for this in my case the key for this was to try to live an unusual life and for that that means building stuff that people normally don't build um I don't know like doing Health routine that people normally don't follow this is what is behind this YouTube button yeah try to leave something that fills you and that not everybody is living try to make something different and try to stick to it long enough so that becomes your identity and people will identify you as the guy who does this can you show me one more time squ then press if I drop him we get Legacy earlier foreign speee spee I'm on the train to go to the south of friends from Paris to visit some relatives so I'm taking some time to break down things that happened recently so okay first for the launch of data fast it's been now 30 days exactly and it made 300,000 in Revenue which is absolutely mind- glowing it's by far the best product I've ever built and now that some students start to finish the course they start to get results and build their own websites and some even get users and customers that really makes me so happy I am also breaking down everything I achieved in 2024 and as a comparison this is my salary since I got fired from my software engineer job so literally nothing happened for the first 2 years I was just barely surviving then something took off in 2023 and in 2024 everything compounded I had no idea I would create a baller plate I had no idea I would make a course I actually had no idea what would happen I just knew that if I stick to something maybe eventually something will happen and let me um um be financially independent so I've just planted a bunch of seed like from the moment I got fired I I I made all those like 25 plus websites and then eventually at some point some of those website took off and created a little story and compound it if we take a software like Indie page for instance which is a little Link in BIO tool um it started earlier back in 2022 he was he was making roughly like couple hundred a month and just because I posted on the internet people gave me feedback they wanted to see some features and I just listened to my users and I started to implement those features one of them they wanted to see is an SEO backlink and the revenue kept growing because of that feature it's a matter of consistency showing up it's a matter of not giving up and listening to users and staying in the game long enough until it happens to you there's a quote that says we overestimate what we can achieve in one day but we underestimate what we can achieve in one year and this could summarize exactly my journey I never believe I would be able to build so many startups but I've have been showing up every single day and eventually something happened if you believe in yourself and show up consistently this can be your journey too you can do it V I recently was asked which feature should I prioritize for my software and usually I put them into two buckets the product features and the growth features and I split my time 50% for each bucket for instance for this little uh piece of software that I built and for all of the product features I have one goal in mind is to reduce the churn I just go to my stripe dashboard and I look at the subscriber turn rate and my goal is to make it go as low as possible and when you mix reducing turn and building features you end up building features your users want and for that I have built in my software again a little um feedback board page where my users can submit whatever they want to see in the product they can also up vote what other people post and so as a business owner I know exactly what my users want then I just list all of them by priority and I build them into the product for instance the one I working on right now is to let people search their uh analytics for a custom date wrench the goal with the product features bucket is to make people love the product so much that they don't want to churn and then there's is the other bucket which I call the growth features bucket it's features that users normally don't request it's more like my creative brain wants to add something uh because I think it might be valuable for my users one of them for instance which I shipped recently is uh in the email report use my users get from data fast at the bottom there is a growth Insight which is like an AI that is trained on the data from my customers to help them understand some patterns and how to make more money from some specific marketing channels this is not something I can ask my users because this is something I can only guess from my mind and the goal with this kind of bucket is to try a new vertical for my product to try to um find something that makes the product so good because it has this specific feature that my users will want to spread the word about it that I can update the lending page copy and say that this product can also do that which is amazing um it has some sort of like a grow business growth or virality embedded into it and I just split my time 50% improving the actual product and 50% adding new features and this is how somehow on data fast I'm able to increase the number of active subscribers without losing much of them and I'm not 100% sure where this is going to go but that's the blueprint I trust to grow this software to a million doll in valuation finally this Sunday we're going to have some first meet up in Paris oh yes no this is this is two days right yes this is totally mad look 500 likes okay BR this is so crazy we just thought it would be nice to meet people behind the camera who are into like making apps and building little startups on the internet and I make a random tweet with a form for to submit just you know if you want to meet us like we open meet up actually I feel it's a very unplanned un nothing we don't have a script we don't have a place it's like open Meetup in the middle of Paris and I just posted that the Tweet got 500 likes which is a lot and then the four 130 people wow 13 people coming in the Jan l yeah we thought like just 10 to 20 people sign up then it would be amazing because we posted very in the last minute and it's out it's like 3° outside it might be raining it's outdoor there's no splend or whatever 130 people actually we we might do it again in Bali and New Zealand very soon and I think if we both like it we can create like a even schedule of places where you're going to go even we're going to organize and I still don't know exactly how to structure the event but at least we can you know organize them in advance people can register and eventually we get to meet someone across the world yeah why you're concerning no serly this is going to be a mess we are 200 participants for the Meetup are going to manage everyone I I rely on you you're the one me yes I am I'm developer you know like uh you know I you the social person here how can I speak to 200 people in open space I think we we really I think we clearly underestimate how big 200 people is and let's say only 50% of them come that's 100 people and Mark is super nervous it's his first time like a speaking from dness I'm I'm extremely nervous I'm extremely nervous well you got this it's going to be fine people love you and people all want hear the story I hope it's valuable for people who are coming I really hope so y see you there we can I think we will make like two to three minutesand I'm not radio programmer I have take the Cod fast course of Mark maybe one month ago this is why I was really jealous of you guys because uh you can just take your ideas and bringing to life computers and I cannot so that's why I take the course of Mark it was really help so maybe some testimonials life testimonials so because uh programming it's uh really complicated for people who don't have the code uh it's a really hard to understand the the full picture and the course really help me because uh it takes everything maybe on the surface and uh and help me have the big picture understand what is really uh building a product8 years8 years oh okay 8 years have problem uh the lesson is even if the app is a very very simple app you don't know what user is actually going to Value so just ship it sh uh it was inspired a lot by this community so thanks everybody who is doing this crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh it's um yeah it's a huge motivation thank you everything and don't forget to put this freaking payable I'm poine and I started to create SAS I think three years ago uh with many failures I created websites Etc but uh each time I started a project I just abandoned just start if you have an 0 so and uh by the way it's to uh stick with it uh share your journey because when you are sharing people are here to help you to give you advice if you do everything in the shadow nobody will know and of course you're ID will remain secret but uh if you don't want your ID to be secret if you want to earn money with it so just uh ship it don't overthink and uh talk a lot about your project because everybody can help how do you find a good idea okay so I think yes I tried many different topics like I tried to create a fun Instagram account I tried crypto I tried b2c and I think product that was failure wasn't a failure at the end because it teached me a lot when you think your idea is good when you have idea how to Market it try to do things but if it doesn't bring any traction just for at a certain moment just drops the idea I think we just had a meet up I just talked to Fabian and Carlos and they all say I mean not all but some people say they came they took a flight to come to this meet up that's crazy yeah it was it was just a tweet in my head it was just a tweet and people really loved it it's like everybody thanks for thank you so much for coming it was absolutely amazing and we got this gift one gift is actually one I think it's a book one is actually for you oh really yeah oh so kind oh what book is it it's ads from like a old collection of ads oh that's love Yeah Bo love your creativity this is such a nice gift oh Mar want to say oh I think this one maybe oh it's in French what Walt oh Walt Disney autobiography I think no I think he sketches and maybe the his story maybe well everybody we met today all had the desire to build their own abs and you know have this entrepreneurship freedom and I think about half of them is making money on the internet already already wow that was really impressive how many people came today I think we were we were 100 we have yeah we have to show like right now boom footage of the group photo yeah mental so how did you feel meeting all those people you know real life we'll do it again we'll do you again yeah yeah I'll be more prepared I guess it feels good I think it feels good for everyone most of most of people the thing the number one thing they mentioned is please create a group and do it again m M I think I think there is there's something I think there's you know this it's you you feel lonely somehow in the journey I do feel lonely in and I think people were happy to connect with others mhm so yeah we we'll do it again yeah look at where we're going to the mission Star restaurant in Paris I'm really happy we can give the nice lunch experience to our family as Christmas gift go back to Bali it's time to Surf oh okay we are in Paris airport we are going back to Bali we're late uh this is one day after the event it was crazy over 100 people of you came and it was just insane I got to meet some of you um I got to meet this crazy guy you must want to check the story in the description I made a tweet about him he made over 3 million in 2024 and he did zero marketing this is pure inspiration and since you guys love the Meetup so much we are going to do it again the next one will be in Bell then New Zealand then likely Japan and I will keep you posted on when those Meetup happens using Discord so there is a link below this video where you can join a public Discord where you and other people who are into entrepreneurship can just come and join you can hang out with people who've been to previous meetups you can organize your own meetups and this is where I'm going to keep you posted about the location and the in the date of the upcoming meetups I hope to there I would like you to take your own desires right now and act on it as soon as you go home build that app

================================================================================

[Music] oh man workout always feel like a burden before I start but it feels so good when I'm done okay so some people asked how do I get feet but the truth is I am lazy I've never been to a gym and I don't have time I have nine tiny businesses to run and so I build a little system for myself that requires the minimum input for the maximum output so here are the eight Fitness rules that transfer my body and uh my workout routine is at the end so rule number one I always g a really good night of sleep there is a part of the brain that is responsible for uh self discipline and decision making and that part regenerate during the night I think it's called the preal cortex like some Andrew ubberman thing but I can tell that if I have 6 hours of sleep I'm going to wake up and everything will feel hard I know I have to work out but I'll struggle to find the motivation and it's going to be so easy for me to just ditch that workout session but on the other side if I sleep 8 hours my motivation my self- will power is much stronger and then I never dit the workout and of course there is this like deep sleep thing where you have all the muscle recovering happening during the night so always try to get 8 hours of sleep this is super important a good place to get started is to always go to bed at the same time my bedtime is 9:00 p.m. and I never uh change that try to sleep in a room that is a little bit cold have a little wind down routine where you don't look at your phone or you don't think about work before going to bed and avoid having heavy meals before going to bed now the rule number two is to always work out in the morning the reason is because there is like the dopamine system that makes us do things in order to get the reward but now with like social media and and uh sugary food and stuff like that we can easily get dopamine for like the really minimal amount of effort and so that workout feels like it's really hard it's a really hard thing to do but the good thing is that when you work out in the morning your brain is like pure because during the night the the brain restores the dopamine level to like a Bas line it's much easier to find motivation early in the morning and whenever I tell myself I'm going to work out someone in the evening because I don't have time right now I always end up not doing it rule number three is to work out every single day I know it seems hard but the truth is you don't need to go to the gym and spend 2 hours what you want to do is you want to start extremely small you can start with 10 push-ups per day you want to do it every single day early in the morning until you start building an identity of a person who works out every single day there's a really good book about that which is atomic habits and this is how you forge a new personality and now because I build this like habit of working out every day it is impossible for me to not work out I wouldn't say I like workout but I am addicted like this is my new personality and if I don't work out I feel bad which then pushes me to do the workout no matter what and so what I started doing is at first I made the workout very small like super tiny so I couldn't say no because it was like 10 minutes and then I started to add a little bit more workout every day when it became too easy more push-up more chin up more ABS Etc rule number four is to know exactly what you want to get I don't care having a bulky physic I don't care having massive biceps I'm not Alex hormozi this is something I do not care about I know exactly what I want I want to be lean I want to be fit I want to be able to jump I want to be super flexible stretchy this is exactly what I want and that is much easier than having a massive body with massive muscles I have picked a goal that I can achieve relatively easily so that I so that I am always satisfied now the mistake number five is that to push extra hard and I see lots of people making that mistake for me I work out a very minimal amount of time 30 to 40 minutes per day but when I am in these workouts I become a beast like there's nothing else that matters outside there's no f there is no distraction I am 100% into the workout and what I try to do is I always try to have an extra rep I try to beat the teacher that's my new game I try to go faster than them like I am 100% committed into the workout so that in the minimum amount of time I invest for that workout I'll get the maximum output rule number six is to find a workout that feels like a play to you I have been struggling with motivation my whole life it started with school because my teachers were boring then I struggled to find pleasure in the in the workouts still but the cure to that is to play and workout is not my playground surfing is so whenever I can I live in Bal I will go for a surf session and dit the workouts because I do something that I like it is so easy to find the motivation to get started it is so easy to push that extra rep because it feels like a play try to find something you like that could be running that could be climbing there many other activities that you can do rather than just doing workout at home rule number seven is to move more of I used to think that um walking and things like low intensity workouts that doesn't make me sweat are useless I studed to understand kind of understand how the body works like how the food is processed and how it's used to consume energy and just simply walking consumes lot of energy it will basically drain the glucose out of the blood use it as energy and then it will consume the fat in order to find more energy and so just walking will make you leaner they say that everywhere that 10,000 step per day is making you healthy I refuse to believe it for so long and now I Chang my mind so every time after a meal I'll will go on the trend meal at home and I would spend 10 to 15 minutes walking fast making at least 1 kilometer so that I Cross My 10K steps because the problem with my work is that I am working on my computer most of the day and uh actually maybe I should make more YouTube videos because at least I get to stand a little bit rule number eight and the final one is eating the right food it's crazy how much it impacts the body shape the first one the most obvious one is that when you eat protein you grow muscles so for that I eat P protein uh in addition to what I eat on a daily basis to make sure I have enough protein and I try to eat at least 1.5 time my weight in protein so I have around 120 gam of protein per day and the second most important effect on the body is that it burns fat uh I'm not a scientist or a doctor uh but roughly what I understand is that first the body when it needs energy it will use the glucose and then it will burn the fat out of the body so technically if you don't overeat you should lower your body fat what I eat on a daily basis could be an entire video but it's roughly this I eat mostly vegetables like I eat tons of vegetables recently I tried an experiment where I cut down completely carbage Foods so bread pizza pasta grains and stuff like that and that had a dramatic impact on my Cravings I used to be hungry all the time across the day and since I remove that and now I eat really really low carbs I don't have cravings anymore I'm not even hungry I eat two meals per day and I just feel lighter not wanting to eat and of course that impacts my body and I'm lovering my body fat and on top of that I don't eat any sugar whatsoever and I don't drink alcohol I eat a few supplements so I have this like collagen peptide this is not a sponsored video by the way this is just literally my collagen peptide I I eat around 10 gr per day I think I feel like it feels good for the ligaments I have way less pain than I used to I actually I don't have any pain anymore um this really changed my life the supplements from Brian Johnson the blueprint stack as I said I also eat a little extra protein from like protein PE protein powder and creatine around five four to five gr per day which same could be an entire video by itself uh also change my life make my brain feel like better sharper and feels like the Muscle Recovery is way faster okay now this is my workout routine I have a base that is around 10 minutes that I do every single day no matter what that includes 20 uh pullup and chinups each 28 80 push-ups I do 40 push-up in a weird position and 40 push-ups in another weird position I always try to rotate what kind of uh push-ups I do I do 125 Russian situps and if possible I will use a dumbbell like a 10 kilo dumbbell on top of that and I finish with a 5 minute plank I put on a music that is around 5 minutes and I try to hold as much as I can the numbers are weird like 20 25 85 whatever is because as I said before I am building tiny habits and whenever I reach level where I'm comfortable I try to add an extra rep an extra rep an extra rep until I get comfortable and of course when I started it was much lower than that I couldn't even do five pull-up chin-up and on top of that I have two Alternatives if the waves are good in B I'll will go surf right away but if the waves are crap like they are at the moment and for the past two weeks I would just do a workout at home there are two types of workout I do mostly it's either calisthenic 30 to 40 minutes of like pure body weight slow movements uh very hard on the muscle but slow movements or I'm going to do interval high-intensity interval training for like 30 minutes while push the cardio to the next level and I tried to rotate a calisthenic a hit a calisthenic and a hit and just recently my wife bought some dumbbells and I started like dumbbell workouts like 10 kgam workout I found all my routines on YouTube I watch Caroline g a famous YouTuber's videos and I just follow along and I try to beat her and final part I don't think this one really impact my body shape but it makes me feel good uh I do 15 minutes of stretching for going to bed there is a huge part on Fitness which is about genetics we all have different metabolisms um so those are my results but my wife started to follow the same routine actually I followed my wife routine more than that she's Asian and she's a female so completely different genetics and the results she's had are crazy I'm super proud of her when we met 7 years ago we both had neglected Fitness for a little while and in the past year or so we've taken Health to the next level and the results she's had are absolutely crazy when I look at her back she look like she has like those almost you could climb on top of it um all because we are following these like rules that uh I just mentioned in the video and then I think I made this entire video in one shot right after workout I didn't eat any single food this morning and it's almost 11:00 a.m. so now it's time for the breakfast and the protein shake do that workout today

TITLE: I MADE $100,000 IN 2 DAYS 🤯🤯🤯
VIDEO ID: TXla9Zq3Iqc
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXla9Zq3Iqc
================================================================================

we launched 36 hours ago $68,000 relx what took you so long just sh a new feature should I [Music] click blue pill or the red pill I just shipped a new feature on ship fast it's called Perks it's basically a list of discounts for popular products I'm so happy cuz I was able to work with versal which is one of the most common hosting platform out there as well as some really cool other products I'm about to add another one called recent to send emails and the entire bundle is worth over $1,000 in discount I'm carefully handpicking product that either help people save money or make more money cuz my goal is to help a th000 makers make $1,000 online and also now at the same time on my landing page I can say things like this where I can show how much worth of discounts people can expect to get and that makes the price of the ball plates looks cheap compared to that so I hope that will improve a little bit the conversion rate okay so we are two days before black Friday everything was planned and scheduled and I do the last checkup with my friends I always do that whenever I launch a new startups I always send it to a couple of my friends ask what they think about it because when I build a learning page I'm always in my head and sometimes I don't see things and it would be a terrible mistake if I just ship the startups as it is so I ask a few people around me what they think about it and this is not good ah I was really convinced that the landing page was great like good enough to launch and all my friends from different background told me it is not good at all like really I got really poor feedback uh the problem is I have 2 days left I I just don't I I I don't even know what I will have time to do build it launch it wow you're man my heart just m be like crazy all right I want to see where surf brings the cardio level I don't think I get this exhausted when I surf what's the next so we made the cardio heat goes up next is a little bit of muscle strengths I do planks then I usually do at pull-ups push-ups push-ups and 40 pull-up chein up for 20 pull-up 20 whatever and uh that's it it's either cardio at home or surf which also does the cardio and build muscles but then I don't really leave we apart really sometimes so I try to have always like those CH up P up push-up Etc so I do a little bit of strength as well not just cardio since I didn't do any ABS I'm going to do a little bit this it's I'm going to say something very controversial but I think my strength is my laziness because I know I would never be able to go to the gym I know I would never have the courage to go to the gym and do the communting and spending two hours and thinking about the gym because I'm lazy and I don't want to do that I try to find my own constraints and rules in my laziness bubble interesting because people need to investment to feel more motivated they need that membership to show up if is a home they be EAS it to compromising it's a really good point it's a really good I think it come it boils down to how you are like what how what's your way of doing things the book Atomic habits James Clear mhm one of the first book I read after after I didn't read any books because High School make me hate reading it's prob the first book I read and it says they make it so easy you can't say no and that's that's very true like start with 10 push-ups per day beginning new what took you so long I guess your 9 to5 became a 9 to9 this is where people realize I am 12 years old this is my favorite part of launching startups is you know I haven't done any of those videos this year the last one it was with mat Maki no go everywhere Dad they are my friends I talk to them oh for logo Fest which was December last year logo Fest the fre you made 5,000 in 3 days yes that's it one why do you make the video before lunch because the internet is crowded and at some points if you want to get your message across the room you have to find something that feels like you mhm that people will give their time to watch what you have to offer and because of that they'll give me like a minute of their time to look at what I have to offer and it happens that eventually if they're learning if they're trying to learn how to code they might watch like they might visit the site and might even purchase and I think the the purpose of this video is eventually to get attention in a way that feels genuine that feels like my way of getting attention basically CH P found the right movie for me I know what I'm going to sell I know roughly you know the angle the angle is very important once we talk again is I'm not making just another course and you're making the course to learn to code for entrepreneurs not employees entrepreneurs this is very important because then you can dit 90% of all the stuff you have to learn when you're a software engineer or an employee so it's a minimal course that teach you everything you need to know to go from zero to a software I think when you I mean like most people I guess you eat around 2 hours before bed M you eat that 700 and you go to bed at 9:00 or you eat at 8:00 you go to bed at at 10:00 we used to do that and then we started to do 6: and 5: p.m. 3 4 5 hours before bed and we realize that when we go back to the original 2 hours before bed the heartbeat is actually racing M and when you do four five hours before it's like you're much more relaxed data says we have better deep sleep and I feel much better as well MH you do feel any difference after I don't see much difference between five and 7 hours like we do now yeah for us I think the big shift is at least 4 hours before bed you're done 4 hours before bed you don't touch any food even not water so you don't go to toilet when you wake up now it's 8:00 p.m. still rolling man we never working that late yeah we normally finish work at least at 6 and wow a long day I think it's honestly one of the stress most stressful lunch I've ever done yeah yeah I'm launching late because of Black Friday like I have a deadline and so I have to check every little thing like there's so many things like from check out to customer dashboard that there's no you know like everything is responsive it's like works on mobile like crazy just crazy do you think you will ever make it today Black Friday I I there's no way I don't make it yesterday I was actually yesterday was a big failure who were supposed to launch yesterday I I realized I don't know anything like I thought it would take me one day to make the video and it took me 2 days and now I'm like super late still the countdown 4 hours I'm going to release okay so now right now I'm literally this is the Tweet I'm about to click publish it goes live Twitter thread LinkedIn whatever and then I'm going to use cod fast uh data fast to monitor the traffic on COD fast how many month of work this is 9 month of work in the making one click for 9 month should I click oh what I clicked I clicked it's publishing wa the first sale alert oh man that makes you so happy it is not a z product so it's time to check the revenue Bo it's it's not even 24 hour yet 23k 17 hour 23k I've never seen I mean holy this is D first dashboard $1,000 in the last 24 hours she first doing great and this is absolute Madness oh my God my man I mean look at that it's spread across the world French people what's happening look at that we launched 36 hours ago one day and a half ago 68,000 honestly I don't know if it's real no way what the hell man there's no way there's no way honestly I'm happy you're recording this because this is this will never happen again this is just insane wait me we sent 11,000 visitors on Coast 11,000 visitors and it makes 50k it's like a 4 $4 per visitors if you're more than $1 that's amazing and $4 is a god level 2% conversion rate on a product that cost at minimum 150 bucks all mostly Twitter mostly Twitter yeah wow 7,000 from Twitter wow that's a lot oh so 7,000 visitors yeah that's that's quite a lot yeah wow there's so many people who didn't know how to code following you and wanting to man this is so yeah this is so crazy yeah that makes me so happy man one of the best moments I I like most Joy I feel cuz I mean this is extremely happy but this will like f like dopamine you know like tomorrow we'll fade away but seeing from all those students a lot of them will follow the entire course and do something and get results and that's what happened with sheep fast and the she fast testimon the greed of love like the wall of Love on cheep fast is probably it's honestly my happiest place to go on the internet go there and I see all those people who at some point trusted me give me a little bit of money and then got RS and like thank you Mark I quit my job thank you Mark I make my first doll on the internet like I love making software but digital product and info product like this how much happiness it brought to the person who make the the info product crazy crazy crazy crazy I got in the bank and I the simple analytics [Applause] guys oo where oh a little hello I am still sick but we're doing it anyway uh it's been almost 7 days I launched cast and this is a little recap of what happened uh it made close to $200,000 us in a week and this is absolutely mental I had no idea it would work this well I knew it would work somehow I'll show you why later but this much man this is just crazy so I want to break down a few things about marketing and finding ideas first let's quickly look at the launch uh you can see here uh this is number of visitors so almost 50,000 visitors and uh whooping $4.4 generated per visitor which is again this is insane I've never had this before the best product I've had was ship fast and he was close to $2 per visitor at his best so this here shows me like there is something big coming Revenue wise it's mostly coming from Twitter uh YouTube and a little bit of LinkedIn and I guess Google or people who've heard of it on social media and search for it I'm PR impressed by how spreaded it is there there's like purchases from a little bit all over the planet which makes me very happy so um I saw this tweet from Max a couple days ago that he thought the course would never sell and there are a few things at play here the first one is when we come up with ideas on what's to build what is what could be a promise promising idea you want to check a few boxes one of the first one is you want to build something that solve your own problems I see too many people coming up with what if I combine this Tech Plus that market and I make a product out of nowhere the problem with that is like it's pure blind guesses and well it's fun you can ship an idea in one week but but the odds of success are very unlikely product like this one's invoice this is not making crazy amount of money if we look at it is making around $1,000 per month but it's zero maintenance zero customer support it's fully on autopilot and it's working like clockwork every single month and I know it would work because I experience the issue I know that when I pay invoices on stripe I have to give them 4% to generate a PDF and so by solving my own problem could potentially guess that some other people have the same issue as me and so that almost guarantees me that if I build a product I will have customers now I knew how to code already I don't need a course to learn how to code the reason I came up with this idea is because I have a YouTube channel and I read every comments on this YouTube channel and one of my best performing videos if you search for how to you end up on finding gems on what people want to achieve how to buy domain name for your project how to build this amazing UI Builders how to make a responsive website how to make those websites seeing these comments over and over tells me that people somewhere on the internet have a problem and it appears that I have the solution cuz I know how to code and this this is how I came up with the idea of code fast a course that teaches people how to code to build those tiny businesses if you go to udm and you search for JavaScript or react you will find hundreds of Great Courses already so with SC fast I knew that there was a huge demand and I also knew that the market is very competitive and when you enter a competitive market you want to have one marketing angle you you want to have you want to find one thing that sets you apart from all the other competitors and the good part is I use UD me myself to teach myself how to code and I remember seeing those courses where you would have 68 hours of content for JavaScript and then you would have 70 hours of content for no JS and another 30 hours to learn HTML and then in the end you would have like a package of like 300 hours to learn how to code the reason those courses are so long is because they are main for people who want to have a job and since the job market is a zero sum game which means that if your neighbor gets the job you won't get the job you have to compete on who has the most skills so in this case it makes sense to to learn as much as you can so you can compete better against others but the thing is in my case I only care about making tiny websites on the internet I just want to be me my computer a few of my customers and that's it I'm not I don't intend to build a massive app for millions of people that requires a team of software engineer to handle and because of that those courses here are like a pain for me I don't want to go over 300 hours of content and this is how I came up with this idea of a course that would teach people only the minimum the the those core skills needed in order to build a tiny internet business and just like this I had one marketing angle that set me apart from all the other alternative and on top of that I remember when I learned how to code it was a pain to search for what should I learn what is Javascript what is HTML how those those thing combine together what is a back end what is a front end I had to think about how the the entire thing works what I did with cast is I bundled everything I explained uh students how to go from literally zero to an actual finished product is not about a specific part on the journey it's about the entire Journey which I bet is one of the reason the launch was so successful and then there is another one mistake that I see lots of people making my friend Yuri asked me what would you do with the money and then it made me think okay if I don't have to work for money what would I do with it and I realized that actually I want to build an alternate school for kids who were not good at school or for people who just don't feel like life Clicks in in general like like finding a job or like working for a big company or whatever for people who just you know want the freedom of not being dependent on others just have a computer and be free that is for some reason what is driving me and if you look at the Journey of everything I built everything resonate with what I want to do what goal I want to achieve now if we look with one of my very first product which was called viral buts it's a little software that uh that made my first internet dollar and then somehow let me move to Bal because he was making a little bit of money here I was helping escape room businesses get more money it was like a marketing tool for businesses and he worked he made a couple thousand per month but it did not resonate with me I have close to zero care for the escap room businesses I I don't specially care about them I care about people who want to do s with their computers but a business I'm not so sure and these product never really took off because once again it was not align with things I do things I like and I see lots of people out there who again are trying to combine uh this tech for that market but they don't care about the tech they don't care about the market and they try to make something out of that but I feel like there's a sort of like a a power that knows how much the product resonate with you what is the fit from the thuner and the product and I think if you want to get reach you have to do something that aligns with yourself okay now talking about marketing um of course having an audience on Twitter and YouTube really helps launching products but uh if you can see here this tweet got 1.3 th000 likes this is the only promotion I've done for the course and it would never ever get half a million views if I didn't have make this video here it's a skit where I play morphus in Matrix and I try to convince Neo Who currently has a 9 to5 job to quit his job and learn to code for himself the reason I did this is first because I absolutely love making this kind of videos but also because it works well it's like an ad that's pleasurable to watch and even though you're not necess interested in what I have to sell you might want to share this to a friend because it's fun and that's how this tweet went viral and got half a million views the launch part of your product is very important you want to uh craft everything to be perfect when you launch and just like in real life where conversion rate matters that improve the actual conversion rate of the product so even though you don't have an audience you can play around with writing a beautiful story of how you came up with this product idea you can go on figma and create a beautiful chart that explains your product you can make something that gives a good first impression for your product okay now I'm talking about what is next for cut fast uh at the moment I'm recovering from my sickness I couldn't work for the past 3 days I've set up an affiliate program where um people can uh become Affiliates and then they would earn 30 30 to 30% commission to 50% commission uh since the conversion rate is really good on the site Affiliates are already making lots of money at the moment I think they're making over $1,000 per day I added this little uh slider here that gives an idea of how much money you can make if you get I don't know let's say five people trying the course you can make actually 300 bucks and at the same time I am trying Facebook ads so uh the campaign has been running for just a couple days I think the first day Facebook was learning who is the audience and then now the results are pretty impressive yesterday was $60 per purchase today is $13 per purchase which is extremely good really actually really really really good uh it's early to tell how far they would go for now I'm only spending I think uh $70 per day for The Campaign which is not uh much but I think in this case it's worth the try because the product converts really well and I've had luck with ship fast in the past where I would spend $50 and get $150 uh in revenue for this I am not alone my good friend Nico janen is helping me run those ads is excellent at Facebook ads and he buil this little guide here called makers guide uh which I vot and it's excellent it teaches you everything you need to know to make good ads on Facebook so if you have a product that you think is worth sharing through ads definitely check it out it's a masterpiece and then as soon as I'm recovered I am going to work on the AI teacher so I want to train an AI on the course so it knows the captions it knows where the student is in the course at the moment it knows the code of the course and is able to help the students learn whether it's explain things or debug when students are stuck I guess I'll will need a little bit more of those Ginger cheese we're so back oh my God spent an entire week I was sick and it's the first night of sleep where I sleep properly and that was a crazy week I wish I was nut sick and enjoyed a little Bard but still the week was completely crazy I know some of you got the course out there thank you for that and I'm very excited for your coding Journey learning how to Cod change my life I hope he does the same for you um I'm going for a surf session one of the last of the year because we're going to Portugal with my wife in a couple of days uh if you're in Portugal I'll be around AR area and Lisbon just drop me a DM somewhere on Twitter and maybe we can do something the this is one of the happiest moments of my life and it only happened 27 times there we go my man there we go that's my 20 27th I think project whatever they're not all on the wall but all the ones that I built recently are there and uh this this little portfolio of small bits is growing EX excited for 2025 I almost forgot this is likely to be the end the final vlog of the year so it's good time to wish you a merry Christmas if you celebrate and of all just a happy New Year and crush it for 2025 until the next one I hope you keep shipping

TITLE: How I grew my SaaS to $4,000 MRR with cold emails (developer VLOG)
VIDEO ID: KJb_nfR6gJk

================================================================================

one cold email $4,000 and there was no customer support whatsoever we need one cold that's it and that's the first making money other the balls meet Mark Lou a millionaire who owns exactly zero pairs of shoes and way more startups than You' think is reasonable he sits here in this disgustingly beautiful Tropical Paradise to show you how to turn ideas into trans strangers into clients and your boring job into a distant [Music] memory we finally made it yeah we freaking made it with maybe 6 hours delay but we made it yeah we got the Visa we have a fly ticket we're freaking ready to go to Australia to meet that person meet some we finally arrived Australia it was supposed to be our healing trip but the first day is totally brutal yeah it was crazy hopefully we can get a car rent told now ah Australia what's up that pretty good now it's 400 p.m. we tried to eat dinner before five Mark is actually having a little struggle to disconnect we can talk about it during this dinner yeah e you yeah yeah okay let's do this that looks good so actually this morning we had a little talk no yeah I'm kind of made a mistake today by opening the computer mhm cuz once I start working I kind of stop thinking I have to write about thinking about the tweets I'm going to write build features I have to fix bugs so many things and once I see something then it kind of never stops and it's like infinite treadmill you need to find the SA way to work well but also have a good rest to disconnect from work to have better ideas to do up or and out yeah I think you need to work whatever if you want to make something good mhm but honestly I think you can start with a couple hours like an hour a day I think it's a miraculous amount of time and when you have a constraint and your brain knows it has a limited amount of things those constraints create creativity MH because you know you only have one hour because after you have kids or you have a job now my weakness is that I have so much time because that's my work that I'm getting drawn into it and I'm not creative I'm less happy I burn out it's interesting because when you are Indie hacker people recommend to start side hustle along with your main work to like um risk management of you know yeah and also for that mindset your constraint actually make you like success faster because you don't have a pressure to succeed fast so if you just start don't quit your main job keep it and also use that rest of time wisely to work like a 100% yeah you go full time and your brain starts to have expectation imagine you spend you work 66 hours a day for like a month without taking time off at the end of the month unless you've been doing this for years your brain will expect results it's It's Perfectly Normal yeah so e it's so easy to burn yeah discourage burnout there's my brain that is like how much views are we going to get how much like is this we going to make how much money are we and man this is so stupid because I have not started the journey for that it's addictive I get drwn into that and I don't want to I need to write a plan of all the metrics I want to track making one video per week is something I really care making thoughtful tweets to help people get started building apps I want to keep making apps like I used to I think I'll take a day off a week now mhm I think that's important cuz human beings are not made to sit down and look at the computer for 24/7 I think relationships in this larning journey is very important at the beginning it's pure Faith like you you see sh for month nothing happens and you even start doubting about yourself are you good enough am I good enough mhm when you have someone that you can trust that tells you I trust you you're going to make it this is like a it's a superpower sometimes it's hard to see your value by yourself and you can be the worst enemy telling negative selft talk so that's why outside objective you is important and that emotional support really means a lot yeah should we turn off the camera and enjoy the yeah this is freaking good yeah everybody's [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] good it never gets easier I 30° outside it wasn't easy that was a mistake but it was very important for the mental health we talked about all to be continued 8:00 a.m. camera is rolling yeah what's your plan bro what's the plan bro um hike in the morning mhm then uh try to find some good food then we are going to see kangaroos because we're in godamn Australia and then we're going to meet that person that special person that special person Chang your life yep 7 years ago W big oh hey it's beautiful wow imagine going all the way down to Australia to eat ital so cute yeah so beautiful we just have a lunch like it was so amazing with the homemade olives and it's always about no it was about having a time off to refresh our mind and then ready to go back to work just ship it to ship it what day have a life in a Solo preneur I don't I don't know if people actually have a clue of what we're talking about but we're going to meet the my first ever customer and I person changed my life and and your life too we went from like doing zero on the internet to making the first dollar with that customers we're going to meet back then I also meet my good you know him too my good friend Andre and he told me like sell it before you make it and I started to color collect emails of escap room businesses across the world that person said yes to the email so we jump on a call and I Tred to sell her like I was in my head I was completely thinking like an engineer so the call is super awkward I recorded the call and I'm like uh you uh I I I I I I built this this tool so um I um um I sent you um a demo of the of and she's so kind and she's like oh okay yeah that's that's sound interesting and she said yes and she spent around in toal I think around3 or $4,000 for the software one call emails one call $4,000 M crazy one of the reason most entrepreneurs never make money is because they build things people don't want and so if you don't ask customers before you're just going to end up spending 3 months building a product that nobody will want cuz we convince oursel oh this is a good idea this is going to work the truth the numbers shows that most of the time nobody wants the product what made you convince persuaded the customers to buy your product I make it sound like a no-brainer I told her this cost this amount of money and if you use it well you're going to get 3x the same amount of money I was I'm really sure of this was ever going to work in the worst case I can refound her if I messed up in my calculation so there's no big deal there's no string attach it's not about the product it's not about your product it's about the outcome for the business when you invest in the marketing tool it's like you expect a return on investment on the call I would use that to explain more how this would work see their objections see where they tell you like ah I'm not sure M so ask questions because you might realize that your product is not a good fit and instead another product could be a good fit and you will be surprised how much people are willing to let you know their struggles what else can I help you with you know is there anything you struggle with that I can make easier for you that is the right mindset I think to have and it's it feels much more genuine to sell something to someone that way that's true so cute I don't know who is the animal here oh the balls he has massive balls are you blind oh sorry are you okay they're all blind look at their eyes they all sleepy what is this kind of food like chalk oh oh so uh bummer the Escapo business was closed today today's Wednesday so we didn't get to see danela the owner of the Escapo business and I didn't get to show you my first customer but uh instead let me show you how I made $4,000 with one Cod email okay so we are early 2018 I have Zer I am doing some gigs for movies to make a couple hundred dollars a month so I can survive I need to make money so what if I help some kind of business I care about get more customers in using a product that I create what if I make puzzles for escape rooms that they can use those puzzles for them to get more customers so I go on yel I type escape room in whatever City I don't care because I'll never go there I'll use the internet to reach them out I pick any escape room then I open their website and here manually I go to the contact page and then I sell them an email this is a real email that would sent um 2018 I personalize every email so for that I use the name of the business owner to do that I go on the yel page and usually in the reviews um sometimes the the business owner would reply to a customer or a customer would mention a staff member that was really helpful I would use that email I explain why I'm reaching out I go straight to the point I'm trying to help escape room businesses increase their booking rate I personalize even more I say I know how much reviews you have on y but I noticed there is something you could do better I put myself as the bridge to get more customers and the C to action is you can pick any slot on my calendar I'm an engineer I feel super uncomfortable and it's somewhere in the middle of 2018 I flew to Japan cheapest flight cheapest guest house I have $0 I have to do a Visa Run and one of those leads decided to jump on a CO with me I wrote a few things back then where why having this marketing tool it would help them uh what they're missing out um I have a little plan on what I'm going to tell them but it's mostly me just awkward trying to to tell them something but surprisingly that person danela from the escape from business we were supposed to visit today uh decide to move forward and says yes I'm happy to get this going and here we go the ball was running I ended up making building the software for her it looks like this so it's on Facebook Messenger it's like a bot where it's automated messages so people customer their customers could go here uh start a little challenge they say oh I want to play the parking spots game and then the messenger bot would challenge them like here um there's was there was a murder in bangalo uh here are three potential suspects which one killed Rose there would be buttons for people to type there are like 10 20 games like this that are built and in the end the customer can get an escape room this is just 5% but you earn a 5% coupon for the escape room this would increase escape room business's conversion rate and just that one call with danela was enough to get one customer she spent I think around $4,000 on the business because she keeps paying for on and off four to 5 years just one cold email this is pretty crazy I would structure my days based on that so in the morning I would do marketing and sales so I would go back to yel Trip Advisor uh find five or 10 escape room businesses basically I would have different stages of pipeline the first one would be uh just the lead itself I haven't sent any email then would be stage number two I sent one email two email three emails and then at the fourth email I would just move on and close it I would automate the email sending so every time an email has been sent on stage two if it wasn't uh replied from the customer it would move on to stage three I would have four templates one per stage to make sure that I'm not missing out any leads and this was 6 years ago and now the business is closed Co basically killed the business here uh 2020 espr business is closed but as you can see it went up to I think four a little bit over 4,000 mother must recurring Revenue which is just excellent for me I was so happy because it was my first dollar on the internet uh the entire business was built on top of cold emails that said that's the only thing I did that worked he made around $770,000 plus I think around $1 to $15,000 on PayPal and this is just me doing cold email for like one year or something and what's even more crazy they have the customers who ended up loving the product so much they spent 13,000 us on this product and there was no customer support whatsoever we did one call that's it that's why I think Cod emails for any B2B businesses are really really underrated and should definitely dig somewhere here I also learned how marketing because I am a developer and it felt so awkward to sell something and some people say like sorry I cannot afford it right now and I realize this means that she does not see the value in the product but of course she can afford it if there is the value all those learnings from C emails and calls which are very hard to do are very Foundation of marketing that's why I really recommend start with a random business idea just pick something that exists already where you see money is already flowing find a way to make it yours add your signature me it was adding little games make turning the like marketing things into a gamification tool you might not build the exact business you have in mind right now but you're going to end up making something people actually want and that's the first step into making money on the internet how was the workout holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you scared the of me I just came back from kangaroo lens and I have so much work to done so now it's time to look in this is happening um YouTube sent me a little message the say it's time to celebrate I'm going to redeem this little thing right here it's so fun because I still watch a lot of YouTube videos and whenever I see a Creator showing these in the background I'm like a that would be amazing to have this in my room but it's impossible and it isn't it's it's real uh I'm going to show you the process how that goes okay so they gave me this little uh code here and I can redeem the award I have no idea what's next there we go this is the thing that's going to be in the room in the background oh I can input any name here okay that's going to be displayed right here approve and check out and there we go it's shipping to friends it's taking about to 3 weeks and I think we should be around friends in a month so uh yeah prepare the unboxing in the next videos I am trying to grow this software data fast to $1 million uh now what I mean $1 million it's the valuation so if we uh take a four multiple which is a generous multiple for software uh we take the monthly recording Revenue so 21,000 in monthly recing Revenue uh annualized on 12 month that's about a quar a million dollar times 4 that a million dollar valuation uh now I'm far from there this is the actual monthly recing Revenue 642 in Mr um which is not bad for a software that is about a month or two old but we're far from the 1 million in valuation so what I did recently is I asked on Twitter Hey if you visited the site but you didn't sign up why and surprisingly I get so much good valuable information uh there was this one from Kites that says I'm not sure if it's worth the hustle to migrate all my data to your software and so what I'm doing now is I really want to focus on building features that help people grow their startup with data actionable data that tells you exactly how to grow your startup data FAS knows what your site is all about and it also knows analytics my goal now is to build the right features to help customers grow their business so the new feature I built recently and I'm super excited about is the customer Journey it basically gets all the customers and check everything they've done before signing up uh for this person uh tomaya I can can see that this person found uh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fast on X I can see what the person did so they visited the site two time and then they purchased and I can look at for different customers for instance um this one I can see what they did on on November 1st I can see what they did after they even uh sent me an email and then finally they ended up paying this is just the beginning it's a very early version but basically is going to track any goal that the user has in mind until the entire Journey from the moment the person visited the site to the moment they completed the goal and as a little hint I'm going to use that later to give some actionable insight another things I did which is also really useful is when I get events from stripe called the web hook events um stripe tells me for instance a customer check out but fail or or customer just cancel their subscription and so I built lots of little robots on my site that listens for those events and send emails to try to understand why the customer performed this action for instance I set up this email here that says um I noticed you just cancel your data fast subscription so right after they cancel your feedback could help me improve data fast if you tell me just why you cancel I'm just curious and now I'm getting pretty decent replies um I think what the person means here is that he doesn't see the value in the software yet so back to the initial problem but uh it's good to collect feedback and know exactly why people take the time to visit my landing page and not sign up look at this big musle what kind of YouTube channel is not Fant shoe it's a fitness channel oh man it feels so good to be back Australia was so good but the routine we have at home nothing better than that and you know what what logo fast the free logo M maker I built one year ago guess how much revenue you made 1,000 it's a free tool it's a free tool yeah oh 3,000 in total you made I need a to take me home I can't see is where my house gone think about you all the time and I just can't see to make you now

TITLE: He hacked my site... so I paid him $300

================================================================================

so a random guy hacked my site and he let me know by email I sent him $300 to thank him but not a good looking day today well so we missed the flight it's [Music] real I don't even know where to starts happy birthday to you happy I have all the the zinc on my face oh man this is the most Bell F French belly gift you could ever make Blow the candle and make a wishes what is your wish I think I just wish us good health and peacefulness I'm a you like a lion after eating laa it's a voice like happy birthday to you Surfer surfing h I am so excited because my portfolio of software is about to reach $10,000 per month so that include all the little startups here except chipas which is not a software and I'm so happy because uh I I'm doing it breaking the two fundamental rules of Entrepreneurship the first one is about Focus you can hear everywhere that entrepreneurship is about focus focus focus it just doesn't work like this for me in my brain I like to jump between different kinds of projects startup a on Monday startup B on Tuesday that just something that I really like and the good part about it is that I don't I cannot I cannot be a perfectionist I cannot focus on tiny little details I have to go straight to the essential because my time is limited and that forces me to build only what matters for customers which I think is a great framework for being productive and at the same time I'm also very happy because um this portfolio is about to make $10,000 and 90% is coming from one time pay payments except data fast which is brand new and also habit Garden which is my first startup the rest is coming from onetime payment so 90% of the 10K per month is coming from onetime payments one of the most common advice you hear out there is to have a subscription for your software I wrote and news later explaining why onetime payment is much better especially when you're getting started um you will see that you can actually make more money with one time payment because it's easier to sell uh it's free it's on internet if you want add a link in into the description I really recommend you to have a look and if you want to dive deeper into pricing because pricing is marketing and pricing is very important I made a video recently about five pricing mistakes I made it's on my YouTube check it out it's not a good looking day today why uh I think I got um so I'm getting at the moment I'm getting roasted on Twitter and look at that those are all all people trying credit card on my sites so they can screw whatever they can screw and for another business of mine just people just vote the app and then they start to dispute the payments it has 0.3% dispute activity there was like since this account exists there's been no dispute for a year she I don't even know where to starts so um haven't been working much on the product recently because um there hundreds of people thousands of people trying to attack my site my emails are full of spam my phone is full of messages from my good friends that ask if I'm okay I don't even know if I'm fuing okay and I just I just want to make startups on the internet God damn it okay so just a little bit of context two years ago I had Zer so I just focused on shipping really fast making apps really fast so I can get results fast I was just literally focusing on not being broke and then um that's that's that's how I ended up making all those websites here in the past two or 3 years and that's also how one of my startups took off so this here this thing here um is how I made more money than I thought I would ever make and at the same time I started to grow a following on Twitter and my audience went from zero followers 3 years ago to uh whatever this is now as well as growing a little following on YouTube and in my head I was still thinking like the same Mark I was 2 years ago where I was in stress mode and I had to ship really fast and so I did not change my behavior I kept shipping the same way I used to and then someday I saw this post on Twitter from Matt where he says that we should write test for our Co we should build uh secure apps and um he found a way to bypass the pay wall on one of my startup the post was made in the building public Community which which is a community of um this is the community I grew up with like a three years ago um some people there became my friends like real friends we see in real life and it's it's a beautiful Community because entrepreneur is really hard and this is a place where we help each other and usually when one of us makes a mistake we would send a DM privately to each other and try to fix it and when I saw this was made um it was nicely made it was ethical M did Mt did not disclose anything here but the fact that it was public I didn't know how to react because I thought just a DM could have done the same work without the harm so at this moment I just did not reply and then a couple days weeks later um Matt found another bug in one of my products and at the same time I I received this email from a student called Jonas and he found the exact same bug but the difference is that Jonas sent me this bug report through a private email and to thank him for uh the time he took to write the email I sent him $300 and I I wanted to show that uh there might be another way to report bugs and if it's done privately I'm even happy to pay the people who report the bugs so I made a tweet taking about the story so he hacked my site and I paid him $300 and then I talk about the story of you know everything that that happened and I think um I try to have like a little nudge in the end to praise in public and criticize in private uh these tweets went pretty viral and I think that was the the start of uh something bigger it really created a movement where on one side you would have people who have the same mindset as me that think bug should be reporting in private and on the other side um there were developers who think um apps should be shipped with more secure infrastructure and since the Twitter algorithm is always made for a good drama they started to be like a flood of post of people who disagreed on which what is the right way to do things and very soon I would see lots of post on my Newsfeed like dozens of post a day of people trying to find vulnerabilities on my site and posting uh ethically again uh what they found without disclosing how to reproduce but they would post publicly what happened in that Community those spot was usually got viral and I would get I would see like in in a very quick way I would see like hundreds of post in a similar fashion and since it became big like I I would receive like hundreds of of people trying to hack my site to find something to share on Twitter um then my server will go down or we'll just find lots of bug like robots I think it spreaded outside of our community and some people with bad intention from outside the community started to join this and try to hack my site but like in a in a in a filthy way and it would go as far as paying for app and instantly charging back pretending they didn't pay in order for uh well me to lose money and I think to prove a point and at this moment I was I was honest I felt attacked I really felt attacked um so I made a post which I think put it more oil on the fire and I also posted this uh this line here which I'm mindly proud of uh but I I got emotional so I started to block people on Twitter um I've never blocked anyone in 3 years I'm usually the labrador type of personality uh but I felt like it was too much for me to handle and I wanted to just close the computer and and not see that anymore but this didn't help in any way and he just added more oil on the fire so it would be more people trying to hike my site more people posting vulnerabilities on Twitter and and it was not easing the thing so I decided to cool down um turn off my brain and of course this did not make things better attacks keep going stronger and stronger and so at some point as I just made a video to explain the situation and apologize for my emotional reaction so this was an intense week but also a full of learnings and knowledge so there are two things I learned the first one is that shipping fast is important but shipping fast does not mean shipping irresponsibly especially now that I have the following so my my uh apps get way more users and more awareness in security is important leaking data or critical bugs are just not okay and I'm very grateful for all the people who reported these bugs so I taken all the tweets and I went through the code base of all of my startups to make sure that this never happens again and I also hired someone to help me secure all my ads and my second learning is more about communication where I could have avoided the situation if when I saw the first tweet I would have just replied neutrally to it I should have never reacted emotionally I should have never blocked people I should have used the feedback in order to improve my product I should have opened the conversation and I'm very grateful for the burg reports good morning we just woke up and three more people to go wow it's such a big deal it's crazy how do you feel you honestly it feels unreal because I've never intended to grow an audience on YouTube it's mostly just me sharing what I do M and honestly he really feels unreal so if you have someone who just start YouTube what would be the advice for someone who just start to find the identity and I think in the end is about trying to try to make try to make stuff not for YouTube but try to make stuff that inspire people just stuff that if it's not YouTube if it's not Twitter if it's not Instagram you could show that to someone in the street you'll be like well that's cool and because I have all my eight businesses to run Twitter and and a bunch of other stuff I cannot spend much time on YouTube literally I spend maximum one day per week on YouTube so how did limitation help you actually it's because I was limited that I I got here it's like it forced me in 24 hours to do something like this this little constraint like you have a 24 hours window do whatever but you have to show something in the end so the the the audio quality was bad the video quality was bad like everything was bad but I built the habit and then nothing happened for 3 months literally nothing and then I remember I made one of those video that took off like YouTube decided to push it and some of my previous videos were pushed as well like I think two or three of my other previous videos were pushed as well and within a month I would go from a TH or like I don't know yeah a th000 or maybe 5,000 to like 15,000 like it would like triple or or 10x or something I don't remember exactly but like boom one more person I think one thing that really helped see the outcome of your work as a collection of something not as the result don't see don't don't look at the number of followers don't look at the money just look at how many you've done if you make 30 videos and no one watched them you've made 30 videos this is 30 videos like I made 24 25 27 maybe now websites maybe they're on only eight that makes money maybe only one really makes money but still I made 27 websites it's me it's like it's my little collection right I'm so proud this will never go away it's like it's new identity it's now it's deep in my DNA it will never run away oh Noone subcribe oh no this this is literally What It Takes I skipped the surf session this morning because I want to see this and I cannot start a day without surfing so this is extremely extremely important this is a gift from my sister and her boyfriend it says 100K followers like this one it happened it's real it's real yes I guess it's time to thank you for watching my videos I I you know you never I'm talking to a camera at the moment it doesn't feel like it's a person but there's hundred thousands of you who enjoyed at some point my videos and Beyond grateful so well thank you thank you so much I hope I don't even know what to say I just thank you that's all I want I want to say thank you for these I do a I do 15 push-ups in whatever know pullup push-up yeah 15 pull-ups and 15 chinups and then a couple of maybe 60 push-ups then I go to the beach it's my favorite song We're supposed to go to Australia but after this crazy week just to take some time off we realized we need a visa and we didn't have one so we missed a flight we applied for a new Visa we're still waiting you're stay waiting looking at flights and and it's crazy because we're supposed to meet someone in Australia a person that changed my life completely and I don't even know if we could get there a

================================================================================

backpack this little backpack has eight tiny businesses very small businesses but we can move there anywhere we want are you ready let itce focus is overrated he almost guaranteed to make money wow hello the family just hello so where are we going now we're going to n p uhhuh um my parents decided to visit us in Bali for a couple days wow nice so we're moving the startup office somewhere else to a little Paradise Island it's like 40 minutes away from B it's a little it's actually a pretty big island we have this like very famous place where there's a cliff that looks like a dinosaur and uh you can go down the beach you can have fun it's beautiful they're going to visit that part wow look [Music] you so I'm uh I'm working on this new software I launched it a week ago it's called Data fast and it already has 300 in monthly recurring Revenue as well as 133% of turn rate which is not really good so what I'm doing is I I get each customer's email and I ask them personally with my Gmail account why you stop your membership what is the one feature that's missing in the product that way I hope I'll collect good feedback to make to build a better product as well at eventually new startup ideas honestly it's the boring side of things business owners don't really talk about but I think this has lots of value when you start talking to your customers they see the email of the person who created the product they used and they are usually providing really good feedback and I believe if I keep listening to them eventually I'll land on a million dooll software a day in the life of a solo partner wow this is the dad and this is Mom right here if you ever come to Budd this is a absolutely crazy hike the final step if we're making it to the beach like I think focus is overrated I think I've focused two times in my life and every time I burned out because when you focus on something you put on the time you put on the work you have expectations and then after 3 months if you have no results you just burn out so I never focus on any product unless there's a clear Market feed then I spend all my time on it because I know there's a proof which was a case for chipas on the other side if you don't focus on something and you keep building little bricks here and there you have less expectation for one product and then your head is you zoom out from the product and instead of like making Indie page the perfect link bio for entrepreneurs by adding more features more features more features I'm more like yeah let's tweet about this and tweet about that and then I try new stuff short stuff and then suddenly I didn't have no expectation that it would become a backlink Marketplace it's an interesting conversation so yeah yeah I love I love this conversation people ask you what is the standard of like uh choosing good startup best startup so that people can like uh drop out the best project fast and then move on you know but in the beginning in the page looked like oh this a p obviously you shouldn't really focus for a long time and you should move on but like a late bloomer suddenly people it kind of like a discover the new market by itself and people suddenly find their like own solution from there so it's about timing you know I don't I don't think I think in this Cas in Chast timing is mattered but in this case I don't think timing matters it's more about having my head I Shi the side project it's not a clear here go like no nothing crazy happens I don't ditch it but I don't focus on it I'm working on other products I looking at what's happening in the revenue I looking at what people say I looking at the customer support and then something sometimes at a random moments something clicks like it was the case for the backlinks and then I have so many like man this is this is the same thing for all of my projects even the SEO project I made I shipped like a two month two two years ago like little SEO project and then I moved on and then from time to time I add one page for ranking and then slowly slowly slowly it starts to grow and then after years you start to see things feedback from people like whatever something happens and that is this is just what happening with with indepent so the important thing is don't put the too much High expectation on your actions and then keep it running and eventually and one of the seeds will grow like later exactly it's like planting seeds so that's why sometimes they will just fade and then nothing will happen soil is not good and sometime they will grow very late and sometime they will grow because of another seed you planted later will make it grow and then it feeds by itself on the fairy back home I was checking my phone some YouTube comments and I see this question popping all the time about how to find startup ideas and now it's kind of easy for me to find startup ideas because I have like built 25 websites so problems happen all the times and when there's a problem there's a solution there's a great startup idea but the thing is when I got started I had zero business idea that I could build because I had no problems and I was looking for this creative idea that would be promising and eventually makes money but I I couldn't come up with any but I found the easiest way to come up with an idea that is almost guaranteed to make money there are already existing markets there are existing problems and there are existing solutions for those problems people are already paying for that so the money is already flowing there is no need to come up with a new creative idea sometimes the easiest way is to just replicate something that is already working and make your own version out of it my my 25th startup data FAS is just web analytics nothing special but the market is here people are already paying for these kind of tools so if if you're if you're if you're just getting started and you're looking for an idea to build could be an existing problem find something find something where people are already paying money for and make your own version of what you think the solution should be add your touch add your signature make it playful make it super easy to use add some some stuff that were not there already but make sure you focus on a problem that exists already and that people are already paying for it that makes me think I have tons of work to finish before the week ends and so it's time to go back to work I mean I think this is terrible and it it's applied from anything from lifestyle to business there people who don't want to change and then they feel bad when someone is trying to do a different way I don't like to wear clothes so being topless is weird or I'm learning how to code and there is this software engineer who's been here in the industry for 10 years he telling me you have to use this framework yeah I'm like yeah but this one looks like much no you have to use this like this's this this really sense of like this is the way things should be done and if you don't do that then you're wrong and when you're getting started you don't you have you don't have a confidence so you don't question that and if you do you still feel bad because in the end you you don't have foundation so you're not sure and you easily lose your confidence which is everything at the beginning when you start you need the confidence right cuz that's that's how you keep going where working from home sleeping 9 hours at night I would never believe it because I believed what I saw on social media and somehow by finding this little success and success and success I starting to follow my own way and I realize everything I've seen maybe it works for some others but it doesn't work for me and I wish I knew that earlier so I didn't have to pretend play the game that they've you know set up mhm and that goes for again like uh whatever whether it's like daily habits about sleep and not working too hard or it's about using these special new framework that the JavaScript engineer should all be using it's all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man yeah sometimes I wish I would be back in time and and see 21 years old Mark and just tell him come on bro just keep doing what you're doing like don't try to change don't try to please someone don't try to follow someone just keep doing your own way if you have this stupid idea follow it if you don't want to wear t-shirt don't wear t-shirts and who cares who says what he's a good man so my parents are visiting us in Bali and uh since they've been hosting me for 20 years of their life I want to kind of give back and we inviting them to beautiful restaurants hello very beautiful I think I can eat this make a wish what is your wish finished that $1 million I just came back from a delicious lunch with my parents and um I was surprised because my mind was some sometimes thinking about work problems always happen like all the time there are problems at the beginning there are problems when you start to make money there are problem when you make more money I think learning how to deal with problems is very it's it's a very important skill to master if you don't want this like entrepreneur ship thing eating every part of your life that's something I I wish I knew when I started the journey I so I I hope that's a little helpful here um and at the same time one of my other business is making is on track to make $10,000 this month this is crazy because it's running 100% on autopilot it's still early but I will keep you posted in the next video

TITLE: Why your side project makes $0
VIDEO ID: y3HV_KdGoZg
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3HV_KdGoZg
================================================================================

I have a little trick When I visit a website I go straight to the pricing section and within seconds I know exactly what the product does and if it's worth my time because pricing is marketing and it can make or break your startup when I studied the journey I was not really sure how to price my product so I followed traditional business advices but none of them really worked and I was stuck at $0 for month I build 24 tiny businesses and try all sorts of unconventional pricing methods and that's how I ended up making a million as a solo developer so in this video I'm going to share the five pricing mistakes I made that kept my startups from growing and we're going to start with the spiciest one subscription yep your software probably don't need a subscription model now everybody is saying that we should Char subscription because that's how we make passive income that's how we earn money when we sleep but they forget one thing people hate subscriptions as a customer when I see $9 per month I know it's not just $9 it's $108 per year and it piles up with my Netflix Spotify and Wi-Fi subscriptions and sometimes I just want to try the product so I have to set up a reminder to cancel the subscription to make sure I'm not charged for a service I don't use subscription raise objections in your customers mind and Confused customers don't buy so it lowers your conversion rate I would argue that it is as hard as selling a $10 a month subscription than it is to sell a $100 one time payment product let's take a quick example okay let's say we have two products one is a sub subcription product that cost $10 a month and that has a 10% turn rate so every month 10% of the customers will turn which means they will cancel the subscriptions and let's say we have a onetime payment product that cost $100 up front and of course no recurring cost after now let's say that instantly we get 100 customers for both of those products after one month you make $11,000 with a subscription product and you will make $10,000 with the one time payment product and um Until the End you'll make zero extra r Vue now for the subscription product on the second month you'll made 900 bucks because you had the 10% turn rate and you'll have another 10% of these 900 bucks so $810 on month three and by the end of the year you would make $7 7,176 and if you wants to make $10,000 as for the onetime payment product you would have have to wait for 4 years until you get the same amount of money so do you want $10,000 right now or $10,000 spread across the next 4 years your probably doesn't need recurring payments a lifetime deal access is a great competitive advantage against all the big software guns like cenly or typ form now it raises the concern of yes but what if people overuse my product and I end up losing money there are two cases first there are the negligible costs cost where it's so cheap that you would have your users to use the product for like 300 days every single day in order to lose money I'm talking about bandwidth I'm talking about emails well actually let me show you a little little example okay so this is the web traffic on all of the products I built and uh that is about 200,000 page views in the last 2 weeks so that's roughly half a million page views a month now if I go to versal for the same billing cycle this is about 266 GB of data transfer that's roughly the bandwidth now if we look at versal pricing I am on the Pro Plan so normally I get one tab included but for this example let's pretend that I'll pay 15 cents per gigabyte transferred so we're going to do 15 cents times 266 gabt and we're going to do times 2.5 so we round this to like a month of data that means I would spend 100 bucks a month with Verso one of the most expensive hosting platform out there in order to serve half of a million page views this is definitely negligible let's take another example let's go to my emails I'm sending email for all my mes for people to sign up for reminders and I'm even selling email in some of my products I send around um 150 to 200 emails per day and this is the bill I got from mail gun last month actually 4,800 emails send per month this cost $5 this is absolutely negligible cost and unless my customers would use the product for 300 days every single day I would never lose money on those costs and then there are the more expensive costs so that could be ads for marketing or that could be GPU open AI or database cost for your software in that case you can offer a credit base system for instance you can have an image generation platform where people can create photos of themselves using Ai and you could charge $10 for like 100 photos that way you get rid of the subscription headache from the customer's mind and you're sure that your customer never overuse your product if no one pays for your one-time payment product no one will pay for a subscription but if no one pays for your subscription product maybe some people will pay for one-time payment version of your product so shoot large at first and then refine later you can always add subscription down the road when your product starts to get traction now I'm not saying that subscriptions are useless and should be ignored one of my good friend Dan say that recurring value equal recurring payments usually subscriptions are great for B2B product but remember they come at a cost and it's worth exploring a one- time payment or a credit alternative mistake number two not anchoring your price when you buy a coffee based on where you are in the world or where you buy the coffee you would expect to spend somewhere between $1 to $5 but now when you're buying a software to generate blog articles with AI it's kind of hard to know what it's worth so as a business owner where you have only one pricing plan on your landing page you make your customer thoughtful because they have nothing to compare with that's when the price and core comes comes in a price enor is a marketing strategy that consists in creating an initial price so that customers can compare with the actual price you had in mind and it will make this price more reasonable by comparison let me show you a quick example of how I do price anchoring for all of my products okay first let's start with an example of Zenvo it's a little tool I build for people to avoid paying the stripe invoicing fee of 4% and so in the pricing section I have this price which is the one I wanted to go for $69 um I'm not sure why I wanted to press it that way but that's what I had in mind when I got started then I needed a price for people to compare with an Anor price and so I created this price here which give you access to very similar feature except that with the more expensive plan you get the unlimited strap accounts feature and you only get one strip account with this plan so this one in comparison looks cheaper and more reasonable let's take another example of Indie page it's a little Linkin bio tool for people to Showcase their projects their portfolio and um I wanted to go with lifetime deals I never wanted to charge any subscription here so this is the price I had in mind from the beginning you pay $45 and you have access the product for a lifetime now again what's the worth of this what is the worth of a linoln bio tool that's why I added this like one year pass plan it has the exact same features but the difference is that after one year the pass is removed and you don't have access to the product which makes the lifetime deal planned reasonable and cheaper in comparison so so try to always have a price anchor to help your customers understand what your product is worth and you can even decline your price in three categories good better and best it usually works pretty well but just avoid having more than three prices because then it becomes a burden in your customers mind now let's talk about mistakes number three this is one of my first startup 150,000 visitors and $6,000 in Revenue unless you're watching this video in 20150 you remember how Facebook started a free app that's free users loved and spread the word so that everybody knows about it and it's going viral and they're starting monetization years down the road with ads grow first monetize later that's a good story but as a soloer the journey is a little different I value Freedom over unicorns I won't raise money so I won't raise a team of marketers and growth hackers I operate with fewer resources so I have to make some tradeoffs and removing fre plans is one of them let me show you the math behind that okay let's start with the goal first and let's say we want to make $33,000 per month and we have a product with a free plan and a Premium plan at $5 per month now as a general rule of Thum 3% of people upgrade from free to plan this is a standard in the software industry that means if you want to make $3,000 you will need 600 premium users which means you would need 20,000 users to sign up for your product because of the 3% conversion rate and to get 20,000 signups on a product we can safely assume you have a 15% conversion rate so 15% of people will create an account and start a free um plan which means you would need 133,000 visitors to get $33,000 a month I don't know how about you but that sounds insane removing free plan is removing pain as a developer I used to struggle to ask for money but here is what happened after I removed free plans from all of my products first I get better users users who are skin in the game they provided their credit card so they're giving me real feedback and I build better products second I got more motivation there's something magical about making money on the internet it's exciting and it helped me focus on the work and third I saved money most of the user base were made of free users so it's only costing something after removing the free user base there is no cost associated with that so consider ditching your free plans and add a pay wall of thres and that way you'll become profitable faster mistake Number Four free trials the problem with free trials is that people don't commit they can use your entire product for free for a couple days and that results in a huge drop in conversion rate after a couple days live got busy they went on a holiday and they don't come back because they didn't commit in first place now you might be wondering yeah but I want people to be able to try the product to know if it's worth it there are three ways to fix that the first one is to look upfront on your landing page usually if your landing page copy is not triggering an emotional reaction and there is not a clear demo of your software that means you going over a little camera and explaining demoing how the software Works customers don't know what they're buying so you can make a better landing page explain clearly what your product does demo all the features and that could remove the need for a free trial second you can offer free credits you let people use your software for a limited number of actions and not a duration for instance you could offer them to generate three images at no cost with your AI software generation tool or they can send 10 emails at no cost but make sure it's tied to an action something that they could perform so that after using your software for a couple of minutes they will face a pay wall and they know exactly what they're paying for you want them to commit when they are right now here on your landing page not days down the road and alternative number three you can still try free trials but reduce the length from 30 days to 7 days and ask for a credit card upfront an email is not a commitment a credit card is and final mistake pricing to chip I see lots of developers getting started who price like $10 to use their product cheap is expensive in the long run the value is what your product is worth its usefulness what's how much time people save with it and perceived value is how much a customer thinks your product is worth and it's influenced by factors like design and especially pricing when you price too cheap you signal that your product does not have value so as a rule of thumb always try to price a little higher than you think it's worth if you charge onetime payments avoid anything below $19 if you're charging subscriptions avoid anything below $5 per month and I noticed a side effect of pricing a little higher is that customers will value the product more and they will get most out of it think about Udi where you can buy this course for like $10 to learn the entire JavaScript world or you can have this like premium $200 course made by a creator that you love this is the course you want to go for because spending $200 on this course will make you value the course more and you will likely get more out of it and if you don't know how to price at all probably someone has already figure it out for you so look at your competitors and try to price in a similar range now this uh these mistakes I made um it's tailored for me and for the tiny 24 businesses I built it's also what I've seen from lots of solo developers building in public on Twitter but it's flexible that means you can come up with your own rules and I hope you prove me wrong and uh before we close this video I want to just mention that I am not affiliated with any of the products that you saw in this video I don't take any sponsorship on this channel and in fact I could not care less about the text tag I use as long as it's helping me move fast and until the next video I hope you just ship it [Music]

TITLE: I made $68,140 in August | Solopreneur Diary
VIDEO ID: agSU33udQCY

================================================================================

drums keep pounding a rym to the brain something big happened in August because of that burn out no it's way too cliche August has been a crazy month so let's start with the finances so this is what my portfolio of tiny startup earned in the last 30 days the the entire business is up 2% compared to July and it was the biggest month for one of my software in the page I launched the software a year and a half ago and the revenue well the revenue is has been doing something like this it's a little bit uneven but it's roughly going up and it's ranging between $1,000 to $3,000 a month as you can see there's like this Spike that happened last week because I launched a new feature and I learned something that I ignored for so long if you had to guess which of those two tweets made the most [Music] money in both of them I promote Indie page and both of them got around 300 likes and uh one this one is more detailed there's like a 40 seconds Lun video of me explaining the product I spent some time carefully crafting the copy and there's like this one where is just a screenshots and a link to my software and um this one made $100 in 24 hours this one made $1,000 in 24 hours here I'm promoting a new feature in the software where people can verify their revenue with lemon squeezy it's a nice to have feature it's cool but it's not necessary and here I'm saying that you get a nice backlink which helps you rank higher on Google I only track one data for all of my startups if I get 100 visitors and it makes $100 then it's a $1 Revenue per visitor this vitamin gets 0.0 8 per visitor this painkiller gets $0.45 per visitor six time more Revenue it's much easier to sell a painkiller and the fun thing both are the same product I'm just talking about different features here so even vitamins products can be turned into a painkiller for instance a habit tracker is a nice thing to have it's cool to track your habit but it's not a painkiller now if the copy is framed around the fact that if you don't track your habits then you're going to not stick to your workout routine and you're not going to lose weight or you're not going to get in shape this becomes a painkiller so by finding the right feature or the right angle in your product that is an actual painkiller and remaking your website copy your Ling page copy around the problem it's solving then you can increase your commer rate with minimal effort and it took me one year and a half to realize that and uh and overall the revenue Bas line is always a little higher each month which is a good thing and um if you watch my previous video talking about how I find free tool free marketing tools to promote my business then you probably remember this little uh Indie page bot I created and um it it's 1.5 th000 followers now it keeps growing every day and it gets more likes more impression and I feel like this is one of the reason people are discovering the app more and more and uh something big happened in August I finally made $1 million on the internet after 7 years of grinding and failing 27 projects out of those 27 projects 10 of them made money so it was pretty hard for me to try to know exactly how much I've earned since I started so I bought this little display here and I created an app that is fetching all the revenue from my 10 stripe account and every hour it's updating the total revenue I earned since I started the journey and it's even crazier to think that 80% of that amount was made in the last 360 5 days I'll make an entire video of every failures I've been through and what I've learned from it there's stuff like this where like I would spend a year in my bedroom overthinking a startup but by not quitting I ended up winning and that makes me so so happy and proud of myself and um I don't I don't like to own stuff so I don't buy anything except except when I broke those those boards here but this month I've made a little exception my sister was visiting me in B so we went to nanida a little island nearby B which is smaller quieter calmer and super beautiful and we booked an amazing Villa for a $600 a night which is a ridiculous amount of money to spend in belly but it was totally worth it the Villa was wonderful we had a good time there we went snorkling we saw the Mena raay if you come to Bal this is an amazing experience to do and my good Twitter friends also visited us so it was absolutely wonderful okay and yesterday someone try to screw my website but I was prepared let me show you so I built this tool here it's called bu disput it aims at reducing charge back disputes on stripe and this is for instance my dashboard with all of my startups those are the rules I set up if I receive a payment with a suspicious email I would like to receive an email and if a card is reported stolen or lost I would like to refund the last payment and yesterday I received four emails and in my alerts I could see that um four credit cards were reported stolen and by dispute refunded all those payments so I went on strip to check what was going on and those are the refunded payments and I see I have weird customers with weird names either because they're like I don't know too simple or the the the place where the payment was made does not match so I took the emails and I checked in my database and um and nothing really matches the person is called Scots the email address is something that have nothing to do with Scots it's a do ID like IND Thea all those customers look suspicious and I'm so happy my little software was here to code that because because I could have ended up with four disputes and the fact that everything happened within a two hours window it made me think that someone was trying to screw my startups but I'm getting used to it now and I absolutely love this startup uh but the problem is not making lots of money I think it's making a couple hundred per month which is absolutely not crazy and the problem is that I don't really talk about it because it's like an insurance company I have to remind people that there is a danger with your STP account it could be banned from one day to another this actually happened to me and the thing is I need to spread fear to market the startup and I I just don't like that so I don't do it a lot but I'm just happy it's serving me and a few other customers and it's pretty helpful so far I'm recording this video on September 1st and today is a little special day one year ago I made this video all right so what do we have Here solo preneur 27 years old because of death burn out spend 3 days sending up gns record and E emails ended up in the span folder anyway well that wouldn't have happened if he had used the ship as boiler plates I launched this little startup a year ago and this has totally changed my life so um a little little celebration today happy birthday she remember this guy we talked about him in one of my previous videos [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I love you too man and all you have to do is this habit tracker for developers this is is generous and this is also a good example of what the solo prer Journey looks like a tiny idea in mind ship it fast show it to some people see what they think about it improve the product with their feedback make a little bit of money grow a little following on Twitter Youtube whatever and keep shipping so that the journey becomes easier and easier thank you Max it's a beautiful product and keep showing us how things should be done and if you're interested in getting desk Hub I'll add a link below I am not an affiliate just a fan all right and um final thing for this month I bought this thing a big big massive uh book I'm reading it biography I normally read on a Kindle uh but I feel good sometimes having a little paper in my hand especially at night when I'm about to go to bed I don't want to have any screen and it feels good to touch paper and it's good to read big entrepreneurs biography uh you can see Ambitions were like all up there and me with my tiny projects I'm I'm way down there but it makes me feel good somehow that there's a new form of Entrepreneurship where less ambition more freedom simple life little bit of surf a little bit of daily life with a wife prioritize my sleep Etc um I like that a lot as well and uh finally I was looking for a new format for this Vlog to try to show you everything I do in a month as a solo entrepreneur I tried to chat with AI this morning um I'm making a video for YouTube for a title you might consider something like are you here are you there or am I talking I'm here oh it's way too cliche and eventually showcase the how about these title options no I understand I was trying to know if CH GPT would come up with a good idea for those videos but um it's a little bit cliche and it was nothing really good but the conversation itself with the AI was amazing it felt very natural like I could literally see myself dating an AI talking about life questioning it was really pleasurable so for now I'm going to stick to a monthly recap that is more settle more calm I'm here at my office sharing you insight about everything that happens in my tiny businesses actually I wish I would share more but I have been building something almost secret for the past 3 month and I am launching next month so I'll have way more to share and I'll be here at my desk but somehow it's a little shame if I don't show you some parts of belly because it is absolutely beautiful so I've got to bring you with me for this fin part watch this gu why W you give me why you give me that was so beautiful

TITLE: I made $66,700 in July | Solopreneur Diary

================================================================================

what I what I there there are three things I like in this world right it's time to get out of here I made $667 in July 20124 and I was on holiday for 2 weeks in this longer format Vlog I'm sharing everything I did in July as a solo entrepreneur who is not ambitious and build 24 tiny startups but first I I need to holidays are great but I need to go back to the office in case it wasn't obvious that I'm French Fu don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now look what I'm stuck with don't care if I'm in the room on July 3rd I did a podcast with stter story it's a big YouTube channel that tells successful entrepreneurs stories and how they got started the founder Pat walls is awesome we had a great time and if the interview is available I'll add the link in the description and it's crazy to think that two years ago I was a random guy in my room well I I still I still am but now I end up on like those podcast where I get a chance to tell my story those same podcast that I used to listen to get inspired and get motivated and all it took was building the right startup and since startup story is based in the US and I live in valy they send someone like a professional with videography guy who came to my house to show that interview and uh and that guy become the person who is editing those videos hey y I'm out here on the road you can hear little voice still get look the money speaking for itself I call it Fortune ta five top from a that work at corporate sales chinchilla youan we skiing out in Cor chel break the news they try to kill him but the boy prevails everybody's sleeping out there and uh I found my little office uh joke aside the entire EV crew is so friendly they just set up the entire space for me and everybody was so up to it all right so in November 2022 I built gamify list it's a little directory of gamified apps it has around 600 apps that help people achieve their goals using gamification and I built it just because first it's fun and second because I also owned a habit tracker that's gamified and I wanted to build like some kind of like side project to promote my habit tracker and the directory of gamification apps is the perfect place to do that but it appear there's some turbulences it's a it's a moving shaking office back then I had zero clue about SE and Google started to index and rank some of those pages and fast forward to today there is a constant growth in terms of impression and clicks and it brings around 100 clicks per day and somewhere in July I saw this app called Pokémon sleep it's making 100 million in profit per year it's and it's just an app that lets you grow Pokémons if you sleep well and I love the app that's why I added it to my repository this month if you've been watching my previous videos I'm looking for some kind of software where I can spend my entire day adding features and I hope to bring that software to a million dooll valuation I already have the idea in mind and I cannot reveal exactly what it's going to do cuz I get a bunch of copycats but I already have an idea in mind that I've already started building and earlier this month I run a design bounty on Twitter because I was struggling with uh a specific part of the UI for that application a design Bounty it's basically an open contest where uh every designer can submit their creation and the winner receiv some kind of financial reward was the first time for me to do that on Twitter and um I found a design that I really liked so now I'm just coding that software and I think I should be able to launch a first version by the end of the next month one of the biggest struggle and the biggest shift for July was uh my YouTube channel if you've watched some others of my videos you'll see that in July I've made a big change in terms of how I tell the stories I'm not sitting at my desk anymore I'm traveling I'm doing some workouts I'm wrapping those business encoding stories around like lifestyle stories just like this Vlog and um I'm having three times more fun shooting those videos and YouTube is giving three times less impression it's not that I'm doing those for the numbers but it's somehow what keeps me motivated to make those videos and at the same time i' like to have an impact so if you think is pushing my videos to more people then that just makes me happy and so I'm trying to find a good mix of what's valuable and what's fun my channel went from 5,000 to somewhere around 70,000 subscriber in the span of like 2 to 3 month and it was mostly because of three videos how many website I made my text Tack and how fast I launched assess these are great videos I enjoyed doing them but the problem is that I cannot replicate that all the time so I can milk the entire story over and over but you deserve much better than that and it's kind of boring to be honest that's why I'm trying to round those business story inside of a lifestyle Vlog so it's kind of fun new and different but YouTube is a mirror of what people think and since it's not giving much impression I also kind of assume that it's a little bit boring and this is pretty much where I am stuck at the moment I don't know if I should follow the number and keep doing the same videos that worked well on my channel so far or if I should just follow my instinct have fun and make more of those videos and I also shipped a new feature for my software called Indie page it's a Linkin bio for entrepreneurs customers can add their startups and connect with their payment provider so that they get a public page with a verified revenue and a few months ago I added a little board where those startups are ranked based on on the revenue in the last 30 days and I wanted to go a little further so I created a Twitter bot that every week shares the leaderboard for the past 7even days it also tag the person and on top of that it tweets three times per day when a maker is receiving a payment so if you want your daily dose of motivation I would add a link of the Twitter bot in the description it's the craziest setup I've ever I've ever done I think [Music] 2 hours transit in Tye there are three things I like in this world building startups surfing and skating in the airport my penny board not to loaded okay got toas I'm baby Chas too [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me so all right let's talk about Revenue all right so this is the revenue breakdown for all of my tiny project for the month of of July 2024 and the revenue is down around 24% compared to June 2024 and it was kind of expected because I was off on a holiday for 2 weeks I was actually a little surprised he didn't drop more than that because I was well I was completely off for half of the month which shows that I probably don't understand much in business yet talking about holidays oh the bur paining to you heart this is my little YouTube Studio for the next couple of second because my front neighbor think I'm doing something illegal by whispering to this microphone all right so talking about holidays I went back to my hometown in France for 3 weeks I usually never take time off because I love building stuff but that make a little exception for Summertime with my entire family we went to the south of France and we did some surfing cycling and hiking and this is usually how I get good startups IDE when my brand is rested that's exactly how I came up with my startup that's bringing the most Revenue then I went back to Paris I didn't see the Olympics but it was a fun exotic Vibe because all the Parisian were gone and only tourists were in Paris all right it's time to get out of here before the cabin crew opens the door ran little home just Landing in bing all right the final updates for this month is that they added a tiny feature to Zenvo it's a tour to over customers to pay the 4% fee to generate stripe invoices and as I'm getting more customers I'm also getting more feedback and one of them was to add the name of the vat next to the rate of the vat for instance in France we have to add vat next to the percentage the more customers I gets the more I realize that the entire invoicing system is very complex especially in Europe where each country has specifications and if I want to make this invoices compliant in most countries I need to cover lots of use cases and my my code is starting to look very um well I I had to recreate my entire invoicing object based on where I get the data from stripe whether it's a checkout or whether it's payment intent there are so many use cases that I'm I'm getting around a thousand lines of code just to create an invoice financially wise it does not make sense for me to invest my time on this startup but I still do it because a that's how I save money on the stri fees because I use my own products two because I'm also learning a lot about the entire invoicing system which is pretty complex and interesting and three because maybe by getting customer feedback I'll land on some kind of a new feature or a new product that can be an entire startup that makes way more money I am a big fan of Brian Johnson the the vampire guy I uh I invested a little bit of my profit into health I like Brian I like his Spite and I like how ComEd he is he's using his own product and it kind of remind me of what I do with with my own little startups on a much much smaller scale though and now that I'm back in belly I I really need to do that back to the office

TITLE: BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE

================================================================================

my wife is still sleeping it's almost 5 a.m. but I cannot sleep because today is a big day but let's talk about that later let's go to the beach first hey you don't watch that watch this time to [Music] Surf I love B the wings are so so good I have to work out every day but since the waves are so good I never have to go to the gy oh my God two boards two weeks at this point I might have to get a real job soon all right so this is yesterday night and that is today 100,000 followers on Twitter this is insane in this video I want to explain why it was the best decision of my of my life to uh try to build a little audience on the internet and how it change everything this is me thinking that I am the next Mark zenberu dollar ID and after one year it failed completely zero users zero doar of Revenue generation I failed multiple project and I always run into the two same issues first one is that I couldn't get anyone to use my app see if that spent month working on something and that nobody even cares what's the point I didn't have money to run ads and I don't even know how to run ads anyway I didn't want to raise money from VC because I want to work solo with my computer and second I felt so lonely no one in my family is an entrepreneur no one in my friends back then was an entrepreneur so I started with zero knowledge I didn't learn anything from anyone I didn't know anyone I could ask proper questions and so in 2021 I burned out after failing for so many years I was so angry at myself for being a failure that I punched the walls in my room and I decided to quit entrepreneurship and get a job as a software engineer while I was working for a guy that you probably know Ty Lopez knowledge who was not working from his garage anymore back then I discovered cryptocurrencies and I had to go on Twitter to retweet some stuff about nft and for the first time in my life I opened the application Twitter and I was like what if you know I'm just curious and I go over the news feed and I remember seeing a tweet from someone that changed my life I don't know who wrote that tweet but it was something along those lines I am a developer I work solo I travel the world and I make this amount of money I got fired a few months later but it did not matter because this tweet changed my mind and it made me want to go for this new generation of entrepreneurs so I restarted the journey with a totally different mindset I will share everything I built publicly on Twitter and I will try to connect with other entrepreneurs I showed up every single day and 8 months later nothing happened I was writing every day about the things that I was building or the things I was learning but no one really cared it was one two sometimes three likes and most of the time it was actually mine but it didn't matter because in those eight month I made a couple of friends five to 10 people who were doing the same thing as me and I know over the shoulders they were looking at what I was doing and that was just enough to keep me motivated because I couldn't just bust nothing so I had a reason to wake up and work on something that I would share with them it took 8 month to get 1,000 followers and then it took another 8 month to go from 1,000 to 10,000 and and finally took a year to go from 10,000 to 100,000 but it didn't matter because I was not focusing on numbers instead I was focusing on building cool stuff I was learning a lot building my own little portfolio and refining my signature until one day everything clicked so now I build a relationship with my audience they trust me with their attention so I'm pretty guaranteed that whenever I launch a new product I'll get a couple thousands of visitors so I never have to start again from zero at the beginning I would have to work this much to get these results and now with an audience it's the exact opposite and on top of that I got connected with amazing people people that I I never thought would ever talk to me I got the guy the podcast my first million that I watch every week in my DMs and Noah Kagan I did a podcast with him the CEO of absum $100 million a year and he's here wanted to make a podcast with me that's just crazy and if there is one thing I regret is to not have started earlier okay enough of me bragging now let me show you some guys who are doing it right and I think are going to explode soon okay first we have Anthony re Anthony reer anony he is a software developer and he's making the software to help uh Freelancers charge monthly subscriptions for the services the software is a beast very a bunch of really cool features and he's changing the life of its users and at the same time he's documenting his entire journey through very beautiful and well tell stories and at the same time he has a great sense of humor and then we have Max blade this guy is building a habit tracker for developers when you make a commit then he will show this on your habit tracker and he's documenting this entire Journey where it's stuff that we don't see normally like Hardware stuff it's very interesting and he is making really nice videos to share his entire Journey a which team grow from almost zero followers to what it is now in just a couple of week and this is amazing so give those two guys a follow there is just so much to learn from them see you at 1 million I broke a board this morning and the wavs are so good that I climb all the way up there those 350 stairs rush back home pick up this bigger board and came out again for those beautiful ways now that I'm about to upload this video I realized that it's been one year and one day I got married to this person and this might have been the best decision of my life

================================================================================

[Music] all right we are rolling I just bought uh ship fast.com for $5,000 us plus another $1,000 for the marketplace fee this is crazy because exactly a year ago I was making around $1,000 per month with my little software and I was counting every Pennies from uh domain names but also everything like food and accommodations and I was trying to buy the cheapest for absolutely everything and ending up paying uh probably what was my annual salary in 2022 for one domain name is just insane um and I was able to get here um because I've been grinding for the past 3 years until luck found me and one of the things that kept me motivated to grind was to compete with friends that's why I added a new competition feature to one of my software called Indie page let me show you you want to be on the Vlog hello rooster about a year ago I created a little software called Indie page it's like a link tree for entrepreneurs basically they creat their profile they add their startups and they have a beautiful uh public page and I wanted to bring some gamification elements so that uh people who need some motivation to get started or to grind and find motivation uh would be easier for them and I added a leaderboard it's basically uh taking every startups and every hours it's fetching the revenue from stripe and it's ranking those startups based on their actual Revenue in the last 30 days so every month people can compete to rank on that leaderboard uh this is exactly the strategy I use to grind for the past three years or so I was competing against my two friends Dan and Nico and you know we would share like who has the most like on the tweets and who has the most revenue on his startups and uh and this is really helpful for motivation hello something fcy boy such a beautiful s it okay one of the biggest update of the month is that I built my 24th uh digital product it's called Ino it's a little tool to collect feedback from customers it was born out of frustration CU Alternatives were either super complex or too expensive and I made an entire video about that if you want to check it's somewhere around here how I get the ID How I build it fast how I launched it on product hunt and got around 10,000 visitors and I actually got the product of the Day badge I was really really happy with that one of the questions I get the most on my YouTube is why do I build so many products instead of focusing on one in my experience there's a lot of luck involved in entrepreneurship um one of my product ship fast made I think close to $600,000 in the last8 months or so and I had zero expectation I really build it uh for myself as a codebase so I can ship faster and it was totally random and it's very hard to predict what's going to happen so the more product I ship the more bets I make and at the same time I learn so much from every product I make from um how to build faster how to make less bugs how to be better at copyrighting I'm learning about marketing like it's just a pure like Learning Journey that I absolutely love for instance a couple days ago I found this guy on Twitter his name is janjo he built a lit Chrome plugin in I think an afternoon or something that helps developers testing credit card with stripe instead of having to type 42 42 42 uh in the stripe checkout it prefills all that and you save a couple of seconds every time you test the credit cards and he sold that plugin for 4.2 uh per customer which I think is really smart and I think in a week he made around ,500 us just selling this little Chrome plugin and I think he after that he even sold a startup for another $1,000 so the guy went went from just about the span of a week it went from just having a random ID to building a product getting customers and getting Acquired and that's amazing CU that's so there's so many things you learn in this little process and that's one of the reason I'm very uh addicted and I love uh shipping so many product are you afraid to what you know is real like any other and we are live in B where the waves are crushing the show this month my family-in-law my Korean family know visited Us in belly I've been married to the lovely Korean girl behind this camera for seven years and they often visit us in belly or we go in Korea to see them I'm from France and so we mix a culture and is very very um C what what is mixing culture is very I don't even know what I was about to say with cultur different person she's from Korea I'm from France and being with a person from the other side of the globe has been so interesting and I learned a lot from it for instance in France if you say bonjour or hello with the not the perfect French accent people will say no bour and in Korea if you say like Hello in Korean with a very broken accent they'll be like oh congratulations they'll be very cheerful so uh it's very fun to mix cultures also I've been learning a lot living here in B I see how people live very different lifestyle very different mindset uh it's so just so interesting to see uh how different we can be and we can learn a lot from each other that's so beautiful I know what it is uh let me open it t it's here it's uh wa if you don't know what it is um it's coming from product hunt product Hunt is a platform for uh developers and designers uh VC startups whoever wants to launch product on the Internet uh product Hunt is the place to launch the startup it's a place where you can get um thousands and thousands of visitors for free actually when you watch this video there might be a video on my YouTube channel where I go over my strategy to launch startups and get traffic for free if you want to check it out and once a year they do this little ceremony where they select the best product for developers the best product for designers the best crypto app and they also select one maker of the year I don't know exactly how they select the maker of the year um in my case probably because I launched over 10 products on the platform uh the in 2023 and they gave me the maker of the Year award 2023 I'm so happy uh because when I studied the journey three years ago I would uh I had models I still have models like mentors people I absolutely admire like Peter LEL Danny bosma Timo maker those guys would get this maker of the Year award and I saw them as like some kind of rock stars and I would absolutely admire them and it would help me grind and show up every day and it's so unreal that it's here like I get the same a word as they gots it's I don't know it just feels really unreal and it's so beautiful but you can be literally no one at the moment like nothing that's working for you and showing up and and you know doing the thing I don't know you can you can get one of this like it tookes two years two and a half years and yeah thank you if you have been around for a while following the journey it really means a lot thank you you're ready to do it that's the place I surf every day cuz I I tend to overthink and surfing really helped me clear my mind okay uh what is your workout routine uh I don't have a routine I don't have much goals with workout I just want to be fit I don't care being bulky I don't care being a gym boy I don't care having big muscles I just want to be feet and lean and stretchy so I can do a bunch of sports so my routine is a bit different from the one you probably see on YouTube I don't go gym I don't take any supplements I don't lift any weight never lifted weight in my life I don't like lifting weight I feel like this is how I hurt myself and it forces me to go to the gym instead I am working here in my house every single day 365 days a year uh 20 minutes workouts uh 20 to 30 minutes body weight only uh mostly cardio and calisthenic uh I follow this YouTuber I love her name is Caroline gavon she's a beast um I do hold her all the workout she does that are not um requiring any weights uh and it's very short so it doesn't require much thinking it's not like a big hurdle I have to do so it's easy to get motivated but once I am in the work out I really push myself like crazy uh sometimes I even get dizzy I don't know if that's good probably not but I really push as hard as I can I don't think about anything else there's no phone distracting me uh I try to make more reps than her uh and I try to never have any break and if I feel like it's too easy whatever I'll do some ABS in between rests uh I would really get the most out of it like really pushing crazy for 30 minutes um and then I eat healthy foods so mostly vegetables uh nuts cereals fish eggs a little bit of meat um almost no sugar obviously no alcohol no cigarettes uh very no pizza pasta or almost never and uh yeah but no supplements but just healthy food is it boring no that's true also one more thing uh to be fully transparent I live in belly so I surf almost every day and when I surf I don't work out so obviously the results I get is results of Fitness like homeworkout plus surf uh but I've tried this like body weight Fitness only routine uh every time when I go on travels and my body stays roughly the same except that that my shoulders shrink a little bit cuz surf is a lot of paddling so it's a good shoulder workout but the overall body weight the overall Body Fitness is pretty much the same whether I do only workout or surf workouts mix let's talk about Revenue this month I made a little over $130,000 as a solo entrepreneur from nine sources of income and seven of them are digital product it's also the biggest month for Indie page my link in bio for entrepreneurs I'm very excited and this is where uh lots of my focus is going on at the moment in terms of money spent I spent around $5,000 for stripe fees so somewhere like 4% of all the payments um what is it $3,000 for ads around $ 1.5 th000 for Affiliates a little bit less than $500 for the Tex stack and $25,000 to Outsource a few tasks so that's around $112,000 of expenses which leaves me with $118,000 of profit I started sharing my Revenue publicly on Twitter when I started the journey three years ago and I do this for two reasons the first one is I want to remember where everything started and I want to remember that it took time and the second reason is because it's very easy with and the second reason is because it's very easy to say pretty much anything with a little bit of Storytelling so I'm not saying that the person with bigger numbers is more right than other people but I'm saying that it's so easy for anyone to say anything on the internet so I just want to add a little bit of proof here but for sure I'm still a total rookie in entrepreneurship all right and to be totally transparent with the Rue and this is the dashboard for one of my product called ship Fest uh this is the daily revenue and this is the revenue for this month I don't want I know you know already okay this has been a crazy month uh it's been a crazy year actually from opening the business here in Asia to changing my tax residency as well as you here launching three softwares customer support marketing Twitter YouTube um I still do almost everything myself cuz the the goal has always been to stay solo so I don't have any meeting I don't have any deadlines nobody's waiting for me uh but it's at the same time it's so uh terring physically tiring I really struggle to disconnect from work I'm looking for boundaries like where I can close my computer and be off work completely but this never really happens I wake up sometimes at 3:00 a.m. and my brain is fully focused on work for sometimes 1 hour or 2 hours uh yeah sometimes I just wish this would go away I hired a therapist this month to help me with bounding if I if there if there is such a thing in entrepreneurship but uh I kind of guess this is you never expect anything and then you have to deal with all the new issues new problems coming up um I also feel guilty saying this because I wanted I wanted this so badly and now it's happening uh there's a part of me that wish he would slow down a little bit uh but anyway it still just a wonderful Journey um the YouTube channel crossed 50,000 subscribers this month and it was about a th subscriber earlier this year so this is just this is just absolutely crazy thank you so much for following the journey it really means a lot um I read all the comments uh except the bad ones but I I read all the love messages um and if you're watching this probably you are not one of those bad comments so thank you for staying around all right until the next video I hope you just ship it cheers

================================================================================

by the end of this video you would have built a billion doll software and get acquired by Google so you can spend the rest of your life testing out every new trendy Tex tax all right I'm not so sure about all that but my promise is this at the end of this video you'll know exactly how to use the platform product tant in order to drive traffic to your website and grow your startups and you'll see that it doesn't require any prior experience or doesn't cost any money but why should you trust me well I got the maker of the Year award in 2023 I launched 21 products on product hunt in the last two to three years and I got 13 Awards and you will see that at the beginning I didn't get anything and then it got easier and easier so there are some knowledge that you can reuse to replicate the same let's go all right first product tun 101 and is it worth launching your startup there there's about 4 million visitors on the site every month and it's high quality traffic there are a bunch of designers programmers agency solopreneurs so uh the eyeballs you're getting there are very good if you end up in the top product of the day you can expect 2 to 3,000 visitors just from the platform but it's not it they also have one of the biggest Tech news Lor out there so if you end up in the top 5 to 10 product of the day you will also get shared somewhere there and you will add another extra thousands or 2,000 visitors to your site and finally there are a bunch of media that feed off product hunt because this is where the new trendy Tech happens so after the launch when the traffic goes down you'll see some spikes coming from other platforms and product tant is very famous so overall it's a very good investment for your startup all right if you haven't launched on product hun here is roughly how it works every 24 hours there is a new bunch of product that are displayed on the homepage of the platform and they're competing to get the most of votes the timer resits at midnight PST and for the first 4 hours there is no ranking based on ofos it's just purely random to avoid the winner takes all after the fifth hour the products start to rank based on their number of up votes and so it's a winner takes all game and if you're at the top you're almost guaranteed to stay around the top and if you're at the bottom it's very hard to claim up that's why the first four hours are the most important and in this video we're going to cover how to get the most up votes during this time there are two ways to get up votes on product tant and first is called the inbound upvotes the up votes that are coming from users who are actually browsing the platform and they find your listing and they decide to up vote it on the product hunt home feed there are tons of other products competing against yours for attention and the way you win is by nailing three things your name your tagline and your logo the name of your startup should be short simple and very easy to read and you would rather ditch uh like VC style names like stripe or Tesla and go for something very logic IAL like ship fast a tool to ship fast if you want a tutorial to make names for products I wrote a short article about finding good names for startups as a solopreneur in the blog in the description below next is your tagline and it's the most important part of your listing it should be very short like 60 to 70 characters maximum it should be one sentence and it should tell exactly why would a random stranger on the internet invest its precious time for your product it shouldn't be about your product but it should be about what it's doing for your customers uh what pain is it relieving how their life would be after they try your product why is it worth their time and finally your logo this is more the creative part that is up to you but if you see that there are many logos that are blue colors maybe go for a green that contrast well you want to stand out and be remarkable now if users decided to click on your listing there's two more important parts the first one is your Carousel of photos you can put I think up to seven eight maybe even 10 the first three matters and what matters too is that you keep those images super simple one image should be about one feature and if you want to add a screenshot of your product this is a very good thing but do not add the entire dashboard of your users for instance make sure that you zoom on those photos and you show only a very tiny part of your software as if the user was actually looking at uh your software very very close cuz nobody would read the text that's inside unless it's a big headline and the last important part of this puzzle is the first comments you the funer are going to write your little story how you ended up with this product ID as the first com on your listing this is very important because people relate with people and stories you are not a VC back company with millions of dollars for marketing who just want to make even more money you are a nice person who just want to quit their 9 to5 and you have a story to tell so explain why you came up with this product ID explain what it engag for you how much time you invested in it and the comment section supports markdown so you can add links for instance to your products so if people are browsing the comments you can directly link them to your product as well as link your social media if if you have a YouTube channel or if you're writing your journey on Twitter make sure you add a link to that part so they can start growing a little following that's going to be very helpful for the next part all right now the second way to get up votes is through outbound up votes it's basically anyone who is not currently on the product on platform but decides to come and help you for instance when I got started I would send my product link to all my family and friends and ask them for up votes but there are many other more reliable way the first one is Twitter Twitter and product hunt have a good audience overlap there are tons of solopreneurs on Twitter who have a producton account and they will be happy to help you and then it boils down to making good tweets so learn the basic of writing how to make a tweet that's easy to read learn how to make a good headline that catch people attention learn how to tell your story in a nice way that people can relate learn how to make good creative that will gets people attention for me it all started with fun launch videos back then I had a few hundred followers on Twitter and I would make those videos where I would go on a fake podcast with jogan or I would go in a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and this felt like me it was fun to make and some people on Twitter enjoyed it so they started to watch the video up both my product on listing and also reshare the link that really helped me boost the product on launch and that's also how I grew an audience I actually made a little course about how I make those videos if you want to check it it's in the description it might sound a little bit discouraging if you're getting started and you don't have an audience yet but remember an audience is not created out of thin air people follow you for a reason and that reason is because you might be the guy who launched a bunch of products on product hunt so you got to start somewhere build the audience or build the products start with the products launch things on product T and this is how you're going to get people follow you on Twitter that later will help you achieve more momentum for every new product hunt launches and of course if you're active on any other social media Facebook Instagram Tik Tok wherever this is you are make sure to share the links to your producton listing there to get some votes another way to drive out bone up votes is through your actual users let's say you have launched a product already and you have 100 active daily users or something like that you can tell them through mailing list or anything that you can reach out to them to help you support the product on launch if they're your users they probably already love you and it's going to drive some more upvotes to your producton listing and finally you want to add a badge to your website a little Banner top left bottom right wherever this is you think fits well that says oh we are live on product hunt for the next 24 hours we would love your support that is very helpful for two reasons first the product hunt users who clicked your websites and are now visiting your leting page it's a good way to bring them back to the platform to give you an extra up and second you can launch your startups on many other platforms at the same time you can launch on Hacker News Reddit Twitter at the same time and you can get extra traffic from those platforms when they see the badge on producton some of them will come and give you a little hands and up vote your producton listing this is what I do all the time I scheduled the product hunt launch and I would launch on every other platform so it brings an extra juice to product hunt and if you want to know how to launch on those other platforms I wrote a little something on my blog in the description okay now you might be convinced it's a good time for you to launch your startups but which day should you actually launch it depends on what you want if you want social proof or traffic if you want traffic Mondays to Fridays are usually the busiest busiest in terms of traffic people actually browsing the site but also busier in terms of competition so it's harder to get an award but it's easier to get traffic and since VC startups don't work on Monday at midnight I recommend you to start launching on Monday instead if you're looking for social proof and you want to get that product tant badge to embade on your site I recommend you to launch on weekends and especially Sundays are usually the calest days so you have let's competition and more chance to get the badge is your product ready to be launched on product well based on the T-shirt I'm pretty sure that you can guess I'll tell you it's time to launch it but I would argue that you should wait until you have at least some testimonials on your site before launching the reason is simple there will be tons of new people discovering your products so you want to make sure you have some kind of social proof because it's much easier to sell a product if people are already validating it and keep in mind that you can still relaunch your product a few month later and you can also launch some free tools to promote your main products so don't hesitate to launch as soon as you have social proof the first product on launch is hard and might not go as you expected but it's a necessary step if you're serious about becoming a solopreneur quitting your 9 to5 and become financially independent it's a tiny step that's going to help you in the future you're going to start growing a little audience on Twitter because people will admire you for launching your product so the next time you launch a product you can ask your audience to help you out which is going to grow a bigger audience and it's going to be like a little Loop that's going to keep going up and up and up and you'll see that after a couple of launches you're almost guaranted gued to have one of the product tant badge and you will as well get a couple hundred if not thousand visitors on your side and grown a little audience so my advice is to not overthink it just launch it and keep repeating the same recipe over and over until luck finds you all right that's it for this video if you liked it you can like the video and if you're looking for other ways to Market your startup I drop a link to my blog below where there are many other uh free ways to Market uh your startup and G customers and until the next video I hope you just launch it

TITLE: The EASY way to set recurring payments (Stripe subscriptions)
VIDEO ID: ag7HXbgJtuk
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag7HXbgJtuk
================================================================================

even though the stripe API documentation is longer than Lord of the Rings there is a very easy and fast way to set up monthly recurring payments for your software in this video we're going to uh create a little pricing table for people to choose monthly or yearly uh subscriptions we're going to deal with stri web hooks to make sure that we Grant or revok access to users based on their current subscription status and we're going to let your users manage their subscription whether they want to update their credit cards upgrade or downgrade their plans or even cancel it and you'll see that we'll be able to do this with just a few dozen lines of code for the tech tack I'm going to be using just a little bit of react as well as an API endpoint uh through the nextjs API route but you can use anything else like for instance an Express server and that's pretty much it if you're new here my name is Mark I have built over 20 products on the internet from AI tools habit tracker a few useless products and some software that I grew to a couple thousand in mostly recing revenue and this is the video I wish I found when I got started first let's start with a quick overview of what we're going to build on the client side so your customers they will be able to select a yearly or monthly plan and subscribe to one of them by entering the credit card details this is going to go straight to stripe create the subscriptions create the customers and STP is going to update our API through web books tell us whether or not we should give access to the user again for the API I'm using nextjs but you can use pretty much anything you want like Express and then once the customer has access they will be able to manage their subscription with the strap customer portal so if they want to upgrade the subscription download the invoice or uh even cancel it and it's going to update stripe and stripe is going to let us know again through a webbook whether we should update or not the user in the database before we start coding let's set up the strip account so make sure you are in test mode and then go to your product catalog and there you will be able to add a new product you can call it the way you want I'm going to call it hello YouTube and set up whatever recurring payment you want I'm going to start with a monthly recurring payment at $19 it's going to create the product you can click on it and you will see your pricing plan here start by creating uh a payment link so just click that button make sure you check this option right here if you work with uh European businesses that would let them input their tax ID so they have invoices with their vat for instance and on the after payment page you want to replace with a custom message that says go back to your dashboard and refresh it to unlock the services thanks for your trust you can create the link and you will create another link for this product so go back to your product catalog select the product you just created and we're going to create a yearly plan so we're going to add another price and we're going to say let's say $99 per year and create the price and we're going to do the exact same thing we're going to create a payment link we're going to allow businesses to input their V number and in the after payment page you can copy past the exact same message we said earlier make sure to say to your user to refresh your product page so that they get the latest data from your API and then create the link and and you're going to end up having another payment link for the yearly plan for each of the pricing we created we're going to did two things per pricing we're going to did the price ID right here as well as the payment link so the URL that you can copy right here now we're going to code a little pricing table where people can choose between paying monthly or paying the yearly and we're going to see what happens when we click on this link for that I have spin up a little next year project so I have this uh page this homepage whatever it is with a component called pricing the pricing component is important there are two things going on first there is this array of plans and you can see we have two objects this one is the monthly plan and this one is the yearly plan we have uh these data for visualization on the table component and we have the payment link uh URL that we copy past from stripe earlier as well as the price ID that we copy pasted earlier and because stripe has a test and a production mode I'm also using process.of not not environment equal developments when I'm testing on my computer and I would set this up to the actual production price when I go live it's important to export this constant here because we're going to be using it later for the web hook all right now we have the components the component is very simple it's mostly UI with the little use states to uh swap between different type of plans the yearly and the monthly ones there's nothing fancy here is just a purely visual what matters here is what happens when people click on the Subscribe button you can see we are going to open a new window and we are going to direct the user to the payment link URL and we're going to prefill the email with with prefield email using the user email for this part of the video I assume that you already have some kind of authentification system I'm using next oath for that as well as a mongodb database but you can use literally anything you want as long as the user is authentification you can pass the user email after the pre-filled email query and is going to prepopulate the user email and if you don't have some authentification in place already at the end of the video I'm going to ver a use case where you can start charging subscriptions to user that is not even authenticated so now now when the user click on the Subscribe link is going to open the payment link and it's going to prefill the user email so we can know who uh paid for this uh membership and then we're going to input some fake dummy data and see what's happening Mark and we're going to say okay and then we're going to back to stripe and if we refresh the page it is this one this customer was just created the subscription is active on stripe and the customer paid I already have a bunch of other payments because I'm testing it with my computer but normally you should have subscription that is active right here and on the confirmation payment page it says go back to your dashboard and refresh it to unlock the service okay now we need to update users in our database to know whether or not they have access and for that we're going to use stripe web hooks so go to your developer tabs and you're going to need two things first you're going to need your API key so you can reveal your test API key the private one and you're going to copy paste it in your project you can call your key whatever you want I call it stripe secret key and then just pass the key right after that because I'm using nextjs those are private and they will never be shared with the client but if if you're using react you want to make sure that you only share those API keys on your back end then go to the webbook part and you're going to say you want to add a local event listener you're going to type this in your terminal so stripe login is going to prompt you to log to stripe and once you're good with that do not run the common number two I'll show you the one we're going to be using so we are going to create a second terminal I usually put it uh on the right side of it and then you're going to use this common stripe listen-- forward to Local Host the port you're using usually 3,000 I call mine /i/ web hook slst stripe just copy paste this and press enter and it's going to set up a little listener on your computer and you're going to get a webbook secret signing key like this one and you can copy paste it in an environment variable called strip webbook Secrets the webbook secret is just a random number to make sure that the calls we receive from stripe are actually coming from them and not from someone else now that we have a stripe local event listeners everything that happens on your stripe test account will arrive on your computer and you will be notified in this console so if I try to pay again here you will see that you will get notified but it also works if I do actions directly on stripe for instance let's say I create a fake payment of $1 I create the payment and you will see that I will be notified here in my console I receive some events from stripe like charge succeeded payment intend succeeded and a bunch of other events and this is how we're going to update users in the database to know whether or not they have access to your product for that you're going to need a little API endpoint for me as I'm using njs I I created a/ API folder and in the webbook folder in the stripe folder I created a route where I have my API Handler if you're using Express for instance uh stripe has a nice documentation they will show you exactly how you do that if you go back to that developer uh page they will show you how to set up your Express server the beginning of the code here does not really matter you see we pull the stripe webbook secret and the stripe secret key here and then we're going to verify that the webbook is actually coming from stripe and then the important part that we're going to in this video is the events we receive and so we have a big switch and we're going to iterate over each events that we receive and decide which actions to take and for us for our simple use case we only have two events that we really care about we're using the stripe node.js package in order to uh query and interact with the stripe API so the first thing we do is we actually get the session object from that customer we're going to extract the customer ID we're going to get some more information about the customer we're also going to retrieve the price ID from the session so if you remember earlier the price ID is the little thing we copy pasted and then we're going to iterate over the plans our plans if you remember in our uh pricing component we set up an array with two objects each of them have the price ID and that's why it's important so that we can get the plan here if there is no plan it's probably some uh bugs or mistakes so we just want to break the loop and move on and then we're going to either create the customer or update the person if they already exist for instance if a customer paid and then cancel the subscriptions and then 3 months later came back and paid again we don't want to create a new customer we want to update them so it's going to check the customer email so the email that the customer inputed in this field here and we're going to search if that customer exist in our database I'm using mongodb this is how I query it it would be the same for uh anything else you're using if there is no user we want to create the the person so we want to uh we get their normally we get their name from the stripe checkout uh we also get the email and we get the customer ID it's a unique identifier in stripe that we're going to reuse later and then going to update the user um there are two things we want to update we want to say the price ID so they subscribe for that monthly or that yearly plan and we also want to update a some kind of Boolean for me I call it as access if it's true the user has paid if it's false the user hasn't paid we save the user and then we're done one thing I also recommend you here is to sending a little extra email like welcome to your product name here is your logging link or something like this to make sure that if the user move on after paying that they have some kind of backup on their email uh box and the second event that's is called customer subscription deleted so stripe will create a subscription life cycle for you when the customer start to pay for um that monthly or yearly membership and they will send you events frequently uh if the user has paid the invoice if the subscription has renewed cancelled uh upgraded whatever you only want to listen to the subscription deleted this is fired when the customer cancel the subscription and they reach the end of their billing cycle this is usually the time where you want to stop providing access to your customers so for that we're going to get back the subscription from stripe we're going to first retrieve it with the ID and thanks to that object we know uh the customer ID unique identifier for the customer we're going to retrieve it from our database this time and we're going to turn off their Boolean and save the user and this is pretty much all you need to have a subscription that either grants or revoke access to your customers there are also some nice tripe even that I'm going to share with you just in case you have some more uh complex or you want to do some marketing things for instance the stripe checkout expired event is when the customer don't pay and they leave the checkout page you can sometimes access their emails and this is when you want to tell them like hey you did not make a purchase here is a 20% discount for next checkout or something like that the customer subscription updated is fired every time there is some events like the subscription is renewed every month you'll receive an event normally you don't need to do anything here because we just revoke the access when the subscription is actually deleted the invoice payment failed event is fired after a customer was charged but it was not successful let's say your customers will have money on the bank account then you will receive this event in some cases you might want to block subscription right away but usually it's quite friendly to wait until the end of the billing cycle to stop granting them access so you would normally don't do anything here unless you want to stop the subscription right away after a fail payment and finally the invoice paid event is fired after the opposite happens so when a customer credit card is charged if you're using the previous even to stop giving access as soon as the payment is failed then in the invoice paid you might want to have the opposite effect which means that you get the customer and you give them access back every time they make a successful payment but again in 99% of the cases you only need those two events all right let's see what we have now so we can create any subscription I'm going to go for the yearly plan and I'm going to input some Demi data the test credit card is 424242 we're going to be in 2025 and I'm going to say uh I'm going to be John this time and then I can subscribe to the yearly plan in my backand I should receive the stripe events right here here uh one of those events is supposed to be called checkout session completed and this is where we're going to create our user in the database we're going to double check my mongodb making sure that it was actually created there we go when I refresh I see the user so I have those information so the name and the email provided during the checkout as well as some stripe uh information like the customer ID and the price ID and we can see that the user has access to the product so we can give him or her uh probably him in this case this is John access if we double check in stripe and refresh the customer tab we will see we should have a new customer created called John here we go and he has an active subscription now I want to test if the revok access is also working so I'm going to cancel the subscription immediately and on my backand I should also receive some new events somewhere here actually I received it already it was really fast customer subscription deleted which is the second event we're listening to this one which normally should update our database and remove access from the user we're going to double check that in mongodb again refresh and and we can see the user uh does not have access anymore so this is working okay now we want to let users manage their subscription so either upgrade plan cancel change download the invoice change your credit cards and all that things for that go back to your product catalog and pick the monthly plan and you're going to say in the upsell category say upsell to the yearly plan and then in the search tab type customer portal and in setting Billings customer portal you should have this page um I think I turned mine on already uh there might be a button to turn it on in the subscription part here you will want to uh select the products that customers can um subscribe or not so you will find your product here the yearly plan and the monthly plan save the changes and you're going to copy the link that is right here and then in your code so this is my uh homepage or whatever user dashboard page I created a simple react component button customer portal in this button I just get the user session so I know their emails and I also have the link I just copied from the customer portal and when the user is actually authenticated I just have a link that goes to that customer portal link plus I add the as before for the checkout the prefill email query with the user email in the end and then when I click on it on the user side it's going to open the striped customer portal with the email prefilled from here customer can receive an email to log to their customer portal and manage everything so this is my Gmail if I click here is going to open my stripe customer portal and then the customer will receive an email it looks like this and when they click on it they will access to their uh billing portal where they can update their plan or cancel it as well as changing their payment method adding new credit cards building information invoice history and a bunch of other cool stuff a few things once you're ready to go to production uh go to your developer tab turn off the test mode part and copy your actual production API key and in the webbook tabs you will have to add your own uh website so add an endpoints your domain name/ API webook stripe and add the events you want to listen to Because by default they're known so you want to listen checkout completed this one as well as the subscription deleted here we go you can add events and at the end point and you should be good to go in the case you want to start charging a subscription before logging users in which I think is a really good way to increase your coners rate you want to make sure that first on your payment link confirmation page you tell people to actually follow the instruction received by email and in your webbook Handler you want to make sure that at the end after creating the user it actually sends an email to the user with a link for them to log in if you already have a business that's processing couple thousands of dollars on monthly recuring revenue and you need some very specific granular control you can try to create customer portals and checkout session using the API but if you're getting started this setup will work for 99% of the cases and actually if you're also getting started I recommend you to play around with onetime payments of their subscriptions the strip setup is exactly the same as I just showed you but you'll see it's much easier to sell a software for $99 lifetime payment than it is to to sell a $19 monthly recording payments and when you're getting started you'll see it's very important you start making a little bit of money at the beginning because you will keep you motivated and one time payments are much easier to sell if you want to understand the logic behind this I'll share a video around here to explain that that's it for this video if you liked it you can like it if you enjoy it you can subscribe to the channel that will really means a lot and until the next one I hope you just ship it

TITLE: 3 lessons from 900 days of coding startups
VIDEO ID: ebcakmRzl0I

================================================================================

after I got fired as a software engineer in November 2021 I started building tiny little websites with one goal in mind become financially independent as I'm recording this video I made $121,000 in the last 30 days with seven website I built 92% of that is profit and I am a solo developer wearing underwear all day long except when I'm making those videos I don't have any employee I don't have any meetings I don't have any deadlines I got lucky in fact exactly one year ago I was making $11,000 per month with all my websites and when I got started I made $ for 5 months I would never believe what's happening today because there is no magic recipe for success but I discovered something when I started the journey 900 days ago I joined Twitter and hang out with other developers chasing the same dream build our own app and Achieve Financial Freedom every day we'll share progress we make on our little website and share our learnings but after a few months not getting really good results most of them stopped showing up daily and gave up but a small group of developers did not give up and keep showing up fast forward to today most of those developers make well over $10,000 per month so here is the thing luck is math if you show up for long enough even though you don't feel like it luck will find you I launched website in the void for 600 days there were tons of opportunities to give up but I kept showing up every single day and I would never earn 120k in the last 30 days if I gave them so here are three ways I manag to say consistent and motivated shipping apps every day for the past 2 and A2 years the first project I work on as an independent developer is called mood to movie it's a very simple app that recommends movies based on your mood it took me just a few days to build the first version of the product because in my head there is some kind of monkey that wants to have instant results so I can easily convince him to work hard for a couple days but it's much harder to get it to work hard on something without getting results for month in fact in 2017 when I started the journey I spent an entire year working on a product that got zero users and I just burned out completely and stop working on any project for another year so now whatever I have an ID in mind I always try to ship the smallest version of that product usually one feature that I can build in a couple days sometimes a week and show it as fast as I can to customers I usually don't like hanging out with people I spend most of my time alone or hanging out with my wife but being isolated is no good and at the same times humans are very social creatures and we can leverage those social interactions to motivate ourselves when I joined Twitter 2 and a half years ago I would follow other developers doing the same thing as me and I remember this guy called dun he was writing crispy tweets and he had around the same number of followers as me and every morning I would try to make a tweet that would have more likes or engagement than him it usually did sorry buddy there is Another Monkey in my brain that wants to play game so I compare myself with other entrepreneurs at the same stage so I can leverage my desire for competition no jealousy just healthy competition because in the end we all win most of my product made at least $1 and so I was really tempted to focus and try to grow each of them and actually people ask me often why do I work on so many project instead of focusing on just one and there is another monkey in my head that have expectations the more time I spend on a specific task the higher the expectations so I could select one project and keep adding features and features and features but that will also grow my expectations and if nothing big happens then I will just simply burn out instead I will launch a tiny website and move on to the next project unless something big happens like it was the case for ship fast one of my products I would rather quit too early and miss an opportunity than quit too late and burnout shipping websites is like a muscle if you on progress you have to practice consist L try looking one hour every day with you and your code editor until it becomes a habit and to avoid losing motivation and stay consistent try what worked for me sh very tiny little projects join some kind of community where there are like-minded people where you can healthily compete against them and quit even if it's too early so you don't burn out in the end entrepreneurs who show up daily will be rewarded I've seen this with my own experience as well as other developers so now it's your time to commit and feel that GitHub contribution board all right if you want to see the 20 plus website I built as an independent developer here's a link to another video and if you enjoy this one consider subscribing to the channel that really means a lot and until the next video I root for you and I hope you just ship it

================================================================================

so I get just earn $1,000 and here is my reward who's the boss I'll never forget my first customers it's a wonderful feeling to make money on the internet with my own little creation so in this video I'm going to show you how I use hiker news to drive well over 25,000 visitors for my software AI tools and habit trackers you'll see there are some patterns you can replicate to get visibility and customers for your own project but there are some very strong codes on hiker news and if you don't want your post to go seen or worst getting banned you want to avoid the three mistakes I will share at the end of the video let's go at the very beginning of the journey when I just got started and had zero experience I launched mood to movie on hicker news and within a few hours the post went viral it got 5,000 visitors at the beginning and I didn't know but it was the spark of something way bigger there are tons of other platforms that feed off hiker news content and when they see top performing post they will usually reshare the content later and so occasionally I would see my app movie being re-shared on other Platforms in Tik Tok news lators and other Tech aggregators and sometimes even in languages I don't understand a few months later I replicated the exact same formula for my habit tracker called habits garden and the post went viral again hitting the front page of haer news and this time the app was monetized so I made a couple $100 and also reach 100 Mr within just a few days and I keep replicating the same formula over and over for the past 2 and a half years and even though not every post will go viral it usually bring good traffic and customers for my own project and I'm going to share exactly what I learned if you don't know what hiker news is it's a tech news aggregator read by developers software Engineers it's run by the community so anyone can post anything and other people vote and choose which post goes up or down and you will see why this is important for us later it was created by y combinator the famous startup incubator so there is a special category for people like you and I to share our own little startups even though we don't aim to build unicorns let me show you the results I got with that the first thing you want to do is to post in the right place in hiker news there are a bunch of category only one matters to us it's the show Hacker News category this is a place where people like you and I where we can share our own little project when you submit your post write show hn column before your title that way your post will automatically be posted in the right category of hiker news first your post will be shown in the/ new subcategory it's a mandatory Place uh every new post has to go through and if it gets a couple of OD votes then he will go to the SL show category I suspect there is a moderator that checks the quality of those post so follow along with the uh things not to do later because this is very important if you want to be promoted if your post is promoted to the slash show category you will get a bunch of traffic couple thousands of traffic as well as a lot of comments and feedback from the community and sometimes if you're very lucky your post will appear in the slash category the main homepage of Hacker News I've never been there but I've seen some other Indie makers reaching that stage and you get crazy traffic all right so the second part to increase your chances to go viral is to be very personal you are not a faceless Corporation trying to make more money you are a cool developer building cool apps in your bedroom or after your 9 to5 and you want to showcase that start your post with something very personal saying things like I made I built or after 6 months coding blah blah blah those usually go pretty well just tell your own story with simple words all right the third part is you want to use The Hacker News language it's a community that's read by developers and Tech enthusiasts so you want to talk to them and for that you want to use Tech words like GPT for SEO or whatever llm is being released at time of the video if you're using generic words like a course coaching or e-commerce it's likely to be ignored unless you turn it into a techy world for instance my habit tracker called habits Garden is just a simple habit trucker but the fact that there are some uh games features like leaderboards and competing with friends I use the word gamified I gamified a habit tracker to fight procrastination and thanks to that the post went viral and get well over 10,000 visitors so you won to make sure to include some kind of techy words in your post the fourth and probably the most important tip is to tell the outcome your post will be competing against dozens of other higher News Post and you have 60 characters to convince someone to click on your post and for that you want to tell exactly what people will get by clicking on it all the product we buil serves a purpose and you want to showcase that part in your title why is it worth my time what's makes it special how is it going to help me if it helps I have a simple formula I use pretty much all the time I start with I made to be personal then I include the product with if possible a tech word like a nextg boiler plate and then I tell the outcome like to ship startups faster or to automate all the boring stuff and finally you want to contribute after you make your own post go in the comment section and write the first comment and explain your story like hey I'm Mark and I realized I was spending lots of money for stripe invoices so I built an alternative show people that you're an actual human behind the post tell them your story tell them what may you create these products and if your PO get up and start to get some traffic you will get some genuine comments from hiker news readers they're usually pretty rough but they're also pretty accurate and they give good feedbacks make sure to reply to comments and ask question because that could be really helpful for you to know which features next to build for your product all right now three mistakes you really want to avoid if you don't want your post to go unseen or even worse getting banned the first one is to avoid emojis don't ask me why Hacker News doesn't like emojis so don't use them the second mistake and probably the most common one I actually made did in my post got B is to ask for up votes unlike other platforms like product tant where you can ask friends and family to support you on hiker news it's against their policies as I said before I believe there is a person that decides which post can be promoted from the show new category to the show category and I'm pretty sure that moderator has access to some more data that we have so for instance if you send your Hacker News Post to friends and family the moderator will see that the traffic is coming directly from that link or that the up votes were made by new Hacker News accounts which looks pretty suspicious instead of asking for super ort spend more time crafting your headline because this is how your post can go viral and finally do not overthink it there is very little you can do to influence the reach of your post so make sure you craft a good headline post it and move on your first post might not be the one that goes viral but if you keep repeating the same strategy over and over you increase your odds of winning there are many ways to get traffic for your startup even if you don't have an audience I'm working on making those videos to help you get customers and if you don't want to miss them out you can subscribe to the channel and there is a link to my blog in the description of this video where I share almost everything I know about marketing you can check that out until the next video I hope you just ship it

TITLE: I made these 23 websites (and earned $562,943)
VIDEO ID: hCMEGQfLIEM

================================================================================

in 2021 I was fired from a software engineer job and I decided to go solo and build my own websites today I have built 23 websites from software habit Strikers and AI tools and I do everything myself from the code the design and the marketing I'm going to show you every website that I made as well as the revenue it has generated you'll see that it's very uneven some never made money some made well over five figures and I'm also going to share three of those website that got acquired the first app I built right after I got fired is called mood to movie it's a movie recommendation based on your mood so if you feel like you're sleepy it's probably going to recommend you some action movies you can scroll through them and if for some reason you don't like the movie you can actually hide it and you will not see it again I never tried to monetize this app but the post went quite viral in total since I launched it it got 100,000 visitors one of the reason is because I posted on ION news I had zero audience back then and I made the post there as a nobody and the post went viral and I got I don't know I think about 10,000 visitors from that post and then it started some kind of like viral Loop where some people on Tik Tok would basically get this information and reshare it on other platforms that's probably why we see some spikes in traffic all around here and also I added a little joke it was not really intended but the horny mood it actually got people speak about this they seem like to enjoy the joke and that created some kind of like Word of Mouth organic word of mouth so pretty fun experience overall after m movie I thought of creating a project that potentially could generate Revenue so I'm a big fan of atomic habits the book and I thought what if we combine habits and games and I had this idea of building a habit tracker where you could stick your habits and it's going to grow a little garden a virtual Garden that you can friends can see so this is the landing page a few video demoing the product and it's priced at $9 per month or $54 per year when the users get access to the product they end up on their like a habit page where you can add any habits you want and then you can tick them and you have this habit grid that's going to fill so you see I've have not been really consistent recently and then you have missions so for instance if you show up every day you can open a box and that box will give you some little rewards so that you can plant flowers later in the game and you have a few achievement you have the streck system to gamify everything here is the little garden so you have different kinds of flowers they different Rarity you unlock them as you progress through the game and you can plant them with the gems you collected from the quests and there's also a social part where you can see what your friends are doing but there's a little Board of who's being the most consistent and you can see here I also managed to get 14,000 users on the app the traffic charts looks like this so I started launching the app on March 2022 there has been a few spikes I'll will share which one of those later and the traffic has been pretty consistent with a few thousand visitors per month to launch the product I went on Hacker News for the second time and I got also really lucky the number of points here show that the app went quite viral and that explained the spike in April 2022 where I get 14,000 visitors and thanks to that I also got the first customers for the first time since a long long time it was about 2 years ago since I haven't done any entrepreneurship projects I was really happy and I was so happy that actually my wife and I open a bottle of champagne I'm going to spare you the The Laughing there you go I spent about a year growing this habit tracker I will show you what the revenue looks like so I launched it about April 2022 and then the revenue was not crazy whatsoever it was about hundred few hundred per month at this point I decided to remove the free plan and the revenue really went up and then I stopped working on the app so obviously the revenue went down later and for the monthly recuring Revenue it went to something like $300 per month in recuring Revenue I also built an app IOS and Android app you can find it actually on the store still so it also had some Revenue coming from the stores I think it's about an extra 50% so probably at the peak it was about $500 Mr and because I stopped working on the app the revenue obviously went down and around this time someone on Twitter reached out to me and offered to buy the product that's why the revenue is actually zero right now because we did transition to its own stripe accounts so I ended up selling the Habit tracker to that person for $10,000 so in total it made almost $6,000 in Revenue plus around $2,000 from the IOS and Android store so that's roughly 17 to $18,000 at this point I'm trying to grow my habit tracker but I am a developer and I love creating stuff too much and so I try to find some clever way to do marketing by creating things and came up with books calculator it's basically a mini app that if you tell it how much you want to read every day at which speed for how long you're going to be able to read these many books and it's going to show you some of the books you can read it's basically a way to visualize your habits over the long run and if you curse and you say oh I want some motivation to read more then he's going to do a little promotion for habits Garden I launched the tool on producton Twitter and everything and I don't remember why there was a spike in traffic at the beginning but it happened and then the traffic has been pretty consistent over time and it's now a little bit growing at this point on Twitter I heard some people talking about programmatic SEO and I am totally new to SEO so I was like oh let's try programmatic SEO for this project see if I can learn something and I realized that for books there's some keywords that are easier to rank and so I created all those pages so if you type here for instance I build programmatically all those pages so I think maybe they're like over 300 Pages ranking on Google probably at the moment as you can see here we have one page another page and so I'm basically trying to rank a bunch of URLs on Google and traffic wise in the search console so Google will not let me show you the data before December but I started as zero like any project and there was nothing for a month and then someday at some point Google started to pick my URLs and started to send some traffic to it and it's not crazy but it's driving few dozens of clicks per day and it doesn't look like it's going to stop so it's not making any money but it's bringing some traffic and it's sending the traffic to The Habit tracker the fourth website I buil is called 50 hacks it's a list of the best productivity hack on the internet so anyone can post a new productivity hack like uh I don't know like no phone in the morning or Airplane Mode whatever this is that his is helping you and then anyone as well without an account can like or dislike those posts I try to mimic what's happening on Reddit so there is a Hot Tab where you would basically see the most recent hacks posted that got the most engagement you have the new one where people basically the most recent post and you have the top ones all time and for each of them you can go click it and you can have a conversation with other users on the platform again without an account I launched it on product T and for the first time ever I got a badge and it ended up being second product of the day so I was so happy and that also helped my Twitter account grow a little bit so I started to have a little audience traffic-wise it got a big burst at the very beginning 45,000 visitor on the month of the launch and in total so far 200,000 visitors that's quite a lot because it went viral a little bit everywhere people would restare this on Twitter Tik Tok and everything and and consistently there will be some new people coming onto the platform and so I decided to monetize it with advertisement so at the bottom of each post there will be an ad placement as well as somewhere yeah you can see here this is an ad for instance for actually one of my products dog fooding my own product and at the bottom there is another Banner here that is an ad as well and if I'm not mistaken to promote to advertise on 50 hacks yeah so this is the pay wall to advertise on 50 hack it's connected directly to my analytics dashboard and is going to show you how much traffic you can expect to get on your site and there is a payment link it didn't make a lot of money but it made $350 which is pretty fun for a project like this one some when in the summer of 2022 I was traveling from Indonesia to France and I set myself a stupid challenge of building an entire app within the plane and I commented on Twitter so that I had something to deliver and I managed to deliver a little something it's called body Crush it's a accountability groups for uh friends this is the landing page here and then when you sign up you can join uh groups with people and you can complete your habits and you can see what they completed so you can either create a new group or you can join an existing group so you have groups for uh I don't know people who wants to tweet every day people to want to become game developers Health Group like workout stretch every day and all those kind of like daily habits and when you complete your habit is going to show some little Comet I launched it on product T and to my surprise he also got a badge third product of the day which is amazing for a very tiny product like this one I guess it's because I got so much love from people on Twitter that they helped and pushed the launch a little bit higher traffic-wise nothing as much as the previous apps about 10,000 visitors in total and the app was free and it's still 100% free so no revenue generated for this one then I also built this little game called decision game the ID is if you have two options like you hesitate between let's say a burger and a pizza then when you press Start you have the overthinking monsters that try to eat Kitty and you have to choose one or the other before the monster actually eats the cat and when you press the cat is happy and your score is saved in the database and you can see there are 25,000 people who won the game and 5,000 who let the overthinking Monster eat the cat traffic-wise it was about 32,000 visitors so I launched around here he got decent traffic and then now it's almost to zero every month one of the reason I buil this game was to promote habits Garden my habit tracker shortly after that I realized I already built a bunch of apps that use games in order to achieve real life goals so I decided to create a gamify list it's a directory of gamification app so whether you're trying to learn math JavaScript Finance building habits any app that will used games will appear in here and so I paid someone on um I think it was upwork to gather some information about games so we have the famous duelingo we have my decision game here we have my habit tracker here and also apps like Strava that use some leaderboards and things like that and each app would get a page so for dualingo for instance people can actually leave reviews you would have some information about the app is it free is it not free where you can use it related apps and you can also search apps by categories let's say carrier you can have apps to I don't know do something like team buildings and all that traffic wise we are at a pretty decent traffic I launched but nothing crazy happened but you I'll show you why it's getting consistent traffic with about 30,000 visitors on the app so far it's because um I didn't know it was random but actually I rank for some keywords like for instance you can see basker here there are some keywords that start to rank for those apps and somehow people find the app valuable so Google keep pushing and giving me some more Impressions every month I Tred to capitalize on the traffic and add a monetization on the app so you can promote your own app it will be featured on some different places on the site it's been a few months now and I managed to get zero customers at the end of the year 2022 I started building an app called visualize habit it's basically an extension of books calculator you can pick any habits say how much you going to do per day how many days per week and it's going to show you some nice visuals on what you can achieve over a year and then you can build your little habits card where you can see all the habits you want to pick and some fun things like I don't know if you read 18 books you read for like 3 days and 19 hours in total for instance so let me show you how that works let's say I'm going to build on my habit gried and I want to code I don't know 30 minutes uh three times a week and I want to walk let's say 10 minutes every day and when you press enter then you're going to see your habits gri I call it this way pretty visual there's a way to share your card so you will download the photo and you can send it to any friends it's a little promotion for my habit tracker habits garden and when you click on this link it's going to open automatically the app habit garden and it's going to import all the habits the person wanted to build so there is a little onboarding flow and you can see you can take your new walk habit and then yeah that's typical of morning flow for habit Garden traffic wise it was probably one of the best launch I've ever made the month I launched so it shows the traffic for January but because I launched it I think by the end of the year so that's probably the New Year resolution time that's also helping a lot it went viral on Reddit and other platforms and it got a golden Kitt award from productons and as well as a producton badge you part of it is because I started to make those videos where I would plug myself into a popular movie or a popular podcast and promote my app in my YouTube channel if you want you'll see a bunch of those videos they do usually do pretty well on Twitter because they're pretty new and people were not expecting to see these from a mini startup fer So that obviously brought a lot of traffic to the app and managed to get a bunch of signups for habits Garden I built another habit tracker style I promise this is the last one it's called heroit where basically you pick a workout Avatar and every day when you work out you're going to grow your little Avatar he got the product tant product of the day which I was really really happy with when you sign up you have your this is your dashboard so those are my avatars let's say I surf this morning you can complete and you get a little bit of XP you can also create new avatars by choosing whatever sports that you like save the frequency and then create your avatar there's also a mobile app for hero fits it's available on the app store and on the Android store same as I did for habits Garden it's called capacitor it's a tech that will basically take all my HTML CSS files and put them into a web view that is going to run on any device and So within a few days I had the app live on the stores I actually built this app Live on YouTube if you find somewhere in my channel some of the first streams I did for I think what seven days yeah spent seven days building the product I did it live while I was actually eating some days I would spend 10 hours on the stream and bunch of people from Twitter would come and debug me help me with the design like Manu I remember is the one who helped me me make those acute Avatar things over was a really fun experience and so when I launched on product hunt I managed to get the product of the Day badge thanks to the community of people who actually help and supported the launch and traffic-wise nothing crazy but still pretty decent and for some reason it's still getting some monthly traffic and of course I tried to add a paid plan to add more avatars but I think I made like probably $30 of Sales Early 2023 everybody was talking about Ai and I wanted to build an app that uses CH GPT and I was totally new to AI so I reached out to my friend called Martin and together we built Naval AI it's a little chatbot on messenger and on Telegram and WhatsApp that's using CH pt4 that was trained on naval's tweet Naval ravikant and then inside of your WhatsApp you can ask question to Naval at least what's looks like a version of Naval it's a fairly simple landing page I also made a little funish video about the product where I was actually talking to naal here I was wondering how do become famous like you being a celebrity is no good uh same it's also available in my YouTube channel if you want to have a look at it we disconnected the app cuz it was a little bit pricey and some people were abusing the system and it's not like it was a business we just did this for fun so I think we made a few hundred I don't have access to a stripe account and traffic-wise we had a decent traffic for a tiny app like this one to stay on the naval Trend I built Naval 25 so I pulled 300 quotes from Naval and put them on a little website and they are organized by the most liked one and people can vote for them if they want where you have random Cotes and you have to choose the one you like the most and you have 25 votes this one is pretty nice and then it's going to increase the counters and update the page every day or every 12 hours it's a very simple app I did just for fun and it didn't get much traffic okay so this is the last app I built that did not make money it's called fake it until you make it it's an app that's available on IOS and Android it's a very simple app you can basically send yourself fake payment notification that look like the stripe notifications you would use it either to prank your friends or to motivate yourself to go back and grind and do the work the link page is pretty simple I made a video in The Wolf of Wall Street and this video actually got a bunch of attention and that's the moment where my Twitter account started to grow back then the app was paid I think I made probably two sales actually it made a little bit of money like probably like something like $30 I made the app free now and instead I'm adding a promotion for another product of mine I'm going to show you later at this point I had built over 10 products and I had a little portfolio website for myself where I would show little cards of the things that I built and I got good feedback from people on Twitter so I decided to make it a product and so I built Indie page it's like link tree for entrepreneurs where you can have your own profile descriptions and show all of your startups there about 5,000 solopreneur registered and the profiles are public so this is for instance the profile of Martin you can see his uh Revenue you can see all of his startups link just like you would do on link tree and you have some other cool features like you have some analytics you can personalize your page you can connect a newsletter and it's priced at $25 for one year access or $45 for an entire lifetime deal this is my Indie page dashboard so you see in my profile I can do anything here I can use markdown to update my B right here I can connect my newsletter like substack or beehive and then I can add any startup I want I can drag and drop and reorganize them hide them add some new startups I can also connect them with stripe so that's what I do for all my startup I add a stripe restricted API key to Indie page and it's going to fetch automatically the revenue from stripe so that the revenue is automatically updated every 12 hours and then I can personalize my page so I can change uh the font I can change the colors for instance I can do literally a bunch of things and I have access to some analytics so I can see the total visitors on my Indie page I can see where the peoples are coming from I can see which links they click and few other things like this and finally people can connect their own domain name so it looks like a really a portfolio website I try to make a kind of like a clone of product tant where startups will be displayed on a discovery page and people can upvote those it got some attention but it did not do anything crazy when I launched on producton back then it ended up being product of the day I was really happy I think it was one of my best launch so far and traffic-wise there has been almost 200,000 visitors that's quite a lot it's also because some people share the Indie page to Their audience so it also brings some extra traffic for instance this is my own Indie page and revenue wise this is an old strap account I disconnected it in January so you would add three, ,000 in Revenue to this so it made a little bit above $1,000 with something ranging from 500 to$ 1,200 every month I wanted to play with AI a little bit more so I created Mech Ling it's a website generator using AI so people would type some text and the AI will create a landing page for that query it would add pictures text and buttons the landing page is fairly simple it shows some customers demo as you can see here two features and the price has changed but when I started it was a onetime payment like something $30 per landing page so let me show you the dashboard uh let me pick one website and there are a bunch of features on each of those websites I'm going to show a demo of each of them so this is the website editor by default is going to generate the website and then the customer can do anything they want so uh you can change the text you can add some new buttons you can change where those buttons will go you can change the font the colors the themes there really are many things you can do here you can also add sections so there are few like headers testimonials ctas pricing really a bunch of things here I basically took all the components I built for my previous website and I try to put them in this site and when someone adds a website it will normally I think if I remember well is going to populate create some uh text using CH GPT and sometimes if it's working it should create an an image with AI the customers can also use let's say with typ PCAT they can also use the unsplash library and add anything they want in here so I'm going to remove that section because it's not supposed to be here and the user can preview the website on mobile laptop whatever so that they know what how the page will look like and when they're ready they can actually deploy the site to their own domain name or they can export the code to HTML and there are also a few analytics like how many visitors on the site same I reuse what I use for my other product in the page same components applied here traffic wise it went pretty well it's a trendy AI product so a bunch of visitors over 10,000 visitors per month and revenue wise I started under a different branding it started as lending AI it made about 7,000 us and then I rebranded to make lending later because lending AI was actually used by a big software company and it made another uh 8.6 th000 so in total it was something around 167,000 and Tech wise I was spending about 10% of the profit for open EI credits so for copy generation with chbt and for the image generation using stable diffusion around November December 2023 I realized I was competing against uh big companies like framer uh Squarespace even WordPress like all those website builder and so it was kind of hard to know how to take the product to the next level and I decided to sell the product so I listed it on acquire and within a few weeks the deal was done and made $35,000 in sale from this startup and so in total for Ming I made a little bit over $50,000 I stayed in the AI world and I created work book PDF it's a little platform where you can generate exercises to learn a new language on the topics that you love so let's say you want to learn French and you love food you can create a workbook with exercises all about food so you would get exercises with word related to food as well as some like a food uh cultural facts and interesting things the Ling page looks like this there is a little demo of the workbook so people know what they are purchasing and the pricing it's a day pass so if you access the product for 30day you will pay $30 I they don't want to go for subscriptions because I'm a big fan of no subscription as a customer I don't like subscriptions so I would like to avoid subscriptions if I can and when you get access to one of those PS you can basically generate any workbooks on the student side this is what you will see you can create a workbook where you would pick the language you actually want to learn you would choose the level you're at and you would pick the topic that you're interested in and once the workbook is generated you will have this little page right here where you have exercises where you have to match words some interesting cultural facts complete the sentence find the right missing words and all these kind of grammar vocabulary things you can also download it as a PDF file so that you can print it and do it without a computer traffic-wise it also went pretty well I launched it on AI directory tools and it's still getting consistent traffic but it's not really making much money it made some money during the launch time and then now it's a few dozen dollars per month at this point I was doing the same thing over and over like set up a landing page send emails to customer to confirm their login listen for for stripe events so I can update the user in the database and all that and I decided to make a little boiler plate for myself so I can reuse it for all my projects and I thought why not making it open so that anyone can use it and so I created chip fast it's a codebase for developers to launch their startups faster this is the Ling page here and we have a little demo of the product which is me with a beard explaining what's going on in the boiler plate it's price uh like this at the moment and we have some testimonials here and one of the biggest thing for the spiler plate is that I was a nobody for years like for six years I was no one literally like doing project that nobody wanted to use and seeing that I received hundreds of messages from people who purchased sh fast and that say that it changed their lives it made me just so so so happy yeah enough of me bragging but the testimonials are one of the most precious thing I got from this B plate so it is a codebase so it's available on GitHub and there's also a little documentation that helps the people to get started set up their landing page shut up stripe and all that kind of things there also a bunch of components as I keep making new apps I add new components to the bo plate so it's more complete traffic wise it is probably the app that got the most traffic I've ever had 4,000 visitors in the last 6 months or so maybe 7 months now most is coming from social media so like Twitter and YouTube and also some word of mouth and financially this is the first trap account I had I disconnected it in early January so that's uh a little bit over $200,000 us Genera since the launch plus another $176,000 and something like probably $8,000 collected from other payments like PayPal so in total she F made $380,000 in Revenue had to turn on the lights it's getting dark here I built by dispute it's a little software that helps prevent disputes or chargeback happening on stripe quick backstory when I was working on hadits Garden the first five payments that were made were made with a fraudulent credit card so someone testing a stolen credit card on my site and the payment went through and I was banned like literally banned from stripe overnight and luckily I had a little audience on Twitter back then and I managed to speak with someone who had a deeper look at my account and reinstated it but I was really really scared so this product by dispute aims at reducing chances that you have fraudulent payments in your account I show some examples of you know like if this happened then do that there is also this little component here so some solo entrepreneurs like myself back then have no clue that you could get in trouble for a few disputes on Stripes so but this is what I try to highlight on this page and then I have a few demo of the product and we have the pricing section here where it's basically a pay per transaction the more transaction you protect the cheaper it gets and on the dashboard size this is what it looks like so this is my I actually use that product for all of my other products so you would add a new stripe account by dispute would listen to events on your stripe accounts and based on the rules you set up it will try to prevent some fraudulent actions so you would add new rules like let's say if a credit card was reported stolen then refund the last payment and then there is a little notification tab where this is the actual data that's happening on my account and you can directly go to your stripe account to check the transactions or sometimes even just refund it or send yourself an email or all this kind of like uh prevention traffic wise it's still pretty decent couple thousand visitors during the launch nice and MoneyWise it made $32,000 when I launched it and then as for other accounts I had to swap my account and it made another 700 50 bucks this year so we are almost at $4,000 in revenue for any new product I launch I created one funish video that I would post on social media so either I would go with Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street or I would play World of Warcraft in real life and those videos really helped me Kickstart the journey it would create an initial boost on all my launch and get the first visitors and people on Twitter love the video so I decided to make a mini course so this is the landing page where I'm basically telling my story exactly how it happened with seen here the first video I made with jogan for the product visualized habits that started to Kink things off and then the story as it is today where most of my product actually end up getting a product on badge and even I got some big names in the game that were reaching out to me that say they love the videos so the landing page would show some features like everything that the course is about little hints most of the fun jokes are made with AI I'm actually not a smart guy and another funny guy as well but the AI chpt is really good at crafting jokes and that is what I use to make those videos and I also use AI to create fake backgrounds and create those like a fake characters in the movie The course looks like this so this is the curriculum on the left and on the right there are all the videos where I basically explain everything that I do how to do step by step from the script to shooting yourself editing the movie and also break down some of the videos that I made traffic wise it's doing pretty decent it's also connected to my Twitter so the traffic is coming from there and financially it made 6.7 th000 last year and this year it made 88.7 th000 so a total of about $15,000 the next website is called logas it's a free tool to generate a little icons so for every website I make I always do the same process I take an SVG and I just change the width and add some colors and this is the logo for all my products and I thought why not making it a product itself and so you would go here choose whatever icon you want and then you can change uh the size of the icon you can change the width of uh the borders change the colors everything there are some presets like this like that rounded whatever you want you can also ask AI to make a logo for you so you can describe your business and it will suggest some icons and matching colors and here on the right side there's a little promotion for my sh fast B plate so that hopefully it's paying back the time I invested for this product I launched it on product tun and it was I think my best launch so far so product of the day product of the week and second product of the month as well as a goldon kitty award for 2023 I was so happy I guess it's uh this video who helped a lot where I'm playing with Matthew M people loved it and obviously that spread the word out and the launch went quite viral at the same time when people download their logo right here is going to save those logos in my database and I created a little directory of logos made with logo fast and if you go here you can see for instance a logo made for uh softwares and you can see some of the logos that were made and if you click on some of them you can actually save it on your local browser or you can download it or you can even edit it and then it's going to open Logo fast and let you edit that SV the purpose of this experiment is to rank some pages on Google I tried earlier this year and Google has already ranked over 2,000 pages so if you search for icons for a SAS for instance you might find one of the icons generated with logo fast it didn't make any money directly but thanks to the promotion for ship fast it generated some sales although I didn't trke any of them when I realized I gave stripe over ,000 just to generate PDF invoices I decided to build my own product so I don't have to pay the stripe fee so I created Z invoice this is the Ling page though the typical when you create invoice with stripe for one time payment you can pay up to $1 per invoice and with invoice it's a onetime payment and you can generate as many invoices as you want the current pricing is this way it's a onetime payment of $49 or 69 for unlimited strap accounts and then the customers going end up on their dashboard where they have a unique link that looks like this that they can send to the customers so that the customers can automatically generate their invoices the users can edit the details they want to show on their invoice so they can change your business name the customer support emails their V8 numbers and all that and on the customer side when they send the link to the customers they'll land on this page where they can retrieve invoices or actually they can retrieve any payments made for the business and when they click here they'll get an email that looks like this and when they click on this link they would end up on this page where they can see all the payments they made for the business and they can download their invoice as well as edit a few information if they made a mistake in the name or if they want to change the vat number for instance and financially wise it made a little bit over $4,000 for the past 2 month of running the product and my most recent product is called poop up it's a little pluging that lets your website show some notifications like the one at the top right I created it after Zenvo because people love the notification I even got the attention of gearmo the CEO of versal which was absolutely amazing so this is how the lending page looks like um we have a little demo of the product with some of the features some use cases and the pricing here so it's price one time payment $9 for one website and $19 for unlimited websites the user dashboards looks like this so people would add their website here and then they could click on it and they can customize anything from when to show the message to when should they hide the message and they can also customize the message itself so they can drag and drop to reorganize uh change the text change the icons as they want and at the bottom there is a little script to add to their website for the pop-ups to show up and when it's going to work is going to look like a little bit like this here you go and revenue wise it made three 32,000 since the launch which was like a little bit over a month ago so pretty nice for a tiny product like this one it took me 3 days to create this product I'll link to another video here if you are curious about the tricks I use to build fast there are two more softwares I would like to show you that I created at the very beginning of the journey when I was learning how to code so the past two years or so I was a solo entrepreneur making all those projects I showed you and then prior to that I was working as a software engineer for a company and prior to that I was learning how to code and I created those softwares and the first one I created is called virally Bots it's the Ling page you can see here it's basically a little messenger Facebook Messenger bot to increase escape room businesses conversions so I would work with escap room business where you would go with your friends to solve Clues and puzzles and I would connect a little messenger bot to their Facebook page so it would look like this their users would type on the buttons on their Facebook Messenger app and the bot will automatically replies with a few games you could have puzzles like solve this puzzle here solve that puzzle and they would get some points and when they get enough points they can get a discount coupon for the escape room business I was working with and so my customers would use these fun messenger games to convince their own customers that they are the best escape rooms in town as I was learning how to code this is basically just a lending page there is no user account if they want to get started they would have to email me and I would have to manually go to their Facebook page to connect a messenger bot and I remember taking a course on UD me where the teacher was explaining how to interact with a Facebook API and I just copy pasted what I had deployed a node.js uh server I think he was Heroku back then and it was working and I was just adding some more messages I literally had no real understanding of what was actually going on and so I spent a little bit over a year on this business it's actually how I made my first internet Dollar online so it generated a little bit over $69,000 us I grow to couple thousand per month uh the Mr actually I think reach 4K in the month of December 2019 escap room businesses would pay $200 per month to access product the messenger bot and I had a couple like maybe 20 customers at the same time then covid killed the entire business and then I burned out and I abandoned the business completely and he keept making a little bit of money over the years until the last customer turn really recently this business helped me understand the foundation of programming and I built another software later that would cover the most important part of web development one of the main struggle I had with viral bot is that customers would have to share their messenger but with their customers in order to get results and because of that not all escap from businesses were getting good results with the product so I decided to create a new one called game widget which is basically a similar thing so it's a game but instead of being on Facebook Messenger it's on a website so the code is old so it's hard to show you but they used to be a little widget here at the bottom left that people can click and actually play a game and so when they would click here it will open a pop-up window in the center and they will be able to play this game right here and so it's like a mini escape room within a website so people can go across different rooms and then they have some puzzles to solve so here they would use the key to open the safe to get the lamp they could turn on the light here using the lamp get some stuff and once they're done solving all the puzzles they will get a discount coupon for the business so they can book I launched this product for a very wide Market I didn't Target Escape rooms but like basically any business so I really struggle to get customers I think I get about $50 in monthly recurring Revenue the pricing is set to pay per use so it's $19 per 500 website visitors which is a little bit price but the commer rates were really good and just like what Co happened and my other software went down I also abandoned this business and didn't touch it the product was making about $50 to $80 per month and so last year I decided to try to sell it and I managed to find a buyer so it was exactly 80 Mr so that's pretty almost nothing and the person bought it for $4.3 th000 which is kind of amazing that was the first startup that got Acquired and I was really happy with that all right that's a wrap if you want to check the text I'm using to build all those products I'll link to a video somewhere right here and if you enjoy the video and would like to subscribe to the channel That would really mean a lot until the next video I hope you just ship it

TITLE: Why your side project makes $0
VIDEO ID: _P28Or4MOUI
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P28Or4MOUI
================================================================================

I built 24 project in the past 2.5 years at the beginning only 25% of my project would make money now in the last year 100% of my site project made money and for that I had to fire the developer in my head to become an entrepreneur now I only launch product that people use love and pay for so that I can work on any project I like from anywhere in the world without having to worry about paying the bills so in this video I'm going to share the five developers mistake I made that kept my site project from making money mistake number one adding a free plan to your product sounds like a good idea but it's killing your Revenue I used to spend about a year on a habit tracker that had a free plan and a Premium plan the reason for the free plan is that I wanted people to try the product to see if it was a good fit and eventually if they like it they would upgrade to the paid plan I spent over a year working on it before I sold it last year around October and I managed to get 140,000 visitors to the website and back then I had zero audience so I was basically working day and night for that out of those 140,000 visitors about 10,000 signed up for habit tracker and at the end of the year I made $6,000 knowing that I spent my entire year working on this that's a really minimal amount of money so here is the red pill only 3% of free users will upgrade to the Premium plan let's take an example let's say you have a free plan and a $10 per month plan that means your average user is worth 30 cents to your business now let's say that you need about $3,000 per month in order to maintain your lifestyle that means you will need 10,000 new users every month or about 75 5,000 monthly visitors I don't know how about you but that sounds like an insane amount of work for a solo entrepreneurs especially if you have a 925 and you have to handle everything for your startup from the legal the customer support and all that so why do we keep seeing free plans everywhere on the Internet is because all those startups are usually VC backed they have a lot of money so that they can spend hundreds and thousands of US dollar into marketing so they collect a bunch of user feedback and they can build the next unicorn but if you're like me you might want to stay solo and you might have a limited marketing budget if any and you cannot afford to spend thousands of US dollar to gather feedbacks so having a free plan is literally slowing you down in your journey to get profitable there are three alternatives to free plans in case you somehow need to show a part of your product to customers before they purchase the first one is offering free credits you basically let your users try your product but for a very limited usage just so that they know what the product is about without getting any benefit from it the second alternative is having a short free trial with a credit card ahead so as for the credit card because you want your users to commit email is on a commitment a credit card is and make sure your free Tri is short 7day maximum in order to people to commit and the third alternative which is my favorite as a developer is to take a standalone feature of your app and make it as a free tool you could see this for instance with ahref tool their keyword research tool is free and if you want to dig more into it you have to purchase their membership this is also what I do with one of my product called logo fast people can generate logos for their startup for free and if they want to build a startup by coding it they would have to purchase ship fast building free tools is amazing especially as a developer because first you fulfill your developer need of creating things the second part is a good way for people to try the product without having to sign up and everything and the third part is good for marketing and building a little audience because you can launch all those little free tools on product time tradit hiker news get some traffic and things will happen you'll learn how to launch and yeah overall I really recommend trying out free tools m number two is the shiny Tech syndrome every week I would see a tweet about the new nodejs killer or a YouTube video about the latest design Trend and the new UI components library to try out and just like as a normal developer I spent a lot of time in the past trying out all those new tools but as I started to make money I had less time to try this tool and spend more time with my users sticking to the same Tech stack and guess what happened I not only ship less bug because I know exactly the tools I'm using I was also way more productive but most importantly users don't care about the invisible users only care about one thing they want a solution to their problems and the shape or the color of the buttons you're using don't matter at all to them if you're a developer and you're looking to make money with your code all those videos and tweets are pure distraction these new tools and libraries are like an endless treadmill every week there will be a new trendy one or a new better one that improves the performances and it never stops and the only way to be productive is to pick one text Tack and stick to it if you don't have a text tack yet I will link somewhere in the video about the text T I'm currently using for all my 24 products mistake number three subscriptions that's a little spicy topic back in May 2023 I built a landing page generator using AI people would pay $39 and so that they can type a prompt my software would generate an entire landing page for them it was working pretty well it was making about100 to $200 per day I think back then it was my most successful product and I decided to change and play around with pricing so I studed to charge a $5 per month subscription instead of a $39 one time payment as soon as I pushed the change live all my sales went down like literally zero for days I revert back to the one time payment thing and things started to pick up again as a developer or a business owner I love subscription it has a sense of passing income and it's helping me predict what's going to happen the next month but as a user you probably notice that we hate subscription there's some kind of headaches going around is because first you have to think about the future what happens if I don't use the product in 2 weeks what happens if I forget to cancel the subscription there is some mental process that's required for people to pay for subscription that doesn't happen when you charge a onetime payment and so roughly selling a $49 onetime payment product is as hard as selling a $9 per month subscription the second drawback of subscriptions is that users turn all the time it's not because someone decid to subscribe today for your software that they will be paying in 6 months from now so unless you have an excellent service your users will anyway way churn as a business owner you probably have onetime payments like a book you pay once and you own it forever is pretty uh pleasurable for a customer and it's helping you getting your first sales online and depending on the product you're making you might have negligible costs of running the service for instance the bandwidth is usually negligible I have half a million page views per month on my app and I'm still on the $20 per month versal plan so even if the user end up costing 1 cents per month you're still Way Beyond profitability for years and if your service EXP Lo and there are a bunch of users coming up you can also grandfather your current users keep them using the product for that onetime payment and start implementing subscription for new users if you have some kind of recording cost let's say you are doing an AI wrapper around the open AI API then you can try the pay-per-use system just like open AI you would make them pay for the usage of your own product this is really fair for users there's no much mental energy spent on their side because if you don't use the product you don't pay that's very simple and I believe this pricing model is going to replace most subscription in a few years I recommend you to start as simple as you can with a one time payment of the pay-per-view system make $1,000 and then think later if you need to implement subscriptions or not mistake number four the H1 tag first impression matters when you meet someone randomly in the street how they behave how they look what they say will influence every decision you'll make about this person it's the same with your website when you're selling a product online your headline is the first impression and this is going to be the most influential part part on whether people will decide to buy or not your product in average a website conversion rate so visitors to customers is about 2% if you're getting started is likely going to be more like 1% even less so for 100 visitors you'll get one user that means that most of the people who visit your website will never see your product but 100% of the people who visit your website will see your headline so make sure you spend enough time crafting a really excellent headline before launching your headline should be short trigger an emotional reaction and answer the question of why would a random stranger on the internet give me 1 minute of their very precious time I wrote a short article about copyrighting for learning Pages you can check in the description the link to my newsletter mistake number five over engineering for my first entrepreneurship project I spent an entire year building a startup I wanted it to be perfect with a bunch of feature user onboarding and a dozens of screens by the end of the year I burn out and I managed to get zero users and made Zer actually that's this little first project right here that you see we've seen earlier that about 1% of your landing page will convert into paying customers so most people will never use your product and to avoid shipping features that people don't need I recommend you to try the 24 hours startup framework if you had to create any startup in 24 hours how it would look like if we talk about Airbnb it could be just a single spreadsheet and if we are remaking Instagram that could be a public Google Drive I'm not saying you should Che a sketchy version of your product but I'm saying that instead of having a big master plan for your startup start with a very tiny version the 24 hours version of your startup as a b line and start building from there in my case I remove a bunch of things from the first version of the product there are three categories the first one is that I remove anything that's invisible to the customer so I do not test my code I do not use git branches I ship directly to production and I do not use typescript and there is a big support button on the website in case if anything goes wrong but that really doesn't open open the second part is that I remove everything that doesn't have Direct Value to the customer so there is no dark mode there is no professional logo there is no reset password form for instance and finally I remove any secondary feature customers come to my website because they have one problem and that problem is usually solved with one feature anything that is not about that feature will be removed from the verse version of my product the goal here is to launch your product fast so you get real user feedback early and you can build the right features for them and make some money I have been building tiny startups in public on Twitter with 100 of other developers and the five mistakes I just shared is usually what sets apart the solo developers who actually end up making money with a site project and those who don't I hope this video is helpful if it is please let me know if you could subscribe to the channel That would means a lot and if you're one of those developer who overthink their side project I'm going to share a link to a video where I shipped a software in 3 days all right that was it for this video and until the next one I hope you just ship it

TITLE: I made $83,212 in March | Solopreneur Diary
VIDEO ID: aGyaL-AyDkQ

================================================================================

[Music] this is going to happen hey it's Mark and welcome back for this video I'm starting this new series where I will make a short video about everything that happens in my life as a solo entrepreneur I go over things that I built like softwares and products I'll over marketing things that I tried that worked and didn't the revenue that I earned and everything else like if I travel or nice books that I read workouts stuff that I learned I'll try to share everything and be as transparent as possible so I will share the good parts but also the parts I struggle with so if you like this Ser please let me know so I do it more oh and also here is my story really quick I got fired 2.5 years ago as a software engineer and I discovered at the community of developers building tiny startups in public on Twitter meaning that solo developers a q Andi who have no ambition to build a unicorn to raise money for VC or even to have any employee just building their tiny little product and I fell in love with the mindsets so I started to build my own project and today 2.5 years later I have grown a little audience of 880,000 people on Twitter where I also met a bunch of friends there this is actually the t-shirt from one of my Twitter friends I also built 21 projects and currently I have 10 stream of income and in average my salary is around $50,000 per month so I'm going to share everything that happens in the month of March let's go all right so now let's talk about work I created a new very tiny software called popup the idea is to increase the website conversion rate by displaying popup notifications it's almost started as a joke the inspiration came from another product of mine called Zenvo one of my friend actually the friend that gave me the T-shirt Dan told me to make it a product and there it was I spent 3 days building it I used AI heavily in order to build a software I'll share a link somewhere here where you can see the video on how I built the product really fast and I launched it without any expectation and 24 hours later it made $1,000 and about 2 weeks later it was at $25,000 in Revenue it's almost pure profit so it was overall pretty nice a very interesting experience and it also gets results for people I've seen a lot of customers coming back to me that says they love the product and it's working well for them so tiny experiments that turn out to be a good thing all right and so far the product that brings the most Revenue to my income is ship fast it's a b plate for developers to ship startups faster and I got a testimonal from a customer who made 2.6 th000 Us in 9 days and this is probably the biggest testimonial like Revenue Wise from a customers that shares the revenue publicly just as a comparison this took me years to reach that point I was stuck at $1,000 per month for so long so big kudos to him I also shipped a new component for the Vol plate called with without it's tiny component that people would typically use under the hero section of their website to show what it is to live without the product they're selling and to live with it it's like basically a before after and this is also really good to improve website conversion rate and I usually get inspiration from all the other products that I make in order to get inspiration for ship fast components so I know what's working and what's not working I also added a new feature for Zenvo my little software for stripe users to generate invoices for their customers without paying the stripe fee now it displays the stripe account name when the email is being sent about two months ago I did a little experiment with AI and SEO so I have a product called logo fast which is a free logo maker it has a little bit of AI in it where if you want a logo for your business you could describe your business ID the AI will reply with the icon that would fit and the colors that would fit and it will suggest you three logos when the user clicks on one of the three suggestions it will save the logo in a database and my server will create an HTML page optimized for Google in order to rank and a few weeks ago Google started to rank all those pages so I have generated now almost 3,000 logos so I have 3,000 pages that are now indexed by Google and I hope that these pages will rank hopefully if it happens it should happen within 3 to 6 months I will definitely report uh the experiments but I think it's pretty fun to see how AI plus a little bit of a human touch could create those valuable HTML pages that could potentially rank on Google I have 21 products and seven are making money and so I sometimes get drowned into data which app should I focus on where should I spend my time and attention and I found a new metric that really helps me to decide which is worth my time it's the kpi is the revenue generated per unique visitor so if a product gets 1,000 unique visitors and generate $1,000 this is a $1 per unique visitor as a matter of comparison my best product ship fast gets 93 cents per visitor and my worst conversion product is by dispute which gets 06 Cent per visitor it's very simplified you know there are opportunities for some mistakes in there but overall I found it really helpful and very clear on where to put my attention on I also did a podcast with Arvid KH he's like the father of solo entrepreneur is a really nice person I will link to the podcast somewhere in here if you want to listen to it we go over the addiction of building apps and all those kind of things filed startups in the past and I would drive my mind crazy I would spend a year building a product that nobody would ever want and finally the probably the biggest highlight of the month work-wise was YouTube I have been making one video per week every week since January this year and my channel was around 5 to 6,000 followers most of the people were probably watching from my audience on Twitter nothing was really happening and suddenly YouTube decided to take one of my video and pop it up and it's crazy in 6 days my channel went from 8,000 followers to 15,000 followers which is absolutely crazy to me my channel was already monetized but it was making $2 to $3 per day which is not crazy and now it's making about 40 to $50 per day which is here in B it's like a living this could pay the bills so this is overall absolutely crazy it's also the first time for me to Outsource a task I do everything solo from product building to marketing to customer support to legal things and I hired someone to make those videos so uh let me know what you think about them all right now a little health update I search every day about 2 hours and 6 months ago I hurt my back I have some back pain in the bottom and one of my friends actually the same friend who the same friend who gave me the t-shirt and who told me to create the poop up startup gave me a pull-up bar and so I do pull-up and chinups every day and also bar hang to flatten my back and this is actually really helpful it has eased the pain to a point where I almost don't feel it anymore and my wife and I are trying a new experiment where we do not eat any food after 5:00 p.m. and go to bed at 10: p.m. and this is working really well we've tried this for the past 10 days and we have a very good restorative slip I also bought a ring the aura ring sleep tracker a couple months ago and I got rid of it it was nice but I felt anxious about getting the perfect sleep score and ironically it would trick me and make me anxious about it and get a worse sleep so I got rid of it and my sleep is better okay now little life update I was reading the book called same as ever by Morgan howel it's it's a book about things that never change in the world it is a really good book for anyone whether you are Developer entrepreneur whatever this is a book that will teach you how the brain works it's a lot of psychology it helps understand how people behave it's very interesting my wife and I also went to Taiwan for 2 weeks we would break our home routine every month or two and go to a different country in Asia we love Taiwan we have a new routine there you're a star you're Hollywood famous so we would wake up around 6:00 a.m. and then we would go straight to a workout after drinking a coffee we always work out together so it's easier to find the motivation to get things done then we would do a little stretch have a healthy breakfast together around 7:30 8:00 a.m. and then we would both go on our computers and work for 4 hours straight where we stay offline so no Twitter no emails just basically most of the time coding or making those videos writing my newsletter but like pure 4 hours of focus then we'll close the computer for the day and we rent a scooter and we would just go around places and wherever this is we're boring tourists we don't do any specific places we want to visit we just get lost with the scooter or by walking and uh this is pretty uh good fit for us we usually finish the day with a 1 hour to 30 minutes walk you got a new friend what and then we come back home take a shower and sometimes watch a movie and go to bed and start the exact same day the day after and in Taiwan we also met a friend from Twitter and I love the fact that now we can find connection Interest online and then meet in real life now let's talk about Revenue I made $83,200 I've been sharing my revenue on Twitter for the past 2.5 years and this is my Revenue in March 2023 back then I made 1,000 us from my product and this month I earned 833 times my salary back then that's absolutely crazy I guess that's why entrepreneurship is so addictive and probably the power of showing up every day now let's break down the revenue for these startups first the most important one that brings the most revenue is ship fast the revenue almost double this month making about $75,000 in the last 30 days this is my Tri dashboard but I also collect payment from other sources like PayPal I guess the revenue double because YouTube picked up my video and decided to put it on the homage so that increase the number of visitors and eventually the revenue and the revenue for my other products like any page or by dispute is pretty steady I barely don't do any marketing for them so I don't expect it to change much I'm happy the way it is because it's solving my own itches and I just like it this way my YouTube channel got monetized back in February this year back then I made $50 and this month It Grow significantly we're sitting now at about $800 for this month and this is pretty nice I would literally pay for my villa here in Valley okay so that was for the money in now let's talk about the money out for business expenses I spend about $4,000 a month for everything plus 3.5% goes to stripe to process payments there is about $300 that goes for the tech stack so my newsletter affiliate program servers database and all that $700 goes to affiliate people who like my product and Market them in exchange of a commission I also spent about $1,000 in ads I'm not very good with ads a friend of mine Nico is helping me with it and usually $11,000 in would bring $2 to $3,000 out and I also spent about $2,000 to Outsource a few tasks like the video editing right now I also lost one income stream it's viral but it's a little software that I created back in 2018 when I started my first solo prer project the wrong way everything was tough back then I stopped I abandoned the product in 2020 and it kept making money until this month where the last customer turned it was a 200 bucks per month subscription so yeah that hurts it's the end of a passive income era and it was a good time and for personal expenses my wife and I rent this place for about $800 per month and we spend I think in total about $2,000 for basic stuff like food we don't like buying physical stuff uh we sometimes go to a good restaurants but we barely don't spend anything I think my most addictive thing is coding apps and luckily that is free all right and just one more thing my YouTube channel recently popped up and if you look at my previous videos it looks like I am doing some kind of overnight success making 50,000 bucks a month I want you to know that it took 2.5 Years starting from zero to get here I have been struggling a lot finding motivation to get things done and sometimes even questioning my entire work thinking that it's absolutely useless and if you actually dig deeper in my story you will see that I have been in the game for about six years not very seriously at the beginning but I've tried a bunch of stuff felt a lot of stuff really a lot of stuff yeah this is not an overnight success but I hope this shows you that if you stick to something and you show up daily then you would get good results all right that was it if you enjoyed the video please subscribe to the channel That would really means a lot all right cheers

================================================================================

in 2017 I spent one year building an app that got zero users two weeks ago I had a random startup ID in mind and it took me only 3 days to build the product using Ai and 24 hours later the launch I made $1,000 Us in profit in this video I'm going to show you the software how I got the startup ID and especially how I use artificial intelligence in order to build really fast let's go all right let me show you real quick what the product is it's called poop up it's the Ling page that you can see here and it basically it's a little script for website that will display popup notifications like those ones customers would typically use it to show that they know the pain of their own customers in order to improve their website conversion rate so this is the landing page that I built right here as you can see we got a couple things going on in here and when customers are ready they can click here they will be prompt to pay and once they've paid they go to their customer dashboard I'm going to show you that right now right there they can add websites let's say we're going to go to that website right here and here is where they customize the pop-ups they want to send they can add messages where each message could have text you could have some icons and everything people can reorganize it and once they're ready they will get a little script at the bottom right here and once it's installed on their own website they can test it and you can see on the right side we going to see those notifications coming up I have built over 20 side projects and one of the most common question that I get is how do you find startup IDs and the answer is simple I do not search for IDs they come to me these product poop up came after I launched Zenvo a little tool for stripe users to to generate invoices without paying the fee I added popup notification on the site to nudge customers into buying and people say we love the notification and poop up came up and prior to Zenvo I was playing around with ship fast a boiler plate for nexs developers and I found out that I paid a lot of money for stripe invoices and I decided to turn those off and I realized I needed to have some kind of product that would let me generate invoices for free and that's how I came up with Zenvo and we can go back in time and the loop keeps going on I build Chast because of another product because of another product and another product so the answer to finding startup IDs is to start somewhere anywhere you can build a note note taking app just make a better version or a version that you would use and you're going to stumble upon real problems in your workflow you're going to learn stuff you can build a tiny audience there will be things happening and those are promising idas for the future I built the product poop up in 3 days and I'm going to share the three ways I actually use in order to build fast and first is that I use a code boiler plate it's called cheap fast it's a boiler plate I made for myself it includes a bunch of learing page comp components so I just have to fill the copy and the landing page is ready it includes also some cool features like user login private dashboard with just a click of a button it handles all the stripe web hook events so I have users updated in my database as soon as they pay and so the actual final part that was missing was to create the script that would sit on my customer's website in order to display those popup notification and this is where AI comes in very handy and I will share everything that I do with GitHub co-pilot in order to build sometimes code that I don't even understand I use GI up cop highight in order to write code two to three times faster it's basically chpt inside of your code editor I can write code fix your code explain your code but you can also do a bunch of other stuff like generate a nice color palette or sometimes even write your copy for the landing page it's absolutely awesome and let me show you how it looks I use copilot absolutely everywhere to write most of my code and I can use it for very simple tasks to very Advanced and integrated tasks let me show you how that works so basically you would write plain English let's say I want to have an array of all the days of the week with all the days of the week you press enter and bingo I press Tab and then is going to create the JavaScript array with all the days of the week which is very handy if I want to do something a bit more advanced I can keep typing English and it knows the entire code of this file and so he going to be able to interact with it let's say now I am on the product when we press test we're going to fire some popup notifications at the top right what we want to do is if the person change to a different page we want to remove those popups and so we need to have some kind of cleanup function and I am familiar with reactjs but JavaScript a little less so I can just tell copilot like if a route change user navigates away call cleanup I press enter and boom I press Tab and GitHub copilot generated this little event listener and we call the cleanup function which is right there that was actually created by copilot and it's going to remove all the pop-ups that we've had it's also really good at generating copy for your websites so not only code but like actually plain English like copyrighting so here on this page I removed this is the headline of the page I remove the text that was right underneath on purpose and if we go to the hero file we are going to see so we have the H1 here and this P tag here is the text that's underneath and bingo you see copilot already has a knowledge of what the product is about thanks to everything that I've uh written previously and it knows that this P tag is underneath the H1 so it should be some kind of like helper sub headline thing and it says oh poop up is a NOCO tool that helps your increase Visitors convers by chowing a poop up to your visitors it's not perfect you can fine tune it there a bunch of way to make the results better but it's really a good start for the copy and you can even use copilot in order to do some very cool stuff like play around with multiple files in your project so in this poop up example I have an API endpoint where I would basically get the script and get the data for the script to show which messages we have to display and I can say something like a functions that fetches the data from the endpoint and return it and here we go you see that we have an entire function um I'm going to come in that we have an entire function right here that is going to hit my API endpoint it's going to pass some parameters and I'm going to get the data back and it's going to sanitize the data and return it and it knows exactly how to write the function for my own code because if I go to that API endpoint so the script in the API part here it knows which parameters are needed the body which part of the body we need the domain and then is going to pass on the right parameters based on what this API endpoint needs and it knows which data will be returned from the response by default GitHub copilot is very awesome but to make it even better you want to use those little tips first you want to provide context to copilot so by default when you type English copilot is going to create some code for you but you want the code to be usable right away so it means it has to hit the right API endpoint it has to have the right variable names in order to upload your new documents to the database right away and the only thing you have to do for that is to keep tabs open as you can see here at the top I have a bunch of tabs open and especially here I'm going to create a react component that lets users proceed to a stripe checkout and on the right side I open this file here which is an API endpoint that basically take on a few parameters create a strap trick out session and return the URL if I did not open this file copilot doesn't have access to it and so when I'm going to create my react component right here it will Generate random API endpoints and you will not name the variables as you do in your code so you want to keep all your files open and when you do this when you start creating your own react component in this case it's going to use all the files it knows from the project in order to create the right components so here we're going to say constant button bu you see as you can see here the price ID here is likely to be what we're going to have somewhere here in the API so it knows it's going to be calling this function so it knows it needs to be pass this variable and if I keep pressing tab enter it's going to Bingo it creates the entire components right here with a loading state with the call to the API it handles it knows when it's loading when it's not it's going to disable if it's not loading handle the click handle event and it's going to call the right API end point with the right parameters right here and this is achieved because it knows this file and this file knows how this file is working this is my database model it knows how users are restores in the database which Fields do they have by default copilot already knows the packages you've installed as you can see here it called those two packages at the top so you don't need to do anything for that another part that very helpful in order to get the most out of copilot is to have your own boiler plates which means a code base that you reuse across different projects where you name variables the same way you have the same way of naming your database schemas and all that so that you already provide the foundation to co-pilot so it knows already how are you going to name this API endpoint how you're going to name a new users uh fields in the database and all that and the final part to leverage GitHub copilot is to use very tiny functions that you can reuse everywhere in your code so in this API route we can see here we have a function that creates the checkout and if you go here we open the stripe.js file which has a few helper function function for stripe such as a function to create a checkout or create a customer portal those are very tiny function that have a specific use case and this is useful because anytime I create a new API routes for instance copilot will be able to reuse those functions in order to do a specific actions and finally in order to ship this app in 3 days I use a bunch of unconventional methods such as not using typescript not using G branches not testing my code I will share somewhere around here a link to that video if you want to dive into it more and so after spending three days on the product it was actually done and I launched it everywhere from producton Twitter hicker news and reddits in total I think there was about 7,000 visitors on the site it made $1,000 within the first 24 hours and I think it's been 4 days now and it should cross $2,000 pretty soon which is pretty good for a tiny product like this one that's it I hope you enjoy the video and you realize the power of AI how a little guy like me can have a junior engineer and a copywriter and maybe even a secretary assistant thanks to AI if you want to dive deeper into how I get couple thousand visitors and the first customers on all my products I'll link to another video somewhere where I go more into details into that if you like the video you can like the video and if you loved it you can subscribe to the channel until then I'll see you for the next video and I hope you just ship it cheers

TITLE: I earn $1,753/day with this SIMPLE tech stack
VIDEO ID: b_ANHgTHNSI

================================================================================

let's talk about Tex Tac I get a lot of suggestion from software Engineers who mention that I could save some money by switching to another text Tac or maybe a new UI components Library that's trendy but I never listen to them and I always stick to the exact same text stack and thanks to that in the last 2 years I was able to ship 21 products and those products are getting 260,000 page views per month and are making over $50,000 in revenue and I'm working solo and I handle the customer support and there is barely any problem and the Tex tack only cost 67 us per month all right now let me show you exactly the tech that I use all right so for the front end part I use reactjs it's a very popular JavaScript library it has a bunch of extra Library like drag and drop features for instance that can plug and play right away and some people say that it's quite complicated I only know 10% of reacts I just use use State and use effects in 99% of the cases it's way enough for all my apps then I pack all that into a nextjs application it's very good for page routing and to have nice page is ranking on Google and it's also super easy to use to style my apps I use tawin CSS I feel like it's much easier than CSS because the style is return return directly on the right HTML tags so it's easy for me to understand what's going on and on top of that I use a UI Library called Daisy UI it has a bunch of components like uh buttons form cards that make things way faster to ship there are a bunch of new design Trends popping up every day which means new UI components libraries coming out and to me that's just distraction customer don't care if I'm using the latest gradient colors or whatever so I stick to that UI Library it's clear it's simple they have 30 or 20 plus themes that I can customize so whenever I ship a new app I would pick a theme and find a cool type face on Google phones and boom I have an entirely design cool looking apps that's up and running all right and for the backend part for my API I would use next year's serverless functions whenever I clone a Nexus project I just add a file in the API folder and I have an entire API endpoint that's up and running I don't need to install packages I don't need to maintain an OS it's just working so well for me and I never had any trouble with overcharge for several less so all good with that for the database I use mongodb I don't know why developers don't like mongodb I love it it's so simple I click a button I open a new database and in minutes I can make queries and I can add anything I want to that database it's just so simple and I absolutely love it I set up a m0 cluster for each new project that I start which is free and just in case things go wrong I do occasional backups cost me about $10 per month and so if something goes wrong I can still use a database backup and restore all the previous data when I'm coding on my computer I use a local version of mongodb that lets me avoid making a network request to the production database when I'm coding so I can code in a train in a plane remote somewhere in the countryside if there is no internet and the the database is here and I can do everything I want and I also don't mess up the production database just in case on top of mongodb I add mongus which simplifies the queries they're more English friendly I would say all right and all my apps use user logins to send things like magic links so that they can sign up with a secure token I would use mun as an email provider for that it's free to get started it's super easy and you can set up a bunch of domains that you want for each of the apps at the moment I'm recording the video I spend three to four us per month in order to send 3 to 4,000 emails which I think is really cheap and finally I use stripe in order to process payments whether it's onetime payments subscriptions credits it works for literally anything stripe API is a little bit daunting when you are getting started there are a bunch of things going on so I will link to an article that I wrote to help you handle stripe subscriptions all right so for the hosting part where my websites are actually leing I use versal for that uh so I push my changes to a GitHub repo and then versal automatically pulls the changes that I made and deploys it to versal instance and I have 21 projects running on versal at the moment it gets over 50,000 visitors a month and I still pay $20 a month so overall pretty good really happy with versal and the Simplicity it's bringing and all my databases are hosted on mongod DB Atlas where I have over 21 clusters and most of them are m0o cluster which are free to monitor data to actually see what's going on in my apps I use a few Services first is plausible it's a simple script analytics that lets me track how many visitors are my my site and sometimes occasionally I will track events like did people click on that button or not it's costing me $29 per month at the moment which is surprisingly the most expensive part of my text te if I receive a customer email support and something goes wrong there's a bug that I don't know where it's coming from I will check the virtual deployment logs it's free to check the last 24 hours and it's usually when I catch the bug and for advanced monitoring things like split testing I would do it manually with the database I would store some kind of like integer in the database randomly and then just make the relevant query in the database see I don't let's say like the last 100 sign up customers filter them by their split test number and see which one purchased which one didn't I don't use any other services for that because I barely track any data and if I need to I would just use the raw mongodb queries and finally some of my products need specific features so for instance I would use AI models for products like logo fast where I help people generate logos or for Workbook PDF to help the help again people will generate workbook to learn a new language I use GPT for under the hood and I spend about $20 per month in open AI credit if I need any other cloud services I would go to Amazon web services the two most common that I use are awss 3 a big bucket where I can host images and this is what I use on Indie page where people upload pictures of their startups or their profile picture this is where the image would go and I also use from time to time AWS think cloud front it say CDN so images or videos load faster for things like a course for instance and a final touch it is not really part of a text tack but I hire a junior software engineer called GitHub co-pilots it cost me $10 per month and it's helping me code way faster I'll link to another video I made about how I turn on a startup ID into the first $1,000 in 4 days using GitHub copilot when I learned how to code I remember struggling finding the perfect text tack but I wish I knew this text tack don't matter customer don't care about the visible what matters is that you pick one text Tack and you stick to it it's like a muscle the more you practice one rep the more comfortable you'll get with it and the faster you'll be able to do it and the faster you ship the faster you'll get customers all right that's the end of the video as always if you like the video you can like the video if you loved it you can subscribe to the Channel please also let me know in the comments if there are any topics you would like me to cover and until the next video just ship it cheers by the way I got someone to help me edit those videos so I can spend more time building apps please let me know what you think about the editing

TITLE: I made $45,250 in February 2024
VIDEO ID: ZzquF3ie-oA

================================================================================

in February 2024 I launched one new startup and added two sources of revenue to my income in total I made $4,250 as a solo entrepreneur with zero employee in this video I'm going to break down everything that I did this month and also why my revenue is down from $57,000 in January 2024 and finally a new routine that I found that helped me produce a better and deeper quality uh work let's get started I spent most of February working on Zenvo my new startup it is a no code tool for stripe users to let their customers generate invoices themselves uh without having to pay for the stripe fee I got this startup ID when I realized uh I gave stripe $1,600 Us in 2023 to generate invoices for my own startups it was a bitter feeling uh the option was turned off by default but I just didn't realize I turn it on after that I decided to turn off the option and then my emails were flooded with customers asking for invoices uh mostly Europeans who need to have well structured invoices with vat and so I had a new startup ID born there was something painful and there was also a financial outcome it would actually save me money uh to build a startup so I built it and I wanted to do something different I built it live on YouTube uh with uh you guys who came and join the streaming it was really fun to connect and also it helped me be more productive so so I would have to show up every day and I cannot just go on Instagram and CH chill when I'm on YouTube so uh overall it was really fun to be doing this um although the entire setup um you know relying on uh Bell internet connection which sometimes drop off uh was a bit stressful but it was overall really fun experience that I'm probably going to do uh one more time this year I spent about 8 Days building that startup Live on YouTube and once it was done I launched it everywhere um I actually shared a video of that launch day uh in the channel in my live videos You'll see the day probably nine is the day we launched it I went on product hunt Twitter hicker news uh Reddit uh I made little videos for that and the product got somewhere around 4,000 visitors within the first 24 hours which also got the first customers to my surprise it got the attention of some people like gear Mo R the COO of versal a billion dooll company I think he enjoyed the little notification popup that I created this is absolutely crazy to me as I am just a little uh internet maker alone in my room and I get the attention of really famous people like this it was just mind-blowing also Peter levels uh of the most prolific Indie makers out there retweeted the launch um and that kind of made my day and added a bunch of visitors as well overall the launch was pretty successful it made $2,000 within the first week of launching and I have some promising signs that uh there is a potential for this startup because customers would email me that saying oh finally a solution for that so it feels like I'm relieving a pain for some people which is a promising ID for the future all right now let's talk about my product bringing the most revenue shiest shiest is a botle plate for programmers to ship startups faster it made $39,000 this month which is down from $49,000 back in January this year it went down maybe because uh it's been 6 month that been running the product it has made almost $300,000 and it might be fair to say that it has reached the the EOS the tech ecosystem and there is some kind of Market saturation going on or uh maybe it's just me uh not spending enough time marketing it uh I'm not so sure about that but at this point it really doesn't matter because um I receive messages from people who are actually shipping startups and making money online thanks to ship Fest and that really fires me up I also added two new components to the boiler plate thanks to the launch of Zenvo uh there is now a new testimonial component as well as a with and without competent my four other startups had a steady Revenue this month bringing about $3,000 um I have no customer support whatsoever so this is some kind of true passive income if I may but this would not be possible if I didn't have an audience of 75,000 people on Twitter talking about Twitter I made $250 in February from the creators earning Revenue nothing crazy but I'm just happy to have this little income income stream and also added 5,000 new followers and if you just join discover my Twitter thank you and finally I added a new uh stream of income to my Revenue it is YouTube I just got U 5,000 subscribers on YouTube uh this is just mind-blowing I think my Twitter following helped a lot and my channel got monetized a few weeks back and I already made almost $50 uh which compared to Twitter Twitter is pretty nice and it's just so fun like it's a New Journey and I'm just so happy to keep going making those videos and this month I started to follow Brian Johnson's blueprint routine in order to improve my health and this was a mistake I bought a uh sleep tracker in order to calculate my sleep score by the end of the night and I realized that the Deeds got me really anxious because I was getting obsessed getting the perfect sleep score which ironically would keep me awake at night and make my sleep score worse so I ditched the ring I got back to my simple routine where I don't work past 6: p.m. my wife and I would go out of the house because that's where we work at night we would stretch play games uh read books whatever uh which is not work and my overall uh sleep would be really good actually in the past 5 years or so I have put sleep as my number one priority without tracking the data it literally changed my life it made me much more motivated to work uh it improved my creativity made me um better at handling Stress and Anxiety this is by far what has impacted my life the most if you can take care of your sleep all right that's it for February for the month of March I expect pretty much all my Revenue to go down because I have a really big project that I want to focus on um I expect it to be about 3 to six month of work which is a little bit daunting uh I'm a little bit stressed about it but I think it is the right thing to do and so I'm going to go uh on holiday and disconnect a little bit from the internet and spend some times on that project um I will also document everything I can on YouTube so if you want to follow along uh you can subscribe to my channel and if you are looking for another video to watch um you can watch a day in my life as a solo entrepreneur living in B I hope you like the video if you liked it you can like it cheers

TITLE: I sold my AI SaaS
VIDEO ID: gJIeexsmtH4
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJIeexsmtH4
================================================================================

in 2023 I built a landing page generator using gp4 and stable diffusion within a few month after launching I made $15,000 in Revenue but for some reason I couldn't grow it so I ended up sending the product for $35,000 in this video I'm going to break down how I got the IDE how I built the first version of the product and got the first customers and how and why I ended up selling it in March 2023 AI is so big and everybody is talking about AI tools chpg and all those AI services that I decide to go all in and build bu my own AI tools as well as a solo developer who's built about 20 websites in the past 2 years I thought it would be really cool if we could just input text and get a learing page or many websites generated for like something like a portfolio a yoga studio um a software learing page and so I start to build and the product was extremely simple um customers would have to fill a form uh describing the tone of the voice they want to be using uh the colors they would like to choose for the landing page uh describe their product describe their customers and choose among one of those three packages so for $19 they would get an entire Ling page generated and they will get more variation more illustrations more images uh with bigger packages here's a demo of a ling page that's been generated with my first version of the product um you can see here it's like a website uh the components are those that I built myself and they are basically empty so you would have this pressing section that I built that was empty and then when the customer would pay I would make a request to the gp4 API to fill in uh information uh by titles and descriptions based on the customer input it will also create um not always really good images uh but that would be relevant to the to the headlines um it would also try to match the colors of uh the websites based on on the image and the customer would be able to update a few things here so if they want to change the theme for instance they can go with whatever they want from the theme and if they're happy with it they can download the code HTML code or just share the code with their team members um it was really minimal the resit were not incredible but it was working and it was pretty impressive to be able to make these with just a few um inputs and so I decided to launch on product tense and the product ended up being uh ranking third of the day which I was really happy with uh back then I was building in public on Twitter so sharing my progress there and I already had um probably 15,000 followers which helped me boost the product hunt launch I also launched on Hacker News uh didn't get much traffic but little push and uh nice comments surprisingly from Hacker News so I was pretty satisfied with it as well within about 2 month the product had made about €7,000 which is roughly $8,000 I was pretty satisfied with it but then I realized the name of my startup was the same as a bigger soft software company so I had to Rebrand the entire website and so I rebranded lending AI into Mech lending I got rid of the AI wordings so that anyone who wants to make a ling page but is not familiar with artificial intelligence would still understand the product uh un likee before it would be simpler no form just people type what they want to make the site I also added this little demo on the landing page that uh was quite I catchy to still show that you can input a text and get a website generated also added some of potential landing page uh that were actually made with the product and I bumped the price a little bit from 29 to from $19 to $29 per landing page the big difference lie in the user dashboard uh unlike before where you would get the lending page generated and not be able to do much with it now users would log in and be able to edit the entire landing page so that includes um changing the headlines changing the images by using either stock photo library um uploading your picture or generating AI photos um adding removing buttons adding sections to the site changing the colors of the site just like before the themes um also the phones as well a bunch of things that could be done here um then people could preview the site and if they are happy with it they would get uh a link so that they will be able to share that with um anyone and start to bring traffic to the landing page and convert into whatever this is they wanted I also added Analytics uh per landing page so that people uh have a little clue of what's going on there the new product was more polished and I decided to launch it so I went back to my Twitter I shared uh this time a little video that explains how it works and I launched it on product tant I did not get the batch this time but I think uh people were used to what I shipped before so these got a bit less attention but I was getting really decent traffic um after the launch people started to reshare this on AI newsletter and it it got 10 to 15K visitors uh per month and I think within 3 months I had made almost 9,000 Us doll uh which was quite nice I'm living here in Bali and it would definitely pay more than the bills um although there were a little less conversions in terms of visitor to uh paid customers and I think it's because I entered the market of big landing page Builders so framer word WordPress um webflow would compete with I would compete with those uh big guys and as a solo prer with limited resources um it was really hard to commit users to pay for my uh entire website generator when they have framer as a competitor and from that moment I knew it was time to sell because I had no idea how to get it to the next level in October 2023 when I decided to sell the startup I abandoned it which means I would still do customer support but I would not add any feature or I would not do any marketing meanwhile I listed the startup on aire.com which is a uh small startup acquisition marketplace where you have a bunch of uh buyers that are willing to have a look at your product after listing the startup I got dozens of offer within one day I think and uh some of them were promising so I started to engage engage with the buyers and the process is always similar at least for micro startup like mine where you would have to sign um an agreements on which assets will be transferred um in my case it would be a domain name the code base the customer base the datab and all that and uh after a few days chatting with a buyer one of them decided to buy the startup and without even having any phone call the money lending in my bank account we agreed on $35,000 and after the cut I got 33.6k in my bank account which uh seems like crazy knowing that we never uh got each other on the phone um this is actually my third startup acquisition this year I sold two other mro startup and I wrote a little blog article about it if you want I'll leave a link in the description if that helps you um this is not a lifechanging amount of money but 35k plus 15K Revenue that's $50,000 which where I live here in valy would basically buy me two years of whatever this is I want to do so I would get two years of peacefulness retirement or two years of grinds if I want and this is exactly what I did after selling the startup I keep shipping more apps and now my small like really tiny internet businesses are making this month January 2024 50 $50,000 Us in Revenue zero employee and 90% profit and I couldn't have done it without having the clarity and the peace of mind that uh those uh startup sell gave me last year so I really recommend you to um shop daily find a product a problem that you have that you want to solve ship a very small tiny version of the the product and launch it and see where that goes cuz you might U end up getting some sales and up be able to to sell it and buy a few uh years of retirement or Grant cheers

================================================================================

in 2018 I made a call from Japan to a business in the United States and I sold them a software that I did not create that's how I made my first internet dollar and that's how I built a software business that lasted for 5 years and made almost six figures in revenue and is still paying the bills today even though I abandoned it for years ago hey I'm Mark I am a son entrepreneur and I built small internet businesses that are now making $50,000 a month in Revenue at 90% profit with zero employee in this video I'm going to break down how I created my software without knowing how to code how I grew it and what's going on to in 2018 I moved to s South Korea I was there because an high school friend of mine was already there and managed to get $11,000 uh an investment from Angel Investors and he offered me to become the co-founder we created an AI startup and we hired two employees in the little office in the middle of s and we were trying to predict the the price of flight tickets uh we felt miserably we couldn't deliver anything valuable um but it was a very interesting experience because I learned something about me which is I want to to be 100% free I don't want employee I don't want investors I want to work on my own little project and so after we moved on I had zero income uh and no savings so I started to do some side gigs where I would go in movies uh as a actor in the background uh they would pay $200 uh a day for like 12 to 14 hours of acting I wouldn't do much uh I would just get some makeup and and get paid at the end of the day I would have one gig a week which would pay just enough for me to be able to leave and eat in s South Korea I started to brainstorm on Startup ID uh that I could work of on just by myself so I would go to this little uh co-working space in the basement near my house they would provide free coffee and free snacks which was really good at the time uh back then in 2018 uh messenger uh and WhatsApp Bots were very popular so basically it's uh automated replies from a business that can chat with a customer to help them uh I've been a gamer my entire life uh so I thought why not having some kind of game on messenger or Whatsapp that could entertain potential customers give them a discount coupon if they succeed at the game so that the business could grow and so I came up with this IDE of a messenger bot that would actually be an entire escape room so you would have a lot of puzzles and riddles uh that you could you can play and if you finish the game you get a discount coupon um back then it was just an IDE but now I have to show you the software uh so you have um a better understanding of what I had in mind so this is a customer of mine on the left side uh they would sign up on my website and then they will connect their Facebook page people will be able to play uh those games once the Facebook page is connected on messenger so the B here is automated it offers some rles and puzzles that people can click um if I want to play this game for instance the there you go you would have uh the the automated replies from the messenger Bots that will challenge you you earn some points and at the end if you get enough points you get a discount coupon for the skap room business uh I was a terrible programmer back then and I know we would would take sometimes to build something like this but luckily in my co-working space I made this guy on the right Andre which is a very um successful marketer and later became my friend and he told me then why don't you just build it before why don't you just sell it before you build it and uh I had nothing else much at the time uh it was very reliable so I was like oh why not let's give it a try so I started uh to send C emails to escape room businesses uh would say something like this I can help you get more traction or get more customers usually my code emails would be three lines um I would always add the name of the business owner at the top and try to explain a little bit how how this thing work um I sent those emails and I had to go to Japan for a Visa Run I had no money so I ended up in the cheapest and the tiniest uh room in OA Japan uh but I started to get some replies from those businesses and uh one of them wanted to get on the phone call with me and I uh did the call and this changed my entire life uh so I was in this room I was tired and uh the C was K for somewhere in the afternoon the Wi-Fi was bad so I had to go down in the living room it was really hot it was noisy there were people um I was I I was a terrible marketer and a terrible salesperson uh but I jump on the call and the call lasted for 42 minutes of cringiness and awkwardness and eventually at the end she said uh yes I'm in and uh she wanted to move on and get that uh messenger butt set up for her page and she asked for the payment page uh I sent her the link and she paid and eventually she turned uh just only recently 2023 after spending almost $5,000 on this messenger bot so that call entirely changed my life because it was my first dollar online and without knowing it after this first Fone call I made $5,000 I went back to Korea more motivated than ever I had paying customers and I had a product to build but I was a very bad programmer so I started to like find uh pieces of codes on YouTube and GitHub and try to assemble some product I would bring my computer everywhere um even when I would do some gigs and I would build in the bus eventually I ended up building a product that was working and I also made this little website with some U social proof and everything but I had no idea how to authenticate users like how to create a proper account so people would click here they would end up on a stright payment page they could pay and then they would have to fill a form that asked for their Facebook page and their email for contacting and I would manually have to set them up instead of logging them through Facebook and do it automatically um I started to get few more customers and because we had no reason to stay in South Korea we moved to Bal with my current girlfriend who later is now my wife um my days were would be really chill I would spend most of my time building I had a very um specific time schedule so I would surf in the morning and then I would come back and do marketing so I would do cold emails like I did in the past C worked and a little bit of Facebook ads I would also um try to take care of my health by doing some stretching and uh reading books and on the afternoon I would work on the product 90% of my customers would come from code emails and as a product guy I have no idea how to send good code emails so I follow this guy Alex who write about sending code emails that sell and I would take his templates personalize them for the industry I was in so ESC room businesses and I would add some variables like the business owner name and the business name uh then it was matter of getting uh leads and leads contact so I would go on trip advisor and type Escape rooms in CT and I would end up on their website and usually on their website of the business somewhere in here you would find the contact if you scroll you would get the email of the business a way to improve the conversion rate it's important to add the name of the person so the manager or the fer uh to make sure that it's personalized for that I would go back to Trip Advisor I would scroll through the review section and usually a member of the team or sometimes the funer would reply to comments of customers and add their name and sometimes even their business email I would just get that name here and I I would add all the information I collected to a sales pipeline it's basically a four stage pipeline um where I would per put the new contacts in here send them one C email if they don't rep I'll will send them another one 3 days later and on and on and on until I send four emails if some of the reply I would try to engage with them and get them on a zoom call uh back then in 20188 Zoom was not popular so it was quite hard but once they were on Zoom I knew that 60 to 70% chance they would subscribe for my services I would call col 10 new leads per day and I would send also 10 emails per day and in average I would get one to two reply and I would get one to two calls per week I would charge 199 per month for these messenger Bots but I was also experience some turn uh so I would I would get some customers and and some other customers would turn which would at the beginning uh make my Revenue around $1,000 to $1,500 per month so I started to experience with yearly membership I would say I would sell the bot for a discount for a yearly price at $2,000 and to my surprise some people actually paid I would get a sales notification from strip that says I received a $2,000 uh payment which was massive for me especially living in Bell where I would live with about less than $11,000 a month um the business the mini business started to grow a little bit I would have 10 to 15 customers at the time across uh the US the Europe and Australia and the business look uh like this uh C it was about $1,000 in 200 19 and I would keep growing growing uh I started to implement annual annual payments here and eventually it ended up reaching $6,000 in monthly uh revenue and then covid happened in February 2021 because of covid escape from businesses had to close their locations and I had two options either I was too greedy and I keept charging them uh the monthly recurring Revenue until they tell me hey stop or I just gave them service for free until someday they will be able to reopen which is what I did so they will I emailed the entire list of customers that I had and I uh told them like he I'm not going to collect any payments until things get better so obviously the revenue went to zero for 4 months as you can see here there's absolutely nothing um I was in Bal back then which uh I was pretty lucky because Co was not really bad and I could Surf and for some reason I felt disconnected from the business so I started a YouTube channel about surf just to keep me busy for a couple month trying to decide whether I'm going to keep working on this business later or not in August 2020 things started to reopen a bit so escape room businesses could open their doors and make some money u a lot of them had closed because of like they went bankrupt or they just you know business owners wanted to do something different uh so you can see here things started again not as crazy as they used to be uh but I didn't do any marketing and it was still paying customers from the previous year 2019 uh I would make 1.3 1.5k per month which is uh pretty good for here in Bal regarding the fact that I was not doing any marketing around this time with my wife we went back to France and we got married we eventually got stuck there and couldn't come back to Bal for about a year um things also went a little bit wrong in my life I got uh I think depressed and uh not in the right shoes so I decided to abandon the business completely uh of course customers would keep their uh service I had nothing to do to provide the service anyway cuz it was like an API I was just not doing any new marketing and andb boing new customers and eventually it's been four years since I haven't touched anything and you can see here the revenue is slowly shrinking and it will at some point to reach zero per month probably in 2024 and now recently one of my biggest customer turns bring the revenue down to $200 a month this year uh this was Alex uh they had two locations and this spend almost 13,000 us on uh my software which uh seems like crazy to me when I think I just got started with a couple of cold emails this is not a typical Silicon Valley unicorn fer this is just a random guy trying to make a living with its app in his bedroom this story led me to where I am today where I have all the freedom in the world where I can surf spend time with my family spend time with my wife and take care of my health anytime while also making $50,000 a month so whatever this is you have in mind just get started because you might be one C email away from closing a $5,000 client
