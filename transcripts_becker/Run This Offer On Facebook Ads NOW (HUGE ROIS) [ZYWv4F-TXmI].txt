================================================================================

okay in this video i'm going to show you the best offer for facebook and youtube ads by far okay by using this offer strategy i've generated over 20 million dollars in sales on one campaign for one business and i've scaled high risk to being the fastest growing ad analytics company entire world it works period if you build offers like this you're going to make a lot more money from your ads because this is the biggest hack when it comes to running facebook and youtube ads if you understand how to structure an offers in this way you're gonna kill it every single person i know it's made 10 20 30 million dollars worth of sales plus via ads they're doing this every other person i know that's getting mediocre results constantly and can't escape out of this and is trying to do all sorts of complex stuff they don't do this okay until you do this you're going to keep wasting money it's going to be a struggle and it's going to be terrible because i had the same exact experience before i started applying this real quick if you're new here i'm alex becker i'm ceo of hiros again we're the fastest growing ad analytics cup in the world this gives me a little bit of insight in what's working with ads i also run the most successful ad mastermind online based on results i have more six seven eight-figure results than anybody else ever with ad masterminds it's really cool and i'm not saying that so you can join it i'm just saying i need i kind of know what's going to be working with facebook and youtube ads and so in this video i'm just going to show you exactly the type of offers that work and if you understand how to make an offer like this oh it's going to be juicy it's going to be fun you're going to you're going to you're going to have a lot of juice you can have juice parties everyone be like where'd you get all that juice and you'd be like from this alex becker video which has the content i'm gonna show you right now and i'm gonna stop rambling let's get into it alright guys so let's talk about this because this is actually in my opinion and i know i always say this but this is the number one secret to running really successful ads so the problem that i see with almost every ad campaign that won't scale or once it just won't work at all you might have always been just confused why does my offer not work with ads why can't i get this on ads why does it never work with ads it's because the offer is not made to work with ads you know we got to really think what type of offer is going to work with ads not all offers work with ads for example something i constantly see businesses fail at is they make a low ticket software for example when i made market hero okay this thing ranged from nineteen dollars to let's just say a thousand dollars per month with the vast majority of users being in the forty nine dollar uh to one hundred dollar range and also had a 14 day free trial all right this offer right here absolutely sucked with ads why well first off email marketing very saturated there's already tons of other things in the market but on top of that it was very hard to ever make a profit upfront selling it like this in fact it was impossible one people just go to the front of the site and try to free trial uh or they take it through there and even when we work out the free trial numbers it was very hard to make our money back unless we were willing to wait three months for all the rebills to come in which is actually a great setup if we're looking at ltv profit but when i'm running ads i want to make profit up front because the more profit you make up front the farther you can scale look if you're making if you're spending a thousand dollars and make five thousand dollars you can scale so far to the point that you're spending five thousand dollars to make five thousand dollars and you're just getting all the customers in and let's just look at it this way all right so let's imagine so let's imagine it like this okay so let's imagine this is the amount of leads per day that we get with 5 000 leads per day being down here 1 000 up here okay and let's look at our roi at you know a 5x right here all right so 5 000 back a day for a thousand dollars spent and a 0x right here right we're able to actually go and fuel our business this way because we have so much profit margin to wiggle our scale into so we could scale maybe 5 10 15 times farther and get way more customers into our business which we can then make money on the back end from which is where everybody should make money anyways okay and so this offer here doesn't work and i've seen people try it with like a 47 offer i've seen people try 99 offers i just see them try and sell their supplements i see them try and sell books and then what eventually happens is they have to take these offers that don't work and put something in front of them like a book funnel or something like that they have to go and put weird stuff in front of it or a trip wire and they end up having to do all these things in order to sell this offer that they would rather just that's their core offer okay so when you're thinking about your business maybe you have an offer that just won't work with ads it's just been extremely difficult to work with ads what you don't want to do is take an offer that's not designed to work for ads and run ads to it what you want to do is you want to let's say this is your core offer you want to put something in front of it that's designed for ads or you want to design your product from the get go to work with ads so for example iros is uh it's 347 a month on the lowest level okay easily gets people 10x roi you guys should check out hiros because if you're running ads without hirose you're actually functionally insane it pays for itself 10 times over we guarantee that result with tracking and correct attribution people can scale much further they save a ton of money it's just a known fact at this point this is where we have literally every influencer big info marketer large e-commerce brands sas companies this is why it's the fastest eye tracking company growth wise in the world right now okay it just works you should you should use it enough about that though but there's a reason why i only allow us to sell it at 3 500 up front you have to buy one year up front why why is this why do we require a phone call for this why don't i just sell it for the free trial why don't i sell uh 29 packages 99 packages well there's a reason because we like to provide super stellar support okay and we can't provide super stellar one to one support at these prices right here but another secondary reason right here uh that i don't allow three forty seven dollar signups is because this works exceptionally well with ads okay look the number one funnel for ads by far are call funnels to high ticket products by far why the conversion rates on a five thousand ten thousand dollar product especially when you work in a phone funnel work out to just generate a far better roi i've talked about this every single time i talk about ads in these videos if you have a thousand people in let's say you're paying ten dollars per lead and you're selling a 50 product and you have a 10 conversion rate so you sell 100 of these and 10 is insane i've never seen anybody achieve that ever we're gonna make five thousand dollars back okay we're gonna lose money on this thing if we get a thousand leads in and we have a eight thousand dollar product and we get a point zero two conversion rate okay our point two percent look my math is going to be terrible but a point 0.2 conversion rate right here yeah 0.2 math is correct right there we're going to make sixteen thousand dollars and six thousand dollars profit and this is much easier to achieve than this okay especially when you have a cough line right there so when you're thinking to yourself all right how am i going to get leads in my business because what we talked about last videos one of the most profitable things you can do is use your ads as legion free legion and the way you do that is if you cover ad costs if you eliminate this let's say we're getting uh we can get 3 000 leads in a day uh and we spend 10 000 okay that that stinks for 3 000 leads we're down 10 000 per day but if we make 10 000 back it becomes a free three thousand dollar leads which we can then sell on our backlink back end for all infinity and make tons of money now if we can make money let's say we make 5k profit on that uh 10k let's say we make 15k back every day that's even sweeter because then we're making money on the front end and the back end but this is very hard to do unless that product is designed for ads okay so we have to think about what type of product is best for ads i'll tell you what i would look for it has to be high ticket the higher ticket the better if i can sell something for 10 15 000 that's what i'm gonna do that's the service i'm gonna design that's what i'm gonna use to get leads in for example let's say our main product was like workout courses or something like that like we're selling 99 150 uh workout courses and supplements what i would do is i would make a 10 000 super offer like an event or something like that on the front end and i would use that as my thing is everybody who comes in from this going to buy the ten thousand dollar thing no but if point two percent of them do the other 99.8 percent can then become customers of our main product that's that's the goose right there okay so the first thing you want to do is you want to make it as high ticket as possible even if you have to make another product to be super high tickets you could sell your most high ticket level form of coaching on your front end use that that will cover ad cost then you can sell all your smaller things to people that don't buy the highest ticket thing also sell it on the phone if you can buy a call funnel or if you can make a call funnel work this is what gets you the best rois so what can be super high ticket what can be sold on the phone next what is missing in the marketplace this is one of the best things you need to look at so many people go out there and they sought at one prog let's say sam evans consulting course okay well about 50 200 consulting courses later if you go through youtube there's about 200 of these damn things you're going to be running ads against so many people that the cost acquire customer is so expensive just due the choices the customer has okay if the original pie of this marketplace right here was 100 million dollars and you could originally get a customer for let's say you could get a lead in for one dollar well the more people that start bidding on this the lower the profits get so let's imagine if we have 200 courses right here each course can only make two million bucks maybe some of them stand up and make five times more another but again it's it's extremely difficult when you're not the only person going for this thing and the cost per lead is going to skyrocket because all these people that have courses are going to start paying more and more so what happens is the cost per lead goes up and the total profit you can make is down so what can you do against these niches instead let's say you're in the consulting niche figure out a service that is high ticket you can sell on the phone to consulting businesses that nobody else is selling maybe it's optimizing their social media maybe it's optimizing their email campaigns maybe it's optimizing their youtube ads maybe it's going and getting them published on forbes or something like that find the service that much fewer people are selling that appeals to your target market so if you're selling the consultants and you got a 2 000 course or something like that or a membership or high ticket coaching or whatever think hmm how can i use a front-end maybe done for you service it's super expensive for consultants people will come in here to learn about it or get information on it or whatnot and then i can get them into here this is how you would go out there and really crush it with ads see what you need to understand is that when you're making ads it's like you're getting in a dog fight now look there's all sorts of roles for all sorts of dogs a chihuahua a poodle you know it's great for sitting on a paris hilton's lap doesn't mean the dog can't make money it doesn't mean the dog can't be a successful business but when you're going into an ad arena you're going against other people so you need to have a pitbull all right you need to genetically breed an offer to be a pitbull you need to make an offer specifically for ads first don't make the offer and then make the ads make the think about the ads and design the offer around the ads and then use the pitbull offer to get people in get leads in and then you can sell them poodles okay you can sell them poodles at a massive profit margin and then you're not paying a massive cost to get them in there that is how you kill it that is how i have grown high rose that is how i grew my last company market hero for example what we did is i said okay cool this offer this 49 per month offer absolutely tanking it not working at all i'm losing so much money up front it's not going to work well what i did instead is i made a 2 offer that i sold through a webinar okay and then i got people in to this webinar we made like a a 0.5 to sometimes 4x roi on the webinar when all payment plans and everything were coming in long story short it would to get leads in and then let's say i got 50 000 leads a month okay cool i can get a thousand of these people to sign up for my software that's ten thousand but you get it i get a thousand these people to sign up for my software bam my recurring revenue is increasing by 50k a month and this is where the real money starts coming because once i get this let's say we increase this this revenue this recurring revenue the 300k per month okay i'm just making this passively on top of it increasing and it's all fueled by this thing right here so i have a very successful business right here because if i just sold this thing right here this money wouldn't be made i'm able to make a little bit of money right here by selling the high ticket offer that's genetically bred for ads and i'm able to get leads in for free and so there i have a nice 350 k per month business this isn't our revenue and the numbers we were doing we actually did way more on this offer and what we're doing right here i'm just giving you right here i have a nice 350k per month business without ever having to lose money on ads that's how you make offers for ads that's what kills it on facebook so depending on what you're doing let's say you have supplements find a high ticket offer maybe a done-for-you camp a huge bundle of your your supplements together with an info marketing course find something you can sell for a thousand and two thousand dollars up front say you're selling courses find some ten thousand five thousand dollar done for you service you can sell up front that attracts the target customer okay say you're selling a sass find a way when you're designing your sas in the first place the best thing to do is find a way to make a high-ticket sas where you can sell enterprise maybe a 25 000 per month package or something like that that's where it's going to become so easy to run ads at because you can spend five thousand dollars just to get one customer you know you could spend 25 000 to get one customer and it's 12x profitable in a year that's that's where the juice is at say you're making a software or something like that so that being said guys that's the lesson for the day if you do this this is makes this is made this has been my secret to running ads this has been every successful business i know that has had a lot of success running ads without much effort they sell something they sell something matches the criteria they use the strategy i talked about selling low ticket things selling things that are not optimal for ads makes your life hard selling low ticket reoccurring things you lose money up front you have to wait six months you sell these complicated funnels they fall apart you have like these tripwire seven dollar ten dollar fifteen dollar thing it just becomes a real mess and it's hard to manage and you should check out the video from uh earlier this week where i talk about the perfect funnels for these things but if you can just make a big simple offer which the simplest way to make an offer and sell a high ticket is a call funnel that's the juice you're in so that being said guys one thing i would
