================================================================================

so this guide isn't just the advanced guiding conversions this is actually a five-step system that i've used over and over and over again across youtube ads across facebook ads across every person i've helped scale their business with ads i apply this five-step hack i know that sounds markety i know that sounds gimmicky just bear with me but it is literally a checklist of factors that i look at in every single ad every single landing page every single sales message and by applying this i've been able to make tens of millions of dollars from ads off of much less than that in ad spend the reason for that is because it focuses on the number one most important thing that adds working people doing what you want them to do if you apply these five things this is actually ten but this is five if you apply these five things to your ads and to everything you're doing you are going to consistently get people to do a lot more of what you want them to do click buy do a handstand you could probably get someone to do a handstand with this or maybe even go out on a date with you just kidding you add buyers you guys are gross all right you got to stick to making money because that's all i got i'm just kidding so that being said let's just dive in this because if you apply to your ads you're going to see huge gains in every area whenever i'm helping people in my iron mastermind group go and grow their ads by the way you can check that out below after this video is done literally what i'm doing 90 of time is running this checklist on everything they're doing if they follow this checklist they usually do really well if they don't they don't do very well so take this checklist and use it i'm not even going to make you pay for it let's look at it so guys what you're looking at right here is a page that has done an obscene amount of money [Music] now i'm not saying that to my horn or anything but iris is a pretty successful company and where all the sales came from is this page but more so where all the sales came from from our advertising and how they converted is the understanding that this page represents now i could show you our sales pages i could show you our sales calls scripts heck i'll even talk about that in the channel in the future if you guys want to get into that but what you need to understand is why these pages convert and really what makes people do anything when it comes to presenting a product online so i've actually breaking it down in five steps that you can actually go below this video and look at but whenever you're making any sales page and you're running it on facebook you're running on youtube the number one thing with your ads is that what you're offering that they're going to gain from the ad is expressed in this way whether it's your sales page or more importantly your opt-ins are the starts of your funnel if you're going to look at any any any good sales page that has worked on facebook or youtube you're going to look at any good opt-in they all have this and i want to show you to show you this on this page because it's just so simple because the page is so simple so the first thing you want to make sure that every single thing you send traffic to has is it presents a desired result a clear desired result more importantly that is important to the target demographic most times when i say people sending people to an opt-in page it's not really offering a clear result okay so how we get sales 52 cheaper from that is the clear result right there reduced cost 32 percent increased ad conversion by 22 percent allowed us to acquire customers 52 cheaper using high-risk tracking okay which again is true if you're not on hi-ros especially after the ios update i don't know what you're doing it's it's costing you so much money to run ads way more than it should okay that's hundreds of thousands of dollars a year just being lit on fire if you have even a decently sized company but more importantly you can see how clear the result is on this page if you look at your uh your ad or your opt-in and people are able to hit the page and there's not something that clearly states what result they're going to get it's not going to do well next needs to be in a suggested fast time frame now does this mean you should promise that people are going to get rich quick or something like that on your page well i mean if you do if you are selling make money online marketing or you're selling some gimmicky stuff like that which i'm not hating on you but if you do sell if you sell something gimmicky that offers people results way too quickly you know who you are and you know why you do that because it works now look there's many ways to do this without saying hey you're going to make a billion dollars in 30 so you can see what i actually do right here using a copy and paste tracking script the reason why i say this right here is because when people think about copy and paste they think about hey it's easy and it's quick and easy to do that's why when people say hey get this refrigerator and you'll be cooling your food and the time it takes you to plug it in okay if you look at any good offer it talks about how fast and easy the person can get the result now the thing is like for example with hi-ros and many other products people can get the result quickly if you send people i don't know organ meats okay they're going to be eating healthy meats quickly instantly just as soon as they can put it in their microwave so what you want to find some way to do in any type of marketing that you're doing is find some way to connect the result to it being fast and easy because people want the washing machine let me explain what that means in any type of any business model people don't want to learn how to manually wash their dishes they want something they can plug in and get the result right away we usually think people are lazy and they don't want to do all the extra steps and that's 100 true if i told you you had to actually learn about how a cooling unit works in order to cool your house with an ac unit a lot less people would buy ac units all people want is something that they can plug in and instantly cools their home in every aspect their life they want it to be that push button simple you need to find a way to express that okay the person can get a result quickly and easily you're going to have their interest but there's so much more to now in order to really get people to react what you need to make people feel is fomo this is very hard to do in marketing but if you can do it you're going to be working with pretty much the best sales tactic while marketing it's it's enough to get entire nations to invest their money in gamestop it's fomo it's the most powerful thing in the entire world in theory and marketing i'm sure there might be some more powerful marketing tactics that being said you want to find some way to express that the result is being had with something that's a new opportunity that there that they should know about that they've missed out on a new opportunity that they should know about but they've missed out on that is the most powerful thing to get people to react ever so for example in my niche i know that people that run ads they're very well aware that ai controls the optimization of ads and so hiro says a lot of things it tracks people's ads so that they can easily go and get a better roi by making decisions but also feeds the data back into the ai of the ad platform so the targeting gets better i focus on that second part more than the first part because that gets people excited and they don't clearly understand what it is but they think they should know about it and it seems like a new opportunity which it all is that being said when i was selling uh shopify courses back in the day what i would do when explaining it is i wouldn't present it as shopify because people knew what shopify was or at least they had some premise of it and the premise wasn't good because there's hundreds of shopify youtube channels out there showing all sorts of crazy stuff about shopify i didn't want to offer them something that they knew about because that doesn't seem like a new opportunity that they've missed out on it seems like something old that's been used up and saturated so what i did is i would talk about it before ever mentioning shopify's talk about it as a tactic that 711 and walmart have been using to make easy profits by shipping stuff in from china okay which is pretty much exactly true if you go and look at most drop shipping stores in most shopify stores they're selling the same things you see actually over the counter in 7-eleven but i explained it in that way to create a lot more interest with people they go whoa whoa what's this new method so when i see really good real estate ads they don't talk about how to make money in real estate they talk about how to make money by taking advantage of this new tax loophole that joe biden's administration just put forward now are they going to get into talking about making money with real estate and flipping houses with real estate yes but that's not the way they present the idea to peak people's interest you'll notice in health fitness working out there has been thousands of workout courses and i assume that maybe five percent of them at least have solved the way that humans need to exercise to get workout gains so why do people keep buying new workout courses because they want the new thing they want a new opportunity they want what they've been missing out on that's why the flavor of the month in health goes from uh assay berries okay berries i can't pronounce it to collagen to whatnot so whenever you're writing your copy or selling something online it always needs to seem like a new opportunity even if it's not and frankly it doesn't even matter if it is or not because the reason why we're presenting as a new opportunity is not to go and scam someone and make them think they're buying something they're not it's to get someone's attention at first then you can always explain with like hey this loophole that has been being used yeah that is shopify this loophole that's being used yet is collagen but you need to understand exactly why this is so huge okay so what you're doing is you're attracting attention by presenting as a new opportunity but you can always sell the old opportunity what people do when they come to a page or anything is they they bring their own existing beliefs about it so if people have seen a thousand dr axe collagen ads they're going to already have tons of ideas about what it is and think they already understand it that understanding is usually not what you're selling or not even connected to the benefit of what you're trying to do for people so it's just way better to present as a new opportunity and then once they it then you can start calling it by its actual name okay that's just some general tips at highrose for example we actually do help people's ai's target better okay but it just fits into that category of what i just described very well then finally with what i just said right here it has to sound realistic if you make something up like how to use the the kis handstand method to go and get some crazy results it's not going to sound realistic it has to sound like something that what actually legitimately exists that's why i love using tax codes that's why i use love using references to technology and existing brands and companies that already exist so the authority is already there if you look at a lot of ads where people are doing like stock ms and they don't talk about uh this is the brand new wave of crazies crypto stocks they talk about this is what jeff bezos just existed in or invested in they talk about things that already have attached authority to them so we actually covered two things right there that needs to seem like something new and it's something they're missing out on and finally the last thing you need to have it have is it needs to seem easy to apply copy and paste tracking script if you can go and put all these things into your opt-ins into your pitches into your sales videos you are going to keep people's attentions and you're going to get them to buy because these are the reasons why people buy things very very quickly if people believe it's going to get them a result in a short time frame they feel like they're missing out and it's a new opportunity and it's easy to apply you're going to do super well with ads and there's nothing else i can really add to this video there's this is the key to almost all copywriting if you just have these five things laid out in front of you as you're writing your opt-ins your sales videos or any ads that you're making you're going to do super well i really suggest after this video is done you check out some of the other ad
