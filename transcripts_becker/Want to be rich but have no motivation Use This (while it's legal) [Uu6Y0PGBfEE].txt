================================================================================

All right, look you sad sack of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] If you're demotivated, you don't have the energy to go and pursue getting wealthy or whatever the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you're trying to do. I have good news for you. See, look, if you've been browsing around on YouTube, people are going to tell you two things. One, you got to find your passion, something that excites your soul. And if you don't, you're [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The other part of YouTube is going to tell you motivation. If you don't have the willpower to grind and suffer for it, you obviously don't want it that bad. I think both of those are wrong. And I can tell you that because I wake up every single day at 3:00 a.m., usually rock hard as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to get to work. I am excited. I am aroused. I am fully phallic. In fact, the reason why I get up at 3:00 a.m., 4 a.m., you guys might have seen by my Instagram handle, is because I need to be up in this state when other people are asleep. Because if I'm outside with this level of a wreckness, with this level of motivation, I'm going to catch another public indecency and end up in jail. And let's face it, with this jawline, with these looks, I don't need to be there. I know some jiu-jitsu, but that's frankly gonna turn on the butt touchers even more because let's be frank, it's kind of a gay sport. A lot of butt grabbing, a lot of hugging other dudes. So, I don't think my martial arts skills, my blue belt, and manhugging and choking is going to help me there. So, that's why I get up at 3:00 a.m. Alas, what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] am I actually saying? I wake up fully motivated every single day, bust out 10 hours, and I work in ad tracking and analytics. Do you think as a child I sat down and put in my little dream journal, I'm going to work in ad tracking and analytics? Oh my god, I'm going to help people optimize their ads. No, I I didn't. Frankly, what I do ising boring, but it makes me millions of dollars per month and has built me a net worth of at this point over multiple nine figures. And what I'm going to do in this video is I'm going to show you how to unlock that motivation that I've had for decades through a systematic process that is predictable. You can just use this over and over again. Whenever you're not motivated, you can come back to this zen and you will be motivated again. I guarantee it. And it has nothing to do with finding your passion or your true motivation in life or grinding through it and suffering. So, let's begin. Let's talk about it. I'm going to give you a step-by-step process that I guarantee will make you motivated. You will have the ability to unlock tons of energy and tons of ambition by the end of this video. If you apply what I'm going to show you right here, I actually guarantee it. You have to understand the base level of this. And this is going to be something that you can use to solve almost any problem in your life when it comes to focus, motivation, or getting [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] done. So what a lot of people are going to tell you like I said before is you have to find your passion or you have to grind and suffer through it. Now both of these things are not necessarily wrong. Okay? For example, you see a lot of people like grind, you got to suffer for it. Yes, at some point you're going to get to points where there's boring periods and you just have to move through it. Other people are going to tell you have to find your passion. Yes, if you actually enjoy what you do and you get into it, you're going to really want to do it a lot more. This is easy peasy obvious [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] But the problem is with a lot of these things is that the passion that they trigger even if it's something that you enjoy. Like I enjoy working in ad tracking analytics. I really do. But the passion from that is not good enough to overcome what I'm going to talk about right here that's blocking you. The grind right here, the suffering is too painful and low dopamine for you to survive if you're in this state I'm about to talk about right here. So both these things while they will come into play and are important, you're not going to be able to overcome either of these things or achieve either of these things unless you understand what I'm about to show you right here. So don't throw these out the window. Okay? But we need to get back to the core layer right here. See, the way you need to go and look at motivation and energy is you need to actually look at removal. See, what a lot of people do when they're trying to particularly improve their focus or get better at anything, in this case, energy and motivation, is they think they need to have some complex routine, some crazy complex system to unlock their inner spirit animal of motivation and get this surge of energy and wisdom that only some Indian spirit guide can unlock. That's not how you [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do it. What you actually have to do is you have to analyze your life and focus on removal and getting back to the base point where motivation and energy is going to be unlocked. Let me put it this way. Let's imagine you reduced your life down to living in a 500t square room. Okay? You just have a bed, perfect food that unlocks perfect energy and health. Okay? You don't have access to the marijuana. You don't have access to pot. You don't have access to alcohol. You don't have access to cake or sugar or anything like that. You just have perfect healthy food right here. And then you have a computer computer terminal which blocks all video games and all social media and only thing you're allowed to do is to work. If you put yourself in this situation right here, I guarantee with 100% guarantee itness that you would find a way to make money and you would actually enjoy making money and you would work on making money and you'd wake up every single day excited to make money. Why removal? The most interesting thing to you in this space right here is going to be making money. See, the interesting thing about people is that if you really make them really bored and you get rid of all the things that are going to slow down their energy and clear up their brain fog, you're naturally going to want to do something. Like, it's impossible for you to sit there and do nothing. And if you put yourself in this state, you're naturally going to want to do something productive. And if you focus that productivity into building a business or making money or getting better at your craft or trade, I don't care what it is, you're going to get better at it very quickly. And it's going to be the most fun thing you do. So, let me back up and explain it like this. You might be looking at me and you might say, "Wow, this guy has the jawline. He has the boyish good looks. He's rich as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't think I could ever be as motivated as him. I don't think I could ever have the willpower attribute points that he has in his RPG character he's designed for his life." You can. Here's how. So, look, I have a business that generates me millions of dollars per month. You would think naturally that would be very, very interesting to me and I'd be motivated all the time. The thing is, if I boot up World of Warcraft, if I go back and start drinking every single week and I I I partake in the demon's nectar, I drink, I go and eat cake and eat badly, I stop working out and exercising, what will actually happen to me is I will get demotivated as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I guarantee you if I do these things right here, I've been in these states before where I find waking up and just eating bad food and playing World of Warcraft far more interesting than my business. I can make hundreds of thousands of dollars per day and I don't find it interesting at all. I don't even want to work on it. I'm completely demotivated. I can turn my motivation on and off like a switch. If I'm using a lot of social media and my brain is completely overloaded with video games, for example, I'm going to not be motivated to work in my business. You combine that with feeling brain foggy and shitty all the time from having a poor diet or smoking pot or drinking alcohol. Another thing that comes with alcohol as well is you're not going to be motivated or unlock your creativity for 3 to four days after getting really drunk, which I like to do. I don't I'm not a one to two drinks kind of guy. All right? If I sit down, I have an old fashion. I'm having a lot of old fashions. I know you Gen Zers don't drink anymore, but us us millennials, man, we like to get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up. So, don't don't get me wrong. I I enjoy good ham boning every now and then. That being said, if I'm doing that consistently, my motivation is going to be gone. So, I'm not saying I'm the perfect replica. You should try to replicate. But a lot of people wish they could wake up, have the motivation to build a business, and work on it for 5, 8, 10 hours a day. Well, I have that. And I can tell you point blank that I can turn that on and off on command by allowing or not allowing these things into my life. Another thing that will also go and destroy my motivation is massive amounts of distractions. Okay? If my priorities are not aligned with my business, for example, I have tons of people messaging me. I'm dealing with just a lot of irrelevant nonsense like house stuff, I don't know, chores. If I have toxic people in my life, this is also going to destroy my motivation as well. So, if you can see really quickly, how do I become motivated? It isn't because I have some unruly passion that cannot be contained or I'm grinding or suffering. Like, I don't wake up and grind and suffer every single day. A lot of people tell you that's what they do. If that's what they do, fanfuckingtastic. I work until I don't want to work anymore every day. I'm not sitting here like and then doing like a little time clock boot camp drill [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] every single moment when I'm working. So, coming back to this again, the goal is removal. And the way I really discovered this is if you watch my channel way back in the day when I wanted to go and build Hyros, my biggest software company. I have a bunch, but this is the one that makes the most money. And I wanted to get to the point where I had a 9 figure net worth. I just went and sold everything, moved into an empty apartment with just a desk and a bed and I worked on my software company with my expenses being super duper low for about 2 years. Doing this right here, this process of removal right here allowed me to just go and take over theing world. And that's because I got everything in line. I had no distractions. I had nothing to kill my motivation. I had no distractions as far as finances went cuz my finances were super low. Like I had no bills whatsoever compared to the amount of money I had bringing in. And so this right here unlocked turbo mode Alex. So how do we apply this to you? So what we need to again do for you is look at removal. So what I want you to do if you want to get very very motivated is we need to look at two aspects of you. All right. The circle of motivation right here. There is going to be your overall brain health and energy and then there's going to be your dopamine/distraction side. Okay, so this is very badly explained, but that's okay. If if I've hooked you this far in the video, you've already given me the watch time. Just get used to dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] content from this point. But what do I mean by this? So the first thing you need to do if you want to get motivated is you have to actually get your brain motivated. And in order for your brain to be motivated and to have the chemicals being released to make you motivated, you have to make sure that it has the ability to do that. If you're drinking a lot, if you're eating bad food, if you're not sleeping, if you're not exercising, your brain is not going to have the energy and fuel it needs to make you motivated, and thus it just won't. So, step one, if you want to be motivated, stop drinking for 60 days. Just give it a go. Stop smoking pot. Like, absolutely stop smoking pot. Stop eating bad food. Get your diet absolutely pristine and start exercising and start going to bed on time. You do those things, you're going to have the energy and motivation to do stuff. The end, that's that's all you have to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do. Just get your health in order. You don't even have to get to like Brian Johnson Healthy. Just remove the giant blocks and obstacles and the giant grill on your back that is your brain fog and bad health. And then you're going to have tons of motivation to do something. Okay? Now, we have to f then funnel this motivation into that something. And so what you need to realize is that most people's lives, their dopamine levels are just way too high for you to enjoy work. The end. So if you look at humans back in the day, the only thing they had to do was like hunt and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So what did they do? They just hunted and and tried to get the up the social ladder so they could [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] You have too many fun games to play right now in your life. You can literally load up World of Warcraft and you can have more fun playing that damn game than you can have doing most things in real life. Like I've played World of Warcraft for thousands of hours. I will tell you straight up, if you're deep into World of Warcraft level and grind stuff, it's more fun than real life. That's because these games are rigged to touch every single dopamine button in your head. It's cheating. I know it seems like something you like, but the game is actually rigged to mess with your brain and actually touch buttons and manipulate it to be addicted to the video games, which isn't really a real experience. This isn't something This isn't how your dopamine is supposed to work. Your dopamine is supposed to push you towards something that is hard and then pushes you to a reward that helps your life. Games are not actually hard. They're set up for you to win and they move you along and addict you by pushing buttons that make you feel like you're winning and then they reward you with something that doesn't actually positively benefit your life. It's an entire trick. So, while they are fun and everything, that's not actually benefiting you. Now, I'm not here to talk about games. I'm just here to reference how you view your dopamine. So when you're playing video games or you're on social media or you're doing high dopamine things all the time, what's going to happen is your brain is going to say or think like this. Your brain is an A to B animal. It doesn't use logic when deciding how to choose what it wants to do. So what it's going to do is it looks at I don't know if this is exactly how it works. Okay, some scientists, well actually the chem chemical reacts to your androgen receptors and no, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. This is how it works based on Alex Becker's very 10-year-old purple crown view of the world. So, it's an A to B machine and it's going to react based on the dopamine you get from something. So, for example, if you play video games, you're going to get an incredibly high amount of dopamine very quickly playing that thing. And so, let's imagine you get dopamine from working right here, but it takes much longer. And your brain sees the fastest way to point B or the big dopamine release is to play video games. It's not going to want to work. Even though work is what improves your life and improves every aspect of your life and makes everything better, it's going to say, "Okay, this this route right here to dopamine is by far the most optimal." So, we're going to do a lot of that and we're not going to do this. And so what happens when you're watching tons of TV, when you're on Twitter all day, when you're on social media, when you're playing video games, when you're doing just anything that's really too high dopamine all the time, your brain is going to optimize for those things because in its sense, what it's seeing and it's in its signals that it's getting to itself is that this is the best way to improve your survival, standing in life, and give you the best chance to reproduce. That's what dopamine is for. It's to increase your levels of survival. So, for example, back in the day, the only way to get dopamine if you were a human was to go out hunting. And then when you finally caught that animal, you got a big release of dopamine and you were motivated the entire time to do it. You don't have to do that anymore to get dopamine. You can literally just boot up Fortnite and you can get the same dopamine that used to take massive amounts of work in the past. And so, this is why your brain doesn't care about work and isn't motivated to do the things because it's already optimized to get the dopamine that it wants from somewhere else. So what you need to do with this knowing this is you need to cut off these sources right here. So the only place for it to get dopamine is the work. And guess what? Work is going to be by far the most interesting thing you're doing. Again, I restate if I am partaking in these high dopamine activities right here. I will not find my work despite the ridiculous results it gets me. Despite the ridiculous benefit I get from my life, I will not find it interesting. Despite it being 10 times more fulfilling long-term than playing a video game, I will not find it interesting. Thus, I bet you won't either. Finally, the last thing you want to do to unlock your motivation is eliminate all distractions. So, the most obvious distraction in most people's life is their finances. For example, one of the reasons why people can't focus on things is because they're always stressed about their bills and there's other stresses in their life, the people in it, the situations. Just think about all the things that are going on in your life that don't benefit you. Did you put an immense amount of effort and focus into? just remove all of them cuz then you're going to free up your brain actually think and it takes a lot of energy and willpower and grind to actually work through all these daily social problems and just life problems that most people have. So for example, if you are in an apartment that's stressing you out or you have a a financial lifestyle, even if you're not making a lot of money, if your financial lifestyle takes up a huge amount of your income, it's going to stress you out and you're constantly going to be thinking about it. You're going to be stressed. this is going to exhaust your brain uh and wear you out to the point that you're not motivated. You could in fact just reduce to zero. So what I did when I was growing my businesses, I was living in I was doing pretty well and I was living in this big mansion, Lamborghini and everything way back in the day. And it's not like I was making myself broke, but even at like 20% of my monthly income, I was really kind of just stressing out. and I was constantly dealing with house stuff and that was becoming like a full-time job because the house was so big and then there's managing all the payments for the cars and and it was just so much [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that was taking up my mind and cluttering up my mind. So, I just got rid of all of it and then there was people around me um friends, family, they're always taking up my time, distracting me. I just no. So, I moved to another city, got a completely empty apartment with just the desk and computer. Did what I'm doing right here. Got my diet and everything in check and boom, massive motivation because I had nothing else to do. I made more YouTube videos than ever. I worked more than ever. My creativity, my motivation to work was better than ever. And guess what? Within about two years, I'd actually grown my net worth to nine figures. And now using this process, I'm not as extreme as I used to be cuz I understand how to keep things in balance. Like, I don't touch video games for a reason. I don't allow myself to use social media for a reason. I don't drink consistently. I'll still I'll still have some benders every now and then, don't get me wrong, but I don't do that consistently. I don't smoke pot. I don't eat bad food. I exercise every single day for a reason. And so I've kind of optimized my life to be motivated. And that's why I'm pumped as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I'm making this video at 3:00 a.m. right now, excited, having a good time. And the reason I'm able to do is because the things I talk about in this video. So apply these things. Unlock your energy by improving your health and just get that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] straight first. Stop drinking. Stop smoking pot. Stop putting bad [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in your body. Exercise. Go to bed. Then remove all the dopamine disruptive things in your life. video games, TV, whatever you find yourself really doing that's not work, just get rid of it. For example, if you watch TV too much, smash your TV. You play video games too much, smash it. If you're on social media all the time, delete your social media accounts or uh have blocks on your computer and then just don't have your phone on you. Just put it somewhere else in the house. Boom. Done. Log out of everything. Don't have any of those apps in your phone. Then finally, all the distractions in your life, your finances, family, friends, anything that's just toxic, can catching up too much of your brain right now, get rid of it. And through this process of removal, I guarantee you at this point you'll be sitting in a room with just a bed, a computer desk, and access to work, you're going to find the work very, very, very [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] motivating. And this is all you have to do. This made me very rich. It will make you very rich if that's what you want to do. Or if you just want to like, I don't know, become a professional banjo player, the best in the world, the Tom Brady of Banjo, this will also work for that, too. It works for everything. So that's the video. Goodbye.
