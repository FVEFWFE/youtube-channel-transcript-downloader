================================================================================

the way most people test their ads on Facebook YouTube Tik Tok is stupid as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it's the most complex bureaucratic dumb process I've ever seen because what they're doing is they're testing too much at once in this video I'm going to show you a testing process you can use on any AD platform ma let's just call it Facebook I don't like calling it Ma we're going to call it Facebook Zuckerberg the name sticks this small ad Channel we've made the decision but Facebook Google Tik Tok this works everywhere and if you do this the ads are going to print money let me show you what you need to be doing instead so at my business hyos I speak with people that run ads all day long and we do a lot of their stats and analytics so I get all sorts of requests for all sorts of ways to split test their ads and analyze them and if you use Facebook at all you're going to get lost and because I used to do this and then my ads would get stuck at a couple million dollars per year in Revenue now our ads are doing near $30 million a year and I spend way less money on ads cuz the ads are just that much better and it doesn't come from having masterful copywriting or some magic sales funnel it understands what the customer is looking for and how to maximize that because that's what matters in ads and so there's a lot of different variables in ad testing and people get caught up trying to split test a thousand variables on the ad and so what they're going to do is they make an image or a video then they have the headline then they have the description and then they have the landing page and then they all these things there's so many different things going on and what they do is they try and test all these all at once and so they're looking at the video and then they're like well I also want to see like how the headline did and then how the description did and then what's the optin rate on the landing page this is so stupid because you will never actually get a coherent answer on what the customer wants and what's going to get them to convert here is what you want to do so the first thing you need to do when you're doing your ads is you have to understand the message that is going to convert customers what is the main thing that they want and is going to get them to do anything if I say I have a vehicle I want to sell you it's going to give you AIDS and then I say I have a vehicle I want to sell you it's going to make you better looking the one that says it's it's better looking is going to get more honey is going to get more customers than the one that's going to give you AIDS I know it's a very simplistic metaphor that I just made but what you need to understand about the point that I just made is If the message is correct it doesn't really matter how you say it obviously the message that is better and hits the customer correctly is going to convert higher than anything else you said and so what you need to First do with your ads is you don't even try to split testing videos you don't even try split testing headlines and descriptions and find the micro CPM whatevers that are going on that every single other media buyer and agency buyer does they try and make their ads grow through complication instead of Simplicity what you instead do is you find the message that connects with the customer remote so let's say I'm running ads for hyros and I've done all this since the beginning of time in hyros so I already know the answer is this I can run ads around tracking as the main benefit I can run ads around scaling as the main benefit I can run ads around saving money as the main benefit I can run ads around AI optimization and so what you do when you first start running ads is you don't you don't worry about any of the micro testing you want to go and make let's say in this situation five videos or five different ads focusing on a different message and you send people to a very generic landing page whether it's to get a call an opin or a sale okay the landing page is just simply not optimized and so what you want to do with this is you don't look at the micro testing right here you look at what message gets people clicking the most and buying the most now if you want to get a little bit more specific with this we can make a landing page for each one so for example I could make a highis landing page where the top headline Focus around tracking scale saving seven each and then I want to see which ad performs the best and that's going to tell me usually which message people are most interested in then when I'm going to do once I find it let's say scaling is the top message okay then what I'm going to do is I'm going to start testing and optimizing around that so I'm going to get rid of tracking savings AI uh this generic page right here and I'm going to go back to drawing board again so what we're doing is we're testing one variable at a time first variable we tested was the message okay so now I'm going to make all my ads scale so what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a landing page based around scale I'm not going to optimize it more than once it's just going to be one landing page based around scale whether it's the opt-in call that's the focus of the landing page that's the only focus we're not going to try and Pitch tracking a optimization all this other stuff in that we want to get the main thing that people are interested in and when people use hyos on average their ad scale another 15.3% this is tested across thousands of businesses major companies like Tony Robbins Playboy basically every influencer in the space Pier One Etc they all use it for that exact purpose that's why we literally have a guarantee that if you don't see that scale you don't pay for it and those selling points are what I'm going to focus around and it's also why you're pretty goofy if you're running ads and not running hyros everything I just stay there 100% on point but back to this I'm going to make the landing page just around scale and then what I'm going to do is I want to get back to testing one variable so I'm going to make five different ads all with the same headline all with the same description I'm just going to make five different videos okay one 2 3 4 5 and in these videos what I'm going to do is I'm only going to focus on the hooks in the video they're all going to be focused around scale so there's going to be the beginning of the video and then there's going to be the rest of the video the rest of the is going to stay exactly the same and what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at what Hooks perform well the first 5 to 10 seconds the first 10 seconds of what happens in the ad and I'm going to see the hooks that do best okay once I see the hook that does best I'm going to restart that again again the headline descriptions everything else is not being altered right here this is the core difference what most people doing is they're testing all these things at all times all the time I'm going to look at the hooks that did well and then I'm going to go grab that hook that did well and then make five other variations of that hook maybe with different positioning where I'm at wherever so a lot of videos I started off the video with like an Iron Man USB it was very attention grabbing and I'd say this copy and paste this little script and will improve your ads 15% or something like that that was one of the earlier ads at hus when I saw that worked best I made five different variations so I put like a version of the code in the top hand corner or I'd be at a computer screen already with the results already being shown I just make different variations of that hook once you've done that once it's good enough all right like stop optimizing the hook now what we want to do is we want to go and optimize the middle of the video so let's imagine we've narrowed it down the three hooks so we have three hooks then what we want to do is we want to make three different middles of the video or ad if you're using image ads you can just stop here we can move on to the next part then what we're going to do is we make three variations of the middle of the ad to those hooks so we have a total of nine ads we didn't run that we're going to see which middle does the best then what we're going to do is we're going to reduce down to the middle that does the best and leave it with these ad ads whenever we want to go and we're getting ad blindness we just add a few more hooks okay so we have the best possible hook with a very effective middle this is good enough then what do we do we start optimizing the landing page all right we're going to optimize the headline that's on the landing page the page itself the rest of it get that to good enough principles then finally this is where we get to the headline of the ad this is where we get to description I don't even optimize descriptions if you're down to description you've already won so hard that it doesn't matter we're going to start optimizing the headline and for the headline and the scriptions in Facebook Google whatever we're not optimizing the conversion rates or anything on the page those should already be taken care of by everything we've done so far all we're going to do with the headline and description is we're going to optimize The Click through rate just to get clicks as low as possible so everything we optimize for up until the headline and description is simply going to be the end result which is the cost per call the cost per lead the cost per sale once we get the headline description we're not going to deal with that anymore we're just going to optimize for clicks and this is the process you can get to and this will get you to your best performing ads that you can use pretty much year round of course there's specials there's other things you can do like for example we're ending the Black Friday phase of the market where people are optimizing for that hyros so of course I'm creating some ads based around that cuz people make so much more damn money if they use hyros on Black Friday it's like 20% more whereas if you do a million dollars a day in sales on Black Friday like some e-commerce storees like like an extra $200,000 just from tracking your ads correctly but whatever don't do that but that's what the ads focus on so I'm running ads using that same process I just showed you but for Black Friday in a four-month period And if you're running your business and your head of marketing you have time to really like make this process and repeat it over and over again many times a year using different angles based on the timing of the year so for example at highrisk when the iOS update dropped I I'd use this angle when it was working when we're getting around the Black Friday phas I'd use that kind of angle in messaging and so the process is messaging hooks middle of videos lining page then headlines then description and then call it good if your ads are not converting after you've done this your offer itself stinks which is why you should watch this video and then the video which is about getting your offer aligned with the market if you want to see the ad scripts and landing pages that I use these are what these videos are for I have nothing else to talk to you about goodbye
