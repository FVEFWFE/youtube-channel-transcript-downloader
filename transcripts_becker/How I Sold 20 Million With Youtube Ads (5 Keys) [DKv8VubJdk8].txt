look guys i'm going to be straight when it comes to youtube ads i'm probably the best source of information on internet i'm not going to toot my horn on that if you look at my youtube ad mastermind i have the most results of anybody online i've sold over 20 million dollars worth of products on youtube ads and i'm the ceo of the fastest growing ad tracking company in the entire world i'm sorry i know that sounds egotistical i don't mean to toot my horn quite that loud i'm even a little bit embarrassed to say all those things but it's just true and when it comes to youtube ads i can tell you what's going to work and what i see happening across the industry and how i see most people run their youtube ads it just doesn't work it's counterproductive what they're going to try and achieve in this video i'm going to show you exactly what i've learned across all my years running youtube ads everything i've seen in the data and everything i've learned working with people on their youtube ads if you apply this simple stuff and i'm not going to give you complicated stuff that's like hey all you need to do is split ses 200 pages and find the right color variation of this button no there's very simple things you can do at the beginning of your ads ways you can run your ad account ways you can run your targeting that most people just don't do that is going to increase your ad roi significantly if you watch this video i can almost guarantee it if you run youtube ads one percent of people do the things i'm talking about right here so we're just gonna dive straight into that also you should subscribe to this channel if you run ads for your business because on this channel i tell you everything i've learned from my near decade of running ads generating tens of millions of dollars in sales and what i've gained insights wise from running the fastest growing ad tracking company in the world hirose why because i want your ads to grow and if your ads grow you're probably going to need better attribution which is an absolute key to running ads correctly and so you'll probably pick up hyrus so if i help you you'll probably want to help yourself even more by picking up pyros that being said let's focus on the first goal helping you actually make your work better so okay guys so let's just dive into it and i'm gonna break this down into five things like our last video on facebook where i showed how i've sold over 10 million dollars worth of product if you just get these things right here nobody really does these things or gets these and they just keep they dive they keep bulldogging straight into these errors and you're just never going to get good results on youtube if you do these things by far the number one is not understanding how the targeting works and understanding how to target broad or narrow audiences so what do i mean by this so consistently i'm just going to use the make money online niche because it's just an easy one to explain using this but it applies to literally everything what people do let's say we're selling to people that want to start a consulting agency there's there's three spectrums of people there's absolute beginners who uh have never even considered starting a consulting agency they just want to make money quickly then there's intermediate people who have thought about starting a marketing agency but you know haven't made any money doing it or have been unsuccessful at it or they're like they've heard about the idea and then there's people that are actually making money like five to anywhere to a hundred thousand a month with their consulting business so what everybody does on facebook and the reason why they can't scale on facebook and why they can't even get on youtube in the first place is because they try to target right here they make something that's for beginners but also for people that are already successful at the idea the problem is this is a terrible terrible terrible way to run ads it's the worst business structure ever because this is actually the smallest hardest to target audience ever because not only are they small they don't also have any money because they're not making any money doing what they're doing or if you were to look at this in other terms like if we're looking at like golf clubs or something like this the person's really is is interested in the niche there's there's few of them though there's people that are interested in getting better at golf or let's say already play a few rounds of golf but also don't take it seriously so not as they're they're few of them but they also don't really want to invest in money so it's just like the worst market to get into ever and this is what people try to talk mostly on facebook in order to work on youtube you can't do this at all because this right here works to about a thousand to two thousand dollars a day on facebook afterwards it doesn't work because what happens is these people right here are repulsed by a product it's even slightly for beginners and these people right here don't even know what consulting is so you're not you can't sell to them they don't know what it is and so because this niche right here is so small and they don't even have that much money you just are marketing the worst possible people you're way better off marketing down your audience and selling a 10 000 product 10 000 product to these people or going exclusively broad and focusing on people that don't even know what a consulting agency is for example if you've ever seen sam evans offer he doesn't market the people that sort of want to get into consulting or people that already have consulting businesses he markets that people have never even heard or knows you can do a consulting business on the internet this is a mass broad audience and this is a targeted narrow audience you can't do this in-between thing and this is what people do on youtube and they die because you can't target this effectively on youtube you can target this effectively on facebook but again it's a terrible audience so you can't even scale with it when you get into youtube you want to go exclusively to the beginners to the broadest part of the audience which is going to be almost 80 of the marketplace or you want to go exclusively to the high-end people which is going to be 10 the marketplace these people right here are also 10 but they don't have any money so let's say if we're going to go and make a hundred thousand dollars we could sell 10 products these people at 10k or we could sell 50 products to beginners at 2 000. if we go right here with like a 2 000 product that's meant for both of them these people won't bide enough rate to make the uh the roi make sense and beginners won't bid enough rate for the ad to have roi and so when you get into youtube understand that where youtube really excels is broad targeting it excels at this this beginner focused audience right here because really you just have thousands and thousands of people and you can't really narrow down to their specific interest or business interest though we can easily do something like this on a narrow audience so say we're selling to let's say people that run sas companies we can easily target people watching sas accelerator videos but we don't want to make a 99 product to them a thousand dollar product we want to make a 5 000 to 10 product okay so this is actually two lessons in one first only focus on these audiences right here if you do anything else you're gonna fail go ahead try it do it i work with people in my mastermind all day i have the youtube mastermind with the most results of any other online any other online we absolutely smash you can click below this video and see all the results we get in that you can even just sign up for a call if you're a good fit we can work together i'm not focused on that right now i'm focused on telling you i have seen this literally hundreds of times people come in they try and do like this intermediate stuff and they get absolutely washed and this is why they can't get on youtube it doesn't work okay so the next lesson i'm going to give you is you got to go you got to price appropriately so the best prices are again like we talked about in the facebook video high ticket prices so when we're going to beginners we really want to go and have the upper priced product in our industry so if we're like in supplements are working out this is gonna be something that's 197 to 497. if it's in like business or education or something like that would be like one thousand two thousand dollars if we're in b2b which is very narrow targeting we're going to want to go 5 000 to 10 or as low as 3 500 and we're going to want to use probably a long winded webinar funnel for these type of products or a call funnel for these type of products so that's actually three lessons for you why high ticket i talked about this last video but let's break it down one more time so look if we have a if we get a thousand opt-ins for ten dollars let's say ten bucks a pop and we get a thousand we just paid ten thousand dollars in order to break even on this let's imagine we have a ten percent conversion rate on a ten dollar product heck let's say a hundred dollar product okay hundred dollars which is pretty uh pretty expensive if we have a hundred if we have a ten percent conversion rate which is never going to happen i've never seen that before ever and we sell 100 100 products we just made 10 000 okay we broke even with the best conversion rate on planet earth if we take this down to 10 dollars we only made a thousand dollars now if we go through and we get a much more realistic we just spent ten thousand dollars for the same thousand people and we spent 10k but we have a 2k product if we if we get a 1 conversion rate 10 people we just made 20 000 this is easier to do because the same people that would have bought at that ten dollar price that hundred dollar price one percent of them would have bought at the 2k price because they're super interested this right here makes our lives a lot easier because now we have a 2x roi on our ads which we can scale with high ticket just always works better so whether you're doing supplements even you're doing a smaller low ticket thing like a workout product or something like that you want to go and try to batch everything together to make a high-ticket product i know i get this question all the time in e-commerce if you're doing e-commerce find a way to package all your products together into a big old package and then throw info into it so let's imagine your products right here are worth 200 is all combined and then we can go and sneak info marketing into it for another two hundred dollars okay but it costs us nothing to provide the info this gives us the margins right here to charge four hundred dollars and run this to ads this is how you do it okay you can use a webinar funnel or a really really really really solid vsl okay that's what you want to do this info extra margin right here allows you to pay for all those leads coming in and optimize the ads to actually scale that's exactly why we want to do it now watch the video on this channel that talks about selling high ticket high ticket funnels and high ticket products because i just don't see how you can scale well effectively on youtube doing low ticket that's why so many people can't make it work okay and that's going to break down exactly how to sell these products and how to sell them high ticket it's on the channel there's so much free training and courses on here you should just use it the next thing in it's not about it's not about looking good or having a great looking video ad it is about nailing the message and so what i see people constantly do is they make these cinematic really high effort ads no no no my most productive ad of all time was a powerpoint presentation and again on this channel there's a link to my exact script i use for that what you need to understand about youtube first and foremost is that ugly fast rapid to produce ads are the best for two reasons one there's no proof that the really well filmed ads do better there just literally isn't number two if you can get out ads out quickly you can quickly see which ones work and which ones don't and you're going to see what message in the ad works and doesn't work very quickly and so when you see a message that works you can start split testing different messages for example you can say i'm gonna show you to start your first shopify business versus i'm gonna show you how to make five thousand dollars per month passively okay oh the five thousand dollars per month passively won the split test okay i'm gonna show you to make five thousand dollars uh per month pastly from home okay that one worked better and the one that talked about uh going and starting it and if i said i'm going to show you to make five thousand dollars a month flipping objects you can find in a grocery store oh that didn't work as well and you can keep going and doubling down this message and kind of do this yes no pattern until you get to a message that really really converts people you can't do that if you're doing well shot fancy ads you just can't because you can't produce them fast enough and you can't optimize them enough it takes you like a day to shoot the ad you're going to have to run probably 15 20 ads before you even get to the correct message and then another 20 30 different ads before that message is optimized uh and the video is convincing enough so powerpoints work just fine okay powerpoints work just fine me sitting at my desk talking to you like i am right now those have been my best performing ads there's no evidence that these super well shot ads work next in the first five seconds of this is this the last tip i'm going to give you first five seconds what you need to do is you need to attract your target audience or you need to focus on this actually what you need to do is get attention get everyone's attention lock in super hard get your main audience's attention and get them hooked with a benefit and repulse everybody that's not your target audience why do we want to do that well first thing we need attention so we can get a high view rate and so that we can catch our target on the audience period if we don't have their attention from the get-go it's not going to work but as soon as we have that attention we need to hook them immediately by not batting around the bush and make it very clear this ad is not for these people because if these people are watching our ad we're going to be paying for them viewing for the ad and if these people are watching our ad it's not clear what we're up to our target audience is going to bounce off most of the time so if you watch my ads i i do something to get someone's attention like i have this thumb drive i throw it in their face and say this thing right here will save you 15 on your ads i guarantee it something like that why i use a little bit more complicated words than that and my best ads ever are broken down on this channel but why do i say that one the stick which is a different color to my face and i jam in someone's face gets their attention people say what is this thing i say this will save you this ai optimization will save you 15 on your ads i guarantee it or you do not pay that is a hook that will hook only that run ads everybody else on planet earth is gonna go i don't i don't run ads and they're just to bounce i get a very high view rate then i lock in my target audience then i repulse everybody that's not my target audience in five seconds this is the golden key right here it most people start their ad i saw one other day where i was talking about his marketing agency and he's like walking down the street in front of his car and it took him 15 seconds from even say this was about making money he's just like you know i used to go to college and blah blah my parents used to tell me this thing and that by that time no one no one cares no one effing cares at all all right and you've probably got a bunch of people let's say you got like a lambo in the background or i don't know you just have something attention grabbing you have cats running around what's going to happen is people are going to watch the cats that aren't your target audience and your target audience is going to bounce specifically if you're doing like b to b or something like that because you just have a bunch of people watching it for the cats and all the people that are interested in b2b are going to move on to their video because they don't want to watch your damn ad that is such a huge key and then finally guys here's the last tip i have for you when it comes to tracking sales accurately i like google adwords the tracking out of the box it's it's good enough for just like a general like here's sort of what's going on but if you're running your ads based around leads opt-ins only especially if you're doing info marketing or sales which i know a lot of you guys are but that tracking is not accurate if you are making decisions off of inaccurate tracking you are wasting literally 15 to 20 of your ad spent on campaigns that are not actually generating sales that you think they are and you are also going to be cutting off 15 20 of your scale because you're going to kill ads they're actually scaling check this out now of course i can go in the hirosh dashboard now of course guys i can go inside the highrose dashboard and get the results load up in front of me but i just like to use the chrome extension because i can just see it right here inside the dashboard look this is how many calls i got from this ad right here it says i got one in google i got eight okay if i turn off this ad i'd be turning off something that makes me tens of thousands of dollars a month okay literally we make up to about a thousand bucks per call at hybro so i'd be losing literally an extra seven thousand dollars a month in near profit just doing that okay and i can click here and see everybody that came in and i can click on their history and see everywhere they came from and verify it i have this person literally opted in in 2020 and it's 20 21 right now i tracked them the entire way through through multiple email addresses and ips okay that's something google's never going to do and if you don't have this accurate date in front of you you're going to make the wrong decisions for example right here it told me i had three calls i only had two so my cost per call is actually way higher than what they're reporting it's not 500 it's 750 this is an ad i should probably turn off and losing me money and again right here here's another one perfect right here my cost per call is lovely at 200 33 google only caught one it's telling me 467 i might want to turn that one off and again the under reporting and over reporting and even if you're not even tracking the revenue by the way i was able to track this person through their click and then track them all the way to their phone calls that happened offline and get the sale if you're running your ads around leads or or calls and you're not actually looking at the exact roi you're just bonkers you're just bonkers okay so you need to be tracking something accurately if you're doing anything in any kind of scale on adwords and you have multiple traffic sources use some tracking sources solution i know that yeah i'm technically the ceo of hyrus but if you're not using something like at least use one of our competitors or something and if you don't see the same results i'm talking around here you again don't pay for it at high risk and we can also feed all this data back to make the ads much more targeted and optimize and train the ai google much better again you don't see that type of result you don't see a 15 20 increase in your ads you don't pay for hiros so again that's the last tip i know i'm a little bit biased in this regards as a co but there you go guys those simple things right there stuff that most people don't do when they're using youtube if you just do these things you're going to have such an edge up if you want to check out high risk of that tracking i just talked about all you need to do just click below you can book a call with us we guarantee results you don't pay for it on top of that that youtube mastermind that i mentioned below you can check that out
