================================================================================

so i know you see the title of this why facebook ads fail and most people make titles of this on their videos and they act like they know why as the ceo of hirose i see so many ad accounts i've worked with hundreds of people in my iron mastermind who run ads i can literally tell you why ads fail i can tell you exactly why some facebook ads scale to the moon and youtube ads as well and some facebook ads never take off and in this video i'm going to show you exactly why this is not a debate this is not theory this is not me like calculating and get clickbait this is literally why this is literally the difference between super successful ad campaigns and non-successful ones if you get this you can mess up almost everything else and you will still win if you do not get this you could have the best ad targeting the best optimization how you could have the the frank sinatra of running ads in your account and it will not work so take the 15 minutes to understand this because this is how i generate a 10 to 15x roi in my ads well not doing anything that complicated while people doing super complicated things can barely even generate a 1.5 x this is why so pay attention okay guys so this is a simple lesson but it's probably the most important lesson in all of paid advertising i can't stress that enough i know i say hey this is a very important video all the time this is the foundation everything builds on as the ceo of hyros again i'm never going to share anything i see clients personally doing or anything like that i can see the problems that are absolute plagues in the industry and this is by far the number one one if you don't have this understanding you are never going to do well with ads even if you are a master of ads let me explain see i've said this before but i really want to break this down i see people all day try to go and become millionaires or grow their businesses or grow their clients businesses within the ad account they're trying to get the the targeting correct they're trying to get the specific ai optimization correct they're trying to get the exact manual bidding correct they're doing micro audiences and splitting it down they're literally doing albert einstein level stuff that i don't do in my account and my account generates almost a 10 to 15x roi in my ads so am i saying this stuff right here isn't going to help no of course if your if your business is doing really well with ads doing this is going to increase the roi by 20 30 50 percent 50 being excessive i've really never seen anybody grow their business by doing these things massively but what people are failing to understand is that first and foremost for ads to work it's as simple as if you walked into a room of people let's say there's a hundred people that are in the ad space for example okay let's actually say this is in the weight loss space and then let's say there's 10 of you you there's 10 businesses that walk in let's even remove ad spend from this equation if all 10 businesses present their offer okay i'm not sure that's ten but the offer that is worded and the most enticing the offer that is most desired by the marketplace and needed and the offer that is also the hottest and most hyped up is going to do the best that's three places where offers live or die let me repeat that the offer that has the best messaging and best communication or the offer that is most needed in the marketplace or the offer that is just simply in the hottest angle at the current moment the most hyped up angle is going to do the best and if it has all three of those things it is going to absolutely dominate the room and what you need to understand about dominating the room in this instance right here is if the room is dominated in this instance it will also dominate in ads because what's going to happen in advertising is the same exact thing that's going on as i just described in this room you have tons of businesses tons tons tons of businesses presenting to 100 million people instead okay but in your niche in particular let's just let's just say 100 000 people and the way you get the best roi on your ads is not by doing this this crazy optimization stuff right you're never going to outdo an offer you're never going to beat the roi you're never going to have that breakout moment until you are this offer you are that offer that has those three things or one of those three things are all those three things the more of those things you have the better you're going to do with ads for example at highrose right now tracking is very hot for example the reason why my ads at hi-ros do so exceptionally well is first off the market really needs what i'm selling two tracking is extremely hot right now it's all the rage so it's also hot three my messaging and my funnel is incredible okay i present my ad my ad presentation the way the ads are constructed the way the funnel works the way the sales team closes it is superior to any other offer on the market that's similar okay maybe not the best funnel ever made but in tracking and for the most part most b2b ad based offers it is absolutely by far the best you combine those three things together and that's why i can do i'm just going to throw out a random number right here we can easily do 20 to 40 000 a day off of very very little ad spend because we have these three things but what i constantly see people try to do is they say all right what's in the marketplace right now and they try and make an offer that's not hot at all for example a really good example this is sam evansconsulting.com sam originally made this offer when it was very needed in the marketplace and if you don't know what this offer is it's just it's just a very well known info offer where sam taught people how to make consulting businesses and i believe they've done like 20 to 30 million dollars worth of sales and they really set the pace for the entire industry with this offer there's many other offers similar to this like you know for example alex and rosie's gymlaunch.com and you argues accounting.com russ ruffinos i his coaching consulting program thing all these offers have been breakout offers and what they always had is first off the marketplace really needed it okay it was also hot it was new okay when i'm just gonna use consulting.com as an example right it was new like nobody was really teaching this in a way that was this expect this effective and finally also sam i know personally because i've i've just known him for a long time spent so much time on that funnel and messaging and getting the ability to convert the right people that came in that it had these three things right here and it made oodles of money it's one of the most successful info offers of all time but then what people did is they tried to replicate to this day they still replicate it i and my iron mastermind i constantly see people uh that come in and try and just completely rip off these the offers i just mentioned i can't tell you how many uh agency offers or grow your first consulting business offers i see and people's ads don't work and they think hey is it because i don't have the optimization set i don't have some specific targeting is my ai back in learning phase i cannot tell you how many people i see come into iron or try to use hi-ros and they they think that their entire business lives and dies by the pixel on facebook which again the pixel on facebook is important but it's only going to give you a 15 increase okay if you're targeting everything is perfect it's going to give you a 15 to 20 increase tops that's not enough to turn a business that's not working or breaking even into an explosively successful business and so what people try and do is they go and try and replicate sam's offer but it's not new on the marketplace anymore okay it's not needed there's already there's sam's course is already out there and there's already like 15 other courses that are also comp competent it's not hot okay consulting simply is not hot people are way more interested as i shoot this video and amazon fba that's that's what people are really interested in the info marketing make money online space and this can apply to everything i just know this space pretty well and then finally their messaging simply isn't as refined the funnels and all the marketing and the sales copy it just isn't it isn't there and so they have none of these advantages and so then they try and go to their their advertising and they spend they pay some super agency they take all these courses they take all these classes on optimizing their ads and getting everything perfectly right everything's dialed down to a t they're doing the most complicated demographic targeting i've ever seen they're optimizing their ai and doing manual bidding in ways that i can't even comprehend as as a person it is not the most successful ad runner of all time but i've generated tens of millions of dollars that came in at a significant roi so i know what i'm talking about and it doesn't work and it's because they're missing these foundations right here when you're thinking of running your business on ads when you're thinking of taking your business on ads you need to look at the market the best advice i can ever give anybody when it comes to running paid advertising and getting very successful at paid advertising is the first thing you should do is look at the market and what does the market need what is the market obsessed about ak what is hot and then what messaging will the market respond to okay so for example the messaging the market will respond to and the make money online space would be a new opportunity that's hot and push button for example i'm going to say at hiros i'm going to make up something right here but when i was using one message that focused on scaling ads and i was using another message on focusing on ai the ai message responded better and then so i constructed the funnel based around ai and that type of optimization while moving and selling things in a certain way that i knew would convert and i improved the messaging and that's when my ads also took off as well so that's what messaging is and so you need to look at this because what most people try and do is they try to take something that is not hot it's not needed and the messaging is not anything that's that's going to really entice people because it's either been said before or it's just not enticing in the first place and this is usually done by people trying to sell what they want to sell instead of what the market wants and so they're messaging reeks of what they want to sell and guess what the market doesn't buy what you want to sell it buys what it wants to buy okay if the market wants a washing machine that is dyed pink and poops bubbles out the back in and fills your house with a disco strobe light but you want to sell a classy upper class washing machine doesn't really matter the market's going to buy that disco ball washing machine then the whole point of this lesson is once you achieve these things right here it is actually extremely easy to run ads even if you're not that good at it now what do i mean by this i'm very good at running ads i'm very good at writing ad copy i've again generated tens of millions of dollars off of much less ad spend than that that being said nothing i really do these days on youtube or on facebook is something that i would say is super out of reach of a beginner i'm not saying in this video if you're a beginner you should get in the ads you're gonna make a ton of money i don't think you'll make much money at all okay i'm saying what i'm doing is not really outside the realm of learning of a person in about two months of ad running there's nothing i'm really doing that's that complicated that you couldn't learn to do in two months very efficiently even less than that now of course i have some instincts and other things that are built upon that but what i'm trying to stress right here is that there's no secret to my ads beyond besides these things and just good ad copy there's no magic ai targeting there's no magic there's no magic deep crazy thing going on with my bidding it is simply understanding this foundation right here and with that being said because i have this foundation i greatly outperform people that make the complicated stuff we talked about earlier their foundation i absolutely destroy them it's not even close roi wise my i have them one of the most cash profitable ad funnels ever that i've ever seen and it's because i don't focus on this and this is why facebook ads fail in the most obvious simple way that i could ever describe they feel because people ignore the market and focus on the ad platform optimization it needs to go the other way around ninety percent of your focus or at least eighty percent needs to go on the offer and what the market is doing that's it if you get that right you can have bad ads and will still work one of the most successful businesses i know they made close to 100 million dollars in sales off of very little ad spend their funnel i'm not insulting it it was not anywhere near as optimized as 90 of the funnels that you see online right today it just was not it was a very very simple basic one page funnel their profit margins were insane it's because they nailed this and their ads were okay their ads are good i'd say they're in the top 70 top 25 percent of ads but they had this and this is where the profits came from it didn't come from that and all day long at hiros i watch ad managers freak out over this and completely ignore the other thing and then they're they're constantly shocked why their ads aren't profitable and do not scale that's the point that's absolute point then the final thing i would add to that track your ads with hieros if you are not tracking your ads with hiros you are literally wasting and making 15 to 20 less than you should be from your ads by default if you're making 100 000 a month from your ads you can make an extra 20k a month very easily that's an extra 200k a year for doing literally nothing except that's actually more than 200k tracking your ads correctly and making good ad buying decisions on top that if you want help actually making your offers
