================================================================================

hi rulings very simple in this video i'm going to break down a sales video that is generating my business anywhere from 15 to 20 usually uh but on good days 30 000 to 35 000 a day in revenue i want to stress me completely honest with you that's not 100 profit because high rose has a lot of hard cost however revenue wise i'm going to be spending about 1500 to 2 000 a day in ads and we take that in in pure hard revenue cash long story short this sales video works and frankly i've never seen anything generate an roi like this i'm going to break down the exact sales processes why i'm doing everything in it and hopefully you can copy some of these tactics for your ads and your sales funnels and get better results than you're doing right now because i i don't want to toot my horn too hard i don't know anyone whose funnels convert like this i actually i do know one and he made about a hundred million dollars doing it and a lot of this funnel is based on that funnel so that being said enjoy this is a long video but i guarantee this is gonna be some of the most impactful stuff you ever see on top of that i'm gonna do one little shameful pitch if you like what you're seeing right here and you want more of it you want me to help you with your ads coach you on your ads help you grow your business via youtube book a consultation with me below you might be really good for my ad master group we'll hop on a call we'll break down exactly how you can start scaling your business with youtube ads also all the funnels the copywriting behind it you should check it out it's below let's begin all right boys and girls listen up because i kid you not people have paid me tens of thousands of dollars for me to explain what i'm about to do for you right here so that's not to toot my horn that's the most arrogant way to start just just pay attention it's gonna be cool content okay sorry to be a jerk this is worth billions of dollars but i'm gonna walk through this video with you for about the first eight to the seven to eight minutes because this is where the magic happens and again like i said in the intro this video right here is easily generating about 20 to on good days 30 to 35 000 a day and it's so simple it's a very very easy video and if you understand what i'm doing in this video especially this seven minutes right here i think you'll do really well because it does really well for me and i've never seen anything generate this type of roi i'm not trying to sound like amazing after like a decade of doing this nothing has worked this well so let's just begin the first thing you're going to see when we actually look this video is i have a video playing right here that looks like i'm about to start talking and then has me counting down and then it resets and then i have this arrow right here most important thing is you you don't want your video to just start right away because then people aren't prepared for the video but if you just have an image right there sometimes people aren't going to make the effort to press the video so if you get their attention with something going on right here and you're counting down it gets their attention and they can kind of start the video on their own terms this just works better based on the stats so let's begin let's just cut to the chase hyrus is a software that combines print tracking and ai optimization and it will instantly allow you to scale your ads much further it will allow you to instantly save at least 15 percent on your ad spend without any decrease in sales and it will also improve your ad platform ai's and allow them to find you customers cheaper guaranteed literally we have a 90-day guarantee at hiros because we consistently and predictably delivered that exact result all right so let's talk about those first 30 seconds because they're extremely important what a lot of people do these days is they just waste so much time in the first 30 seconds introducing themself or doing something this is going to apply whether you're doing b to b this is going to apply whether you're doing b to c especially online when people are so used to sales videos at this point maybe like back in 2015 people weren't used to sales videos they weren't used to this but they you really don't have people giving you the time of day especially if their attention spans they are so what i like to do is strongly cut is strongly cut to the chase because at least in my opinion b2b you have to think about the context of the customer who is who's watching this video it's it's probably a business person a person that buys ads that is so used to business videos and people wasting their time that they are going to give you about a minute so what i like to do is i like to make a big huge bold promise and then guarantee it and this is one of the benefits to selling a product that always gets results because then you can do this everything i just stated right there hirose does more importantly instead of focusing on myself for random things i just simply tell them look this is exactly what you're going to gain from this video i guarantee it i don't have any benefit to talk to you because if this doesn't do what i say it does you don't have to pay for it that is such a bold hook because because the reason why this person is watching this video is because they want to make more money from their ads they want to get the result that they're looking for if i go hard and heavy with the result and guarantee it and then show all the results for example in this page there's good 20 results of people getting really really good results with hiros there's huge brands they're going to say all right maybe there's something to this that's what we need to cross right there that's the line we're looking for maybe there's okay maybe there's something to this now look i've spent tens of millions of dollars on ads over the course of my career if you told me what i just told you i'd say where do i sign up as long as i know that it works and two as long as i understood how it works which is what i'm going to accomplish in this video very quickly now first off you're probably thinking this sounds like a bunch of buzz words how do i even know this is real you know it's real because if you look below on this video or you look on this video you're going to see brands like tom bylew's okay the next thing that's very important here is i made this huge crazy promise and now what i'm doing is i'm telling them i'm relating to what they're thinking because when you make big bold promises what most marketers don't do is they don't address that there's an elephant in the room um and the elf in the room is that people think you're full of bs they think you're full of it okay no one trusts anybody and that's exactly how it should be so what you need to do is say look i know what i just told you sounds absolutely nuts i would think the same thing and they go oh okay well maybe this guy's on the same page as me then what i do is say look here's why it's not nuts and i need to prove to them that it's not nuts and kill the cell phone in the room what a lot of people do is they just raise past this and they ask for the sale of the phone call the elephant in the room is still there and what happens is that elephant comes and swats the phone out of the person's hand says this guy's full of crap you need to think of what a customer is thinking think of what a person is thinking before they think it that's literally all that copywriting is and you need to think about what they're going to think and what you need them to think at the end of the video and you need to think about what you're going to say to them and how they're going to react to what you're saying and then how you're going to counter or build on what they're saying in relationship to their goals or their objective which is their objective here is to make more money from their ads if i can just make them understand and truly believe in their heart of hearts that if they sign up for harass they will make more money from their ads and it's risk free then they'll do it so what i need to do right here is i need to knock out the skepticism those impact theory.com using us you're gonna see clickfunnels.com then graziosi and tony robbins mastermind.com you're going to see one of the largest earning funnels of all time on click funnels alex from marsy's gymlaunch.com you're going to see people with large reputations when it comes to running ads such as dan henry using hiros you're even going to see massive influencers like full-time filmmaker who has well over a million followers on youtube using hiros why because it works and if so this is just a quick little thing and it should be abundantly obvious the number one thing you should really set out to do whenever you make a product is when i first and this is just a general business tip when i started hiros for six months i didn't make any money okay all i did was lose money because i knew that in order for people to believe in hirose and start believing in our tracking there had to be results and so for months and months and months i got people on for free and i proved that the system worked is this is this good for making money fast no but and also there's nothing wrong with making money fast and going for cash flow there's two different goals my goal at high risk is not the cash flow super quickly that being said your number one objective when it comes to making a business should be getting people results because that's what actually gets your copy writing to work the reason why this this video works so well is because of all the results and proof that i have so the number one tip i have for you in copywriting is actually make the product good and make it achieve the desired result the person's getting because if you can do that then it's going the copywriting is going to be a million times easier and that should be very clear if you sell something that works it's easier to sell most people don't don't get that okay most products don't really achieve what people are promising make sure it does that and then get lots of proof that it does and then what you're going to be able to do is all the words and skepticism is going to be knocked out what i did there is i said i know you're skeptical here's proof that you're not skeptical and here's more proof and when they're skeptical in the future they're going to come back to that that little pattern i just did if you even have any more doubts you can see all these six seven eight and even nine figure brands below this video and in this video that have used tires to significantly grow their ads much further save a ton of money so this first minute and 30 seconds you need to take away the most powerful sales tactic in the history of anything if you can sit what people sign up for things for is results if you can just actually come out and say and this this usually only applies in b2b usually when you're doing b2c you have to convince people that they want the results okay and that's a little bit longer of a process that's why b2c videos that's why if you see make money online webinars they're so damn long because usually you have to convince the person even that they want to make money online okay and the same thing with fitness and other stuff like that when a person is watching this video they already have one goal that they want to make more money from ads so if i can just say i know what you want this is what you're looking for i'm going to deliver that and if i can just convince them that i can 100 do that they're going to sign up okay especially when i remove the risk at the end of this video and get customers much cheaper because the ai on their ad platforms is more optimized because it's using high-risk print tracking data and if that wasn't enough we guarantee those results because at high risk we have a 90-day happiness-based guarantee meaning if people don't see those results that i just talked about they don't pay so first and foremost this is real this is working and people that you know who are running ads are running this right now so in this first two minutes i achieved something very powerful i proved that everything i'm saying is true that's a great pause i look like a rodent uh anyways uh i can i convinced them that this is true whether they whether they want to sign up for a high risk or not everything i'm saying right here is true they can decide whether tracking and improving their ads and optimizing them and making more money from them are important to them enough but there's no doubt there's no debate whether hyrus works or not at this point in time and so i'm in a very powerful position where everything i say after this is going to be taken in in a much more trustworthy fashion there's not going to be there's not going to be a skepticism wall and the number one thing that stops b2b sales is a skepticism wall okay same thing with b2c but the thing that stops b to c sales is not only skepticism but the desire to actually solve the problem that you want them to solve and b2b usually they know what the problem is they want to solve it and if you can show them just clear-cut ways that they can make more money with your product you're going to crush it that's why i love b2b because for example if i call up an office and i say look i can put this little device in your phones it's going to allow your closers to close five percent more that'll make you a hundred thousand more dollars a year give me ten thousand dollars for it and here's a billion examples that it works you're going to be making ten thousand dollar sales left and right that's the type of product i love to design and look if that's enough for you and you just want to hop on a call and we'll show you exactly how this works and how it will apply to your business you can just go below and click one of the setup buttons that is on this page there's one right so here's something i do that's way different than any other sales call funnel i go for the phone call in the first two minutes nobody does this maybe someone does does it i don't think i'm the first person to go for it but what i what i know in which you should think about when you're running a sales video is the context of who you're talking to a person watching this if they're a qualified customer for hiros they don't have a lot of time they they have a position somewhere they're either buying media or the ceo of a company so i just say like look these are the results we get it's true it works and there's absolutely no risk to signing up and i have no benefit to sell you something that doesn't work because then you'll just refund and then we won't we like it's just a waste of time for everybody so if that's good enough for you and you just want the results just book a call this this kills it our costs we're called plummeted below this video you book a free demo with us we walk you through how the entire software works and we'll even set this up for you so if that's all you need just go book a call with us right now we'll set it up just like all the businesses you've seen on this page and all those big brands now if you want to see how this works and why this works that's what i'm going to explain to you in the rest of the video so i want to point out one thing here that's very very powerful that it's you're not going to notice because the intention is for you not to notice it you're going to never see me saying um are all right or yeah or filling in the blanks in my speech this is super important when you're talking to people because when you're saying um the reason why people say um or fill in the blanks in their speech is because they're insecure i'm not saying you're insecure and you're like a little baby if you do this everybody does this but the reason why you do it is you believe subconsciously that if you stop making noise you're going to lose attention people that are powerful talk like i'm talking right now they're very comfortable not speaking and i'm not doing this intentionally right now with the pauses i'm thinking about what i'm going to say next they're comfortable with silence and really making sure what they say is the exact thing that they're going to say so when you're going and speaking and making sales videos you need to one if you just understand that thought that you're making those noises because you're afraid that people won't listen to you it will help a lot but two what i suggest doing is whenever you say um or you say one of these things that you say all the time you have to say the f word afterwards you're going to stop saying it really quickly because you're just going to say um f okay and i'm not i'm not cussing because of the youtube algorithm and so it's going to make you not able to communicate and so you're going to stop saying um very quickly you have to get good at being silent because it really it it gets you more attention than talking quickly and saying um a lot i used to do it all the time i used to say all right like after at the end of every sentence i was i was like a pokemon with a catchphrase now you probably value your time just like me so i'm going to give you an overview in this video i'm going to go through it pretty quickly and give you the quick version of why this works however if you want the hyper detailed versions of this there's videos on how you can scale how you can save money and how we use ai and even how our tech works below this video so that's a quick little thing i like to do on sales call pages that also nobody else does so when people come to a sales call page usually your sales video is meant for everybody and that's really bad because you're not really going to address anyone's specific concern you're going to be you're going to be speaking to tons of people at the same time what i like to do is i like to make the video very short and to the point and just basically show the benefits and then give them other videos based on the problems they might actually be more interested in and show exactly how i fix that problem so if you go to this page itself by the way like you can go sign up for hiros below you can also go look at my consulting youtube coaching program which actually is like what i'm doing right now times 10. okay multiple businesses that have signed up for that across six to seven figures just by applying my copywriting techniques and connecting it to youtube but what you're going to see on those same those pages which you can go look at afterwards is you're going to see that i provide people not so much in the iron one the consulting one but on the highest one i give them multiple other videos so they can kind of pick their poison they can pick who how they're being sold to so for example a person that's really interested in saving money on their ads there's a money just there's a video just for them a person that's interested in ai optimization of their ads there's a video just for them and so i tell them hey you don't need to watch this video what you could actually do is just skip to the prom you're actually having and i'll tell you all about how to fix that it's extremely powerful on this page yeah so i'm more than happy to go into more detail with you but let me tell you why hirose works so well and how people are able to scale much further save money on their ads and get customers much cheaper with ai because i know so far this probably sounds like buzzwords but it's actually not that complicated it's not that sexy it's actually quite simple let me explain first off my name is oxbecker okay so you can see that i really just laid on the benefits and what i'm saying is true in the beginning of the video there's no point in me introducing myself or showing them things until they know it's true now what my goal is right here is you're going to notice the way that i explain hirose and what it does is extremely simple i could go into the layers of tracking we have and the tech behind it that we've been developing for literally years where i can get into why technically it's better than facebook tracking you could just look at the results but people you need to understand that when you're selling your goal is not to teach people things and that's not in a negative way if you teach someone something like i'm teaching you right now you're probably feeling a little bit confused and overwhelmed that's a sign that you're learning discomfort is a science you're learning that's not a good place for a person to be when they want to buy what you want to do when you're selling something is you want to explain it in a way where the goal is easy understanding and comfortableness with the idea you don't want deep understanding you want an understanding of the core concept because before people buy something first they need to understand that it's true but what they also need to deeply deeply feel is that they get it okay for the reason the reason why people don't buy bitcoin in the big shift between a person buying bitcoin and not buying bitcoin is they get it once a person gets bitcoin they buy tons of it and they don't need to understand no one really understands the deep ways that bitcoin works i understand it pretty well but even i don't okay and i've made a ton of money on bitcoin what you want to do when you're explaining something is you don't go deep into it you need to explain why what people need to know before they buy is they need to have a why if people have a why behind their actions then they can do them much easier people don't just do actions they have to always justify so what i'm about to do here is explain why they should listen to me okay that's why that's why you introduce yourself you don't introduce yourself just so people get to know you you introduce yourself so people know why they should listen to you and then i'm gonna explain hyrus in very simple ways extremely quick easy ways because the person watching this doesn't care about the deep things more importantly if i explain the deep things they'll get confused if they're in a state of confusion they won't book a call i want them to be in a state of comfort and easy understanding so i'm going to keep everything very very simple and that's how you should always sell never go deep into it you can do the deep stuff maybe on the phone call i'm the ceo of hiros and over the course of my career i've grown multiple businesses to seven and eight figures purely using ads i've spent tens of millions of career and frankly there was always one problem that stopped me from growing my businesses it always stopped me from scaling to the next level you can see what i'm doing right here is i introduce myself but i'm also telling a story the reason why you want to tell stories is because you can't tell people certain things you can't make people understand something by telling them to understand it what you need to do is you tell a story that a person can relate to and when you tell a story the person's thinking about themselves i'm telling the story my story which is actually true unlike other sales videos most people tell a story where they came out of a dumpster and then got chased by a bear and that's how they put on 50 pounds of muscle in this story i'm telling them a problem uh that i had and describing the problem and it's a problem that i know they have as well and so this is how we build the connection and they start to understand what hirose does and what it solves so i just said you know hyrus gonna solve that tracking problem you got they're gonna think oh you know tracking if i say man you know this is the problem i had and here's how it affected me and it was just terrible and you know it used to come to my house and pull my pants down at parties they're gonna be like you know i i've felt that same exact way and then when i present the solution and go oh now i understand the solution to how i'm feeling you have to inceptionalize people you can't tell people anything you have to get people to come to the conclusions on their own in their head and that's why stories are so impactful it also wasted hundreds of thousands actually millions of dollars worth of ad spent over my career and it kind of makes me sick to talk about it but i did finally fix this in fact i invested tens of thousands of dollars up front to develop something like hyrus to fix this problem and it was the best investment i ever made because it fixed this problem here's what the problem is add platform tracking data the results and attribution of your sales meaning if you spend one dollar in reports on the sales that were created by that one ad spend it's not accurate you've probably already noticed this and if you're wondering why that's the case there's a video that breaks down all the technical details of ad platform so you can see i did something pretty clever here i'm not going to i did something okay here i hate complimenting myself all right so there are going to be people that watch this so they're technical freaks we get a few of those at high roast that's fine i want them to go somewhere else and sell themselves on their technical stuff so all the technical stuff is actually below this video they can go and actually check that out i'm not going to do that here because it's going to scare away 90 of people but i'm like hey man you know if you're one of the people that has these thoughts going on your head here's a video just for you go scoot over there and then these people will go do that but i but i don't want them or what i want these people also to do here's another thing you want to understand if you say i'll get to it later it's almost as good as solving the problem now this can be used in very misleading ways but if you address what a person's saying like hey i know you're probably thinking what's the technical stuff behind this i completely understand that but that would take me 20 minutes to explain i have it fully answered below for you most people just accept that and they never read the technical stuff okay i'm laughing about it because this is just what i do as well that's what everybody does if you if you address what a person's thinking and then say look i'll solve that later they'll put that problem away most of the time not always but most of the time and so what you want to do with problems that prevent a sale and just take way too much explaining and detract from the overall goal of what you're going to because i want to wrap this up in about seven minutes okay you can see about nine minutes where i really start hammering down the call i want to get through this as fast as possible get to the thing that's actually going to make them buy me talking about the technicals behind it isn't going to make them buy so i graze over it while addressing the problem i'm tracking versus high-risk tracking here's the short of it ad platform tracking is only working with one data point that click from the ad and then what also happens is on mobile phones and on desktop browsers their tracking is constantly being wiped people are changing their devices and long story short it's hard to get an accurate reading of what ad generated what sale or even catch most of the sales coming in in fact when i look at most user sales on average most people are missing 30 to 50 percent of their attributed sales from their ad platforms and long story short this causes inaccurate data for example look at this so look at this it's going to make it clear as day i'm displaying all my hieros tracking results inside of all right so i'm going to kind of skim through the videos of me going through hiros okay but what you're going to see in this is i basically go and i know what my customers i've i presented i've i've convinced a person that what i'm saying is true i've made them understand the problem that they have and that i've that i had the problem too and i've made them go okay i get the problem so now that you're going okay i have this problem too that this the same guy has and this same guy fixed it what i'm gonna do now when i show the demo is i i need to understand the three things the customer is most interested in and what i show them is me fixing these three things so when i brought this problem what most people are thinking about and i i this video is based on me just watching hiros customers and watching them talk is they care about making more money on their ads they care about not wasting money on their ads and they care about their ads being more effective in getting customers cheaper that's solved at highrose the first two easily so i demonstrate that i show in this first one right here all right here's me literally going and missing tons of money making opportunities because i didn't see the sales on the net i had one ad that was putting out a 500 roi and i didn't invest in it because i couldn't see the sales coming in then i show them the next problem they have okay here's how you save money look at all these ads i spent money on it didn't actually generate an roi but i spent money on them because i couldn't see all my sales coming in and they sometimes worked they sometimes didn't so i assumed sales was coming from them i also go and total this up i want i want to not show what i'm doing right here but i want to explain what i do is i total up how much money they can gain and they can and they are losing okay so for example if they if they're spending 100 thousand a month on ads i show them hey look if you see the correct data coming in you'll easily be able to make an extra 20 on ads that's an extra 20 000 a month and people do this all the time what i'm doing right here i want to stress that you can use exactly what i'm doing here to blow smoke up people's butts i want to stress what i'm doing here at hiros is i'm showing people the low ends i've seen people double triple their business when they come to the house but i'm not going to tell people that you really don't want to work with crazy results like that either because then what happens is people think you're crazy if i just put out something very reasonable and i do i do basic math you're doing you're spending 100 000 a month on ads to do a 2x ry so look if you see the right sales data coming in you can start investing more and the right ads easily increase your business by 15 to 20 percent now look at all that money i waste on here i'm spending 6 000 a day and i'm wasting 2 000 a day of it you can see it right here and then i show proof of me turning off all the bad ads and then making the same amount so i just took 60 000 a month or actually yeah 60 000 a month in savings just by turning these ads off with your business spending 100 000 a month that's an easy extra 10 to 20 000 a month and then finally if you plug this all in the ai and you find the right customers that's easily going to reduce your cost per customer 10 to 15 that's another 15 to 20 000 a month and when i'm on a sales call with people and when i'm doing this video i break down these numbers because these numbers aren't unreasonable if you move the needle in a few directions with ads this is what happens so what i do in this video is i break that down i see look if you have 1 000 per month business let's take away that 60 000 a month extra you make let's just take it down to 20 000. reasonable low end that's an extra two hundred thousand dollars a year saved and gained in your pocket combined do you want that two hundred thousand dollars yeah you do so why don't you book a call and we'll show you how to get that and then hi-ros is a fraction of that if you sign up for hirose spending a hundred thousand a month it's gonna cost you one percent of that extra money that you made that's the after i prove what i'm saying is true once i've identified the problem the person's having then once i prove it can be fixed and i use the math behind it to justify it i am hitting them emotionally because they're afraid of loss and not not getting what they want and also logically at the same time and this is where the pitch hits this is where the pitch hits because it's just like i put i push put if it's a hundred thousand a month uh ad spend business i just put 200 000 extra year on the table i said do you want it i go yeah and i go good because if you sign up for i actually go for the call again midway once i've made this point it becomes very obvious what i'm doing about seven minutes in i put the 200 000 on the table okay and i said do you want it and they say yeah i say good because i guarantee you're gonna get that or you don't pay for hiros and they go what that's that's what i do at this point right here i'm not really gonna you can go and actually watch the rest of this video if you click the page below but what i do for the rest of the video after i prove the point and show it being solved with hiros is the entire pitch is look there's 200 000 on the table hyrus has a 90 day refund guarantee if you aren't happy you don't even even if you see results if you're not happy you don't pay for it here's hundreds of here's not hundreds below this but there are hundreds of people on high risk who've gotten these results here's a countless amount of people people you know big brands that are saying this is true as well so why don't you hop on a call and worst case scenario we get on the call and we look at your tracking and we we help you out we point out where you might be having gaps but more importantly on the call you're not going to be closed you're not going to be hard closed because frankly if we can't get you results and we don't believe we can help you there's no point for us to sell to you because then you're going to refund and we're going to waste all our time teams time so let's take a look at your business let's find out where the gaps are and you're losing money and then let's make you that extra 200 000 and if you don't make it you don't pay for it how does that sound i'm selling a person a hundred dollar bill for twenty dollars and also that twenty dollars is risk free a person that wants to make more money from their ads which is the target customer of this video and you're gonna see me do this for the rest of the video i'm just going to start breaking down math of how much money they're losing how much money they could gain and then showing them basically like you're just a goof troop like you could make an extra 10 this year just hopping on a call and letting us plug hyrus in for you that's the position you want people to be in where it is completely illogical and goofy for them not to take you up on it it'd be like dude there's 200 000 on the table are you going to walk around walk across the room pick it up we will carry you to the 200 000 if you want and if for some reason you can't pick it up it's too heavy or something you don't lose anything you could just sit here and spread out sprawl out and just say yes we'll pick you up we'll take you to it why would you not take us up on that that's how if you look at the end of your pitch and you can't think man it would be illogical it'd be insane for someone not to hop on a call if they if they're a target customer insane it'd be pointless why would you not then you're in a good place if you can't say that that's when you're going to have trouble that's when you're going to have trouble this is a breakdown of the sales video i only want to do this first because what you're going to see at the end of the sales video is kind of a closing pattern and if you guys if enough people post yes below i'll make a video on the closing pattern okay enough people comment and put yes below if we get 200 yeses because this channel doesn't get as many views as my other channel i'll make the closing video okay but you can also just go watch this video i'll actually just add the rest of this video to this video so you can watch the rest of it and then i'll do a breakdown the closing pattern if you guys want me to that being said guys this has been alex becker i'm going to leave the video right now i'll let you watch the rest of it because the closing pattern right here is something you can easily recreate it's it's very simple okay you can just watch it and just do exactly what i'm doing right here the magic is this that also being said look if if what i described here with high risk tracking you you you relate to that why don't you come book a call for hires below and we we can make you that extra money like it's we guarantee it we literally guarantee it also if you want help with your ads and you want actual coaching on me you want me to you want to go through and see everything i'm doing my businesses from the ads the copywriting of the ads how i run them how i bid and buy the ads how i make videos like this generate an extra 20 30 000 per day uh for my business go and also sign up for a consulting call with me below we'll we'll talk about exactly how you can go and get your ads on youtube all the copyright behind it how you can scale your ads on facebook as well everything and if you go and click that video below you'll see just like i talked about i endless amount of results of people have gone six and seven figure results so that being said this has been alex i hope you enjoy the rest of the video chill man take it easy i'll see you around this means literally that you're going to turn off ads that are actually generating you a lot of profit you just can't see the profit coming in you're going to go and invest money in ads that are actually not generating you profit through false reporting of sales that didn't actually happen or just not being sure of what ads you can turn off and then finally you're going to take all this data and you're going to feed this back to your ad platform ai like you are already doing and this is going to give your ad platform ai bad data when an ai gets bad data it is not as accurate as it could be and because of that it's going to use this bad data and become less efficient at finding new customers and when an ai is less efficient at finding new customers it costs more to acquire a customer because because the targeting is not accurate it's not as on point as it needs to be and to put it in the most simple way possible that is exactly what hirose fixes it takes all those problems puts them in a box and smashes them with a hammer and says you never have to deal with this ever again because what it does is it uses print tracking to give you the highest level of ad attribution possible when you see this this means you're working with correct data and when you have correct data you're going to make correct ad buying decisions this means you're going to spot the ads that are actually making you money and keep investing on them thus increase your scale you're going to clearly see the ads that are wasting your money and turn them off thus eliminating waste and you're going to pass this data back from hyrus and our print tracking system into your ad platform ii's on the ad platforms you're using which are the big ones and this will make your ais better and allow you to get customers cheaper and this is all done without you making any changes in your business in fact it takes a couple minutes to set up if you're new to it it takes seconds if you know what you're doing and by the way our entire staff of analysts knows what they're doing and they'll help you set this up literally same day you could have it done literally after this video if you book a call with us today and when people poke a call with us and have us set up hirus with them you've seen the results all over the page you've seen the big brands doing this and the reason why you see so many people hopping on hyrus the reason why we can guarantee these results with our 90-day guarantee is because on the low end the average user that comes and completes setup with iris is able to scale at least 20 percent further on the low end they're able to save at least 15 of their ad spend and once you have the data coming in the ai becomes more efficient by default and that is such a huge advantage when it comes to buying ads and is so much more roi and revenue in your pocket think about it take how much money you spend every single year in ads and then also think about the standard roi even on a low end business it's only spending a hundred thousand a year on ads at a 2x roi the savings and gain is immense at that 2x roi if you're able to scale just 20 percent further that's 40 000 in extra revenue they're going to make per year and with the savings of 15 that's an extra 15 000 per year put back in the businesses pocket as pure profit because it's not being spent on ad spend anymore without any losses and sales and then when you go and cut the cost to acquire a customer from the ads by using this data with ai i'm not even going to give you any more numbers i don't want to hype this up anymore i think you can look at the potential right there and that's potential again that we guarantee that's potential that so many other people that you've already seen on this page and we can show
