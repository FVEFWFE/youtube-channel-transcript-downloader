[Music] hey you cool email marketer you what's going on this is Becker CEO of Market hero again and what we're going to be getting to in this video uh something that's very important and a lot of people Overlook and that's how to bring a lead onto your list to make sure they stay on your list for a long time look you bring people in from ads and if you're able to get them to adopt and hop on your list and open your emails and actually become a commended customer that person's going to be buying from you for years and that increases your value of a person that jumps on your email list from maybe 16 to $50 to $60 and outrageous stuff because these people eventually buy everything you're sell so I'm going be talking to you right now about how to bring on a lead turn them into a fan that consistently buys from you without you even needing a sales page so we're going to hop into that right now in the market here blog and uh that's all there is to it so let's do it okay guys so we're inside Market hero and if you want to go create a free TR blow and follow along um I think you should because what I'm about to show you another other system on the planet can do and this one little step right here is going to be why everything in this video is going to generate you or 2x or 3x your business if you go and apply it because nobody does this nobody tracks this and this is why nobody thinks like I'm about to show you how to think so you can see right here if we just type in one tag of people that came on uh to my email list right here it's about $83 people I paid about $6 per lead and on average I made about $26 back long-term value from the people that came on this list now like always in every video we're going to focus on getting the long-term value the amount on average every lead pays for on a list to absurdly high numbers because because when we have this I'm paying $6 lead I can keep scaling my business to the Moon okay and you're going to see how to do this in this video and the real key to this and the real three factors that go into this equation are the length of time you can get people to stay on your list the amount of opens clicks and uh interactions with your business every time they open and click an email that's a new time to be sold to and the amount they buy and the thing I'm going to show you the simple stuff I'm going to show you in this video increases all of those things to the point where you get a massive Roi Pro lead in fact I'm going to show you how if you get one lead out of a thousand people to become a longtime List member they can pay for a, leads four times over okay so the whole key to this and the whole point of this video is to get people to stay in your list for the longest amount of time possible and open and click and interact and like your business as much as possible and there's a really simple trick to doing this but you need to understand three rules before we get into this the first thing you need to understand is there's no such thing as buyers if you've been in internet marketing for any amount of time people are going to tell you there's free B Chasers and then there's buyers and if you can get an email list for people that have bought something from you they're going to buy 10 times more but you don't want freebie chasers on your list and this just isn't true whenever you run an opt-in online whenever people opt into your blog they haven't bought from you yet they're after whatever free bait or whatever thing you're offering to join your email list now look almost 95% of people that join your email list have a credit card almost 98% of people that have joined your email list have bought something online there's no such thing as a person that that is not an online buyer in this day and age especially if they're opting in this stuff the problem is they don't have enough trust and Rapport and positive expectation to buy from you they are buying stuff everywhere they're just not buying from you what we need to do is convert them into buyers into people that trust us the difference between a freebie Chase and a buyer is a buyer has already interacted with your brand they've already bought something from you they gone to know you and they have hopefully positive expectations to buy more from you that's the only difference they've had time to build trust and Report I'm sure you've opted into email us before where person starts trying to sell you right away and you know what happens you never open their emails you never do anything with that business again because you don't know what the freck they're about all you know is that they're just trying to get money out of you that's why a lot of freebie Chasers become very worthless leads now the next thing you need to understand is the best sales tactic is positive expectations if you go into the Apple Store there's not a zero there's no copywriting in the entire store there isn't like big signs that say it does this this and that and the features it's actually in very small text next to the computers if you look at any businesses online that are killing it the reason they're so successful is not because they have amazing copyright people focus on selling and copyrighting and all sorts of stuff out there that's not it okay the thing is their customers have positive expectations they know if they buy something from the person it's going to work it's going to be good okay so you need understand when we ingrain positive expectations of people we don't even need copyrighting for example I launched a online university we had a a very very weak sales page and we grew the business to a believe $40,000 a month reoccurring income reoccurring income uh with this very weak sales page just by saying hey guys we're opening up something new it's going to be great uh we can only let 300 people in boom sold out literally in minutes okay so we have to ingrain these positive expectations so people buy without needing to be sold to this is huge now the next thing you need to understand also the positive expectations before we hop to the next part is that if people have positive expectations they're going to click open and stay on your list for a very long time now the final thing you need to understand is it only takes one long-term buyer okay and we're going to be creating many more than just one long-term buyer out of a thousand but it only takes one person out of a th who absolutely loves you to pay for an entire list of leads okay so for example say we get a th000 optin at $3 a pop that's kind of the average-ish you can get on Facebook and other sources that will cost us $3,000 now look there are people just like this on my list that been on my list since 2013 okay um there's people on my list in the past year that have done this we have multiple people that will come on my list and just one person buys a $1,200 per year software we have for example a software called Source machine it's $99 per month that's $1,200 per year we have people that have been on it for almost a year now okay then another person or the same person goes and buys a $2,000 per year service we have another service that is $200 a month okay that's about $2,400 a year let's just round it down to 2,000 boom just right there that one person is paid for that list of a th000 leads now here's the kicker every once in now again I'll pitch a program that's $5,000 or $8,000 uh through one of my Affiliates or or someone out there now um these are very high prices and I make sure these programs are amazing and get results that being said that being said I have multiple people on my list have done this exact thing this exact thing and this one person has paid for a thousand leads off of Facebook that's absolutely huge and so what we need to really focus on is not selling up front not going and getting the best C and being as salesy as possible what we want to do is we want to create as many of these people as we possibly can if we have two to three of these people per thousand we are killing it we're smoking it and the business explodes that's why right here I want to show you this if you go into Market hero and then we go down to my uni ad funnel right here this is just a simple ad we got about 31 leads into it okay by the end of the funnel they make me about $484 that's pretty good if you're paying about $4 per lead I just created a list of 31 people um essentially for free from Facebook so I'm paying about four bucks per lead in this Niche right here but here's the kicker all right the pro the people and all the trust I built from this list uh it doesn't end when they get to the end of the the stream the end of the funnel right here and what you're going to see happening right here is we go right here and we look and that person gets tagged with uni funnel right here when they went through um what you're going to see and this is it's usually not going to be this consistent the conversions are not going to be this crazy but you can see right here we got about 30 contacts on here okay and two of these contacts right here bought I believe one of them bought the Hero Academy uh from Market her right here and another one went through and bought a multiple thousand course and so just these 31 people right here on average I generated $54 per lead all right you can see how valuable just two people in this everybody else in the list hasn't even bought anything okay these people might be be dead leads but you can see when they come through on the list how valuable they are if you can go and build those positive expectations if you can build that amount of trust you only need one or two people to do this so let's get into how to do this now step one and you can try to do this with other tracking if you want you need to go inside of Market hero and you need to go and create your tracking pixels this is how we're going to track what people are buying from us in the first month the first six months the first year the first two years the first three years and this is how we go and calculate that LTV okay that's so important that's so incredibly important if you can't track this you're not going to see the benefits of doing what I'm about to tell you but once you track this it becomes so comically easy to grow your list in leads because you see exactly how much every single one is worth to you so what happens next is I this is a basic option I've ran forever okay I've been running this forever because it's just so profitable I showed you exactly how much people are worth to me when they come on my list okay so I do something a little bit differently than other people when leads opt in all right so I'm just going to enter this email right here so you don't understand when most people op to an email list the first thing everyone's going to tell you to do is sell sell sell right away to make up the cost for leads you can do that that works it'll make you break even but here's what it's going to cut you cut your earnings in half over the long term because what happens when you sell to somebody right away is they don't get to know your business they don't have a chance to become in their mind a buyer they don't know who you are when you email them they don't they don't know if you have their their best interest in mind they don't know anything about you okay so there's no chance to build any positive expectations but here's what I do okay and I'll actually link to this video um in a call out annotation on YouTube when you're watching this video be sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel as well it's it's groovy um that being said in this video right here what I do is I introduce myself as Alex Becker I say hey look everything you just opted in for is right here at the bottom of the page you're going to get everything we're not even going to try and sell you we're not you can see right here I say this is not a sales video because I want them to listen up I say look my name is Alex Becker I'm the CEO of source wave we help tons of people get SEO results we're going to be sending you a ton of 100% free training that is awesome it's going to help you out so much and on top of that what you just opt for we're not only going to give that to you we're going to deliver 10 times that we're going to give you a free train that shows you how to go out there and make money with it to build it around your business whatever you want to do with it on top of what you just opted in for so what did I just create here one the person knows who I am so when they get an email from Source wve they know hey that's that cool guy who gives me cool stuff two when they see an email from Source they go hey it's probably that training and extra cool stuff you told me about three I overd deliver right here without being salesy or pushy and what happens is that creates positive expectation the result is people are open my emails they're clicking my emails and when I eventually sell to them guess what they're going to have give me money it's probably going to be something good because right here they gave me their email and something good happened okay so they go through and they get the training next thing happens they see one of my emails they click on it they get more training and something better happens they get they get even more training and more free cool stuff and then I send another email with more free value and training more positive expectations are built and then I pitched them then I pitched to them at that point in time and that's how I get really really high conversions with very simple sales Pages you can see for example right here here's one of our sales pages right here for Source University okay extremely extremely extremely simple and all you can see is I just put testimonials right here there's almost there's almost no copy on this page at all this thing converts like crazy when I mail people from my email list that's it and I have a sales video right here that's it it's very very simple and so that's how I get people to convert really highly now I want to show you the funnel behind this right here here's the exact funnel that people are opting in from uh when they come in so let's zoom in a sec and I'm going to show this to you um so when we go in here we look at the funnel right here you can see from the actually this email right here every single person we've generated almost $4,000 just from that welcome video remember that first welcome video where I didn't sell anything at the end of the first training what I do is I simply link to Source University and say hey if you want to hop in on this uh here's a crazy discount if you like this training that you just got you're probably going to like a load more and you can see right here we've generated a ton from it we have a 55% open rate on this email 36% click-through rate because of the the positive expectations that I create okay so as we keep going down the funnel what we do is we just keep sending people more training you can see from this email right here a 35% open rate absolutely huge because of positive expectations and what's in this email right here you can see I'm generated $2,000 from this email right here and this is just a value email I'm making money simply sending out valuable information so if we go right here and we just look at the email what's happening right here I'm just sending them training I'm just sending them training in the simplest email format right here and so when they go through and they click on this we go right here and we teach them something cool and so you can see how you can see how this blows up my cost my my long-term value per lead because people trust me and at the very end of this funnel right here guess what happens you know they go through the funnel and then maybe that's when I'm going to pitch them that $5,000 product that's when I'm pitch them that $88,000 product now is every going to buy that no maybe one two or three people out of a thousand will buy that but but because of that guys that they pay for everything that's how I get that massive long-term value and the only way you can do that is by creating that positive expectation and trying to convert every single person that comes onto your list into a buyer when you try and sell up front and you get a 3 5% conversion rate after the optin 5% of people become long-term customers when you do this 50 70% 80% I don't know the exact metric become long-term customers they come people that trust you and they become those one or three people maybe they didn't buy upfront but they become one of those three people that buys that $5,000 product from you so that is why this is so damn important that is why this is why this is the best way to sell and this is why the best this is the best way to make that 8X 10x eventually after two years you know maybe 20x Roi and every single lead that comes onto your email list it's huge it's huge so that being said this is the lesson for today remember create positive expectations to keep people on your list longer and then Focus on creating making every single freebie Chaser that jumps on your list a buyer and then remember it only takes one two or three people to pay for a th000 leads remember that so this has been Becker again there's a free trial of Market hero below if you want to do all the marketing all the stuff I just showed you in this video
