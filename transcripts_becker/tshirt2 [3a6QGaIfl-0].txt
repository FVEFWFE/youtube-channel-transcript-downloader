[Music] okay guys what's up welcome to the second video I'm glad you're still here you're getting closer to that t-shirt by the minute better be getting excited so what we're going to talk about right now is importing leads and again like the previous videos you don't need to go do this now but I want you to understand exactly how it works it's a real simple process so if you have leads from another autoresponder you're coming from another autoresponder cuz ours is much better uh what you're going to want to do is probably import those leads uh and then start start using this system to bring in new leads but you want to start off with the leads you already have so you can send them emails now it's really easy to do and really easy to actually segment people and determine which leads do what and if you have current segments you can do that as well so what we're going to do now is import a list of dummy leads into the system so what we're going to need first is just a CSV filed very basic right here with the list of the emails if you just want to import those you can also use a different column for the name and last name of the emails if you're into that kind of thing I usually just import the emails so you're going to go up here and you're going to click import you're go browse files and what you're going to do is go find that file right here so here's my file boom putting that in and it's going to go and begin the import process now here's what you need to know while we're getting into that the first thing you're going to see it pops up and it's going to say after your leads are imported we will verify the information wait until we approve your leads and then you will see them in your lead panel so what you need to do right here is you want to go to the column and mark the columns as what they are so only only had one column so I'm going to mark it as email the second column is names the second or the third column is last name you can do that as well now I want everybody who comes into this to be tagged with the tag new lead okay so if I have other leads in my system and I want to differentiate these leads between another one I can tag them like this on top of when a person comes in the system they're naturally get tagged at the time when they're import so if you forget to add a tag you forget anything you know like that you can go back and always find out exactly who you imported when wear so you can retag them and res segment them now what you're going to need to do now that's optional but it will greatly speed up the process is you're going to need us to give us your previous mailing platform your username and temporary password now why do we do this we're not going into the mess with your your emails steal your emails or anything like that what we're going in there to do is to confirm that the list that you're sending us is actually your list uh we don't want to lot of people coming in here uploading list of people that don't belong them have not opted into their businesses and then blasting them with that that's going to hurt our deliverability it's going to hurt your deliverability and we also want to help you make sure that you're importing the list the right way for example when you're importing list you want to make sure to remove all your unsubscribes remove anyone that's complained you can find all these easily in any autoresponder you've been using now once you have that you want to go and grab the list you want to import it like I have right now put in your previous mailing platform uh put in a username I'm just going to put fake and I'm for password I'm put fake but give us a temporary password temporary username again we are legally bound not to touch it anything we're just going in to make sure the past emails you've sent out have a positive complaint ratio okay as in you're not getting more than one complaint per th emails you can also go and put in your phone number if you want and we can give you a call if you want to confirm that way now this part right here is optional you don't have to do it however if you do not fill out this information right here uh our staff is going to contact you through this little chat box down here eventually it's going to pop up and say hey we're looking at your leads right now and they're going to need things like a screenshot or proof that these leads are yours before we let you go out there and start mailing out the system this is to protect everybody's deliverability in the system and make sure that your deliverability stays topnotch and we're not going to be letting in any turds you could hurt your deliverability um or or anything like that so you're going to mark this I've read and agreed to the terms of service and then you're going to hit import what's going to happen is they're all going to be imported into the system we're going to prove it and then probably within a few hours you're going to see all the leads in here ready to be mailed now in a lot of systems they don't even let you import leads okay without a phone call and in-depth stuff or they'll mess with your leads and run like a a slow mail out that is is not a good representative or they just will just do all sorts of things to mess with you this is the quickest way to get all your leads in the system and get you working inside the system as fast as possible so work with us on this again we're not going to be digging around your crown or doing anything we're just confirming your leads are actually yours and in getting them to you as fast as possible so you can legally go out there and email everyone on there our goal is to mess with you the very least so that's what we got going on right here in the next video we're going to talk about how to go out there and set up your off opin in your funnels so that you can do all sorts of other cool stuff like automate your email marketing track how well your funnels are doing other stuff like that so it's been Becker I'll see you in the next video
