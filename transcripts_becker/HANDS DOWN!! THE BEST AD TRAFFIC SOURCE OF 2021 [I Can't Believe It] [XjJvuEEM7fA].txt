================================================================================

this is by far going to be the best traffic source for you in 2021 hands down everybody who does what i'm gonna tell you in this video makes significantly more money i'm not exaggerating this is not hyperbole i i could literally show you hundreds of testimonials of people doing this and making significantly more money from this traffic source if you understand what i'm going to show you in this video and you apply this to your ads i this is how i've generated multiple eight figures in sales at my info business this is how i've scaled iros to being the fastest growing ad tracking company in the world right now if you just use this traffic source and this type of mindset towards this traffic source you're gonna kill it now let's back up okay you're like whoa tai lopez calm down with those income claims okay i know everybody all the time is like this is the best traffic source that's ever just oh i get it i get it but what i'm gonna show you in this video is back by data it's backed by results and i've tested this multiple multiple multiple multiple times and it just consistently works and i have absolutely no incentive to show you this other than the fact that i need you to make more money from your ads because if you make more money from your ads you're going to pick up hi-ros because ad tracking is absolutely essential especially after the ios updates so unlike everybody else who tells you this is the best traffic source ever i actually am going to show you the best traffic source ever so that you will make more money and then you can actually run in the tracking issues and then buy my product and the only way you're going to do that is if i actually give you the best traffic source and you're able to go and get the results i just got done talking about so instead of hyping this up and talking anymore and showing you cool little like thumb is how do you i got your nose tricks impress you i'm just gonna get right into it let's go okay guys so what i want you to understand in this video is this is how you find the absolute best traffic source this is how you define what's going to be the best traffic source for you in 2021 and then in this video i'll actually tell you what i believe is the best traffic source but you need to understand this first if you understand this you are going to make an absolute killing every person i know that does this makes an absolute killing i have made an absolute killing doing this here's what you need to understand so when you're working on an ad source what you need to understand is the way that you actually make a killing with an ad source is through feedback loops okay and so in order to set up a proper funnel a proper ad campaign what do you need to do well you're going to need to make let's just say for the hi-ros funnel okay i'm going to need to make an opt-in page i'm going to need to make a sales video page and then i'm going to have to have all the call booking and whatnot where the people go on the phone and close the more important thing going on here is going to be the ad the opt-in and the sales video and depending on the traffic source people can behave super differently so for example when i was running hcom which was an info offer i scaled up on youtube to eight figures actually multiple eight figures in sales uh gross the people who came from youtube behaved super differently than people that came from facebook now there's all sorts of theories on why that might be for example a person on facebook is scrolling on their app while they're in line at the grocery store a person on youtube is sitting down and watching something so they're much more inclined to watch a sales video or a webinar presentation but just knowing that know that traffic sources people are going to behave differently because they're using them at different times and for different reasons and they're in different states so when you're writing an ad for facebook or youtube or any other traffic source tick tock doesn't matter you're making an opt-in you're making a sales video the way people behave when they go through these steps of the funnel we can really get rid of the call booking and close that's not entirely important the way people behave when they go through these steps of the funnel is extremely difficult different so you also have to understand that making an ad making an opt-in and making a sales video based on a traffic source is extremely time consuming you can't just make a one-size-fits-all i can't just go i've literally not been able to do this uh outside of highrose highrish just works everywhere because it's just an extremely profitable funnel but i've never been able to do this on facebook and then youtube and then any other so here's what you have to understand next setting up this kind of system right here is extremely time consuming just on its own okay this is this is a lot of work creating three or four ads an opt-in and a sales video for each traffic source there's a lot of work and yes you can cookie cutter clone it back and forth but here's where it gets super complicated and so let's imagine we're doing this on facebook right here then we have an ad and then we have an opt-in and then we have the funnel itself which would be sales videos and whatnot so here's where you get absolutely hosed if you don't understand this the way you make an ad funnel work is for example my highros ads uh for my my software company didn't work at all last year okay the first ones that came up didn't work second ones that came up didn't work but now they generate almost 10x rois how does this happen how does this happen i'm going to be straight up with you a lot of it's word of mouth because hyrus just literally makes people's ad accounts generate 20 to 30 more money like that like clockwork every single time once word gets out about that people start buying it a little bit more and that's that's guaranteed by a 90 day refund guarantee that's not me just throwing something out there if it doesn't do that you don't pay for it so poke a call below anyways the way it got better is i kept looking at the responses to the ads the opt-in and the funnel and through that what happened is feedback loops and what a feedback loop is is imagine you're writing code for example or you're playing guitar either one but if you're writing code and then you run the code for example i code video games very badly all the time but when i'm writing code the reason why i really like the writing code is you instantly get feedback on the code so for example if there's a bug in the code when i go to run it it says there's a bug okay so i instantly know if something's broken in my code but more so if i run the code in a video game i'm going to be testing certain things when i'm writing the code and i'm gonna see something weird happen in the game all right outside the code crashing i'm gonna see like my character uh start dancing across the screen like a maniac because the ragdoll physics is thrown off or something like that i'm gonna go oh something's wrong and so my first code doesn't work my second code doesn't work my usually like 15th attempt at code because i'm terrible doesn't work but the 16th is perfect it gets there it's nice and crispy and it works and you can see how i got there wasn't by getting the code right the first time it was by the rapid feedback loops and constantly improving based on the feedback okay so the same thing is going on with ads but on a much slower scale your feedback loop is usually like one to three days instead of where it's coded it's every 30 seconds that's why you can rapidly improve code but it's hard to rapidly improve an ad because you have to look at a lot of variables so let's say the ad is getting low engagement the opt-in is getting five percent opt-ins and the funnel is getting one percent call conversions in this instance right here okay well i can go and look at all these data points right here and go okay cool we're gonna we're gonna improve the messaging of the ad we're gonna improve the opt-in we're gonna improve the funnel okay and so when we get that then we get the opt-in to 12 opt-in rates that doesn't look like a 12. uh we get the ad to medium engagement so this the cost of clicks and cpm goes down we get the funnel to two percent okay there's there's one feedback loop cycle right there okay and that's usually about like a two week thing and proving it like this okay then we do it again and we do it again and we do it again and just like lines of code we look at what happens and then we react we look at what happens and we react and over the span of six months what happens is this ad goes from low engagement to high as i figure out exactly what customers are looking for and what they're responding to so for example if you look at the first ads for hiros they're very different in the ads right now and that's because i looked at the feedback the customers were giving me okay i looked at what people were clicking and i looked at what ad and media buyers were clicking also in relation to my cpl or opt-in okay and so my opt-in went from you know five seven percent to 40 percent in some cases usually around 30 percent and then my funnel uh conversion rate went from one two percent to five percent to just so high now that i don't even really check it anymore it just works like at a 10x roi i'm i'm fine man this is this optimations this optimization is fine to start scaling with but this happened by me going through these feedback loops where are you going these feed draw don't drag these feedback loops over and over and over again in each feedback loop every result from a feedback loop would at least take about a week now here's what you need to understand about all this you're probably thinking alex what does this have to do with finding the best traffic source here's what it is if i was doing this on youtube if i was doing this on linkedin if i was doing this on tiktok if i was doing this on snapchat the amount of work required just to do this on one traffic source is already 40 50 hours a week if i throw on youtube now i'm at 100 hours a week i throw in linkedin i'm at 150 hours a week so on and so forth unless i start half-assing each traffic source i start going and only investing 20 of the time that's actually needed to actually perform these feedback loops but then what happens is you have these feedback loops that are extremely slow and not optimized at the rate they need to be at instead of taking one ad source to like this instantly with really rapid feedback loops with a ton of attention and time put into them all your traffic sources are going to go like this and this is a really bad example really bad drawing but this right here is probably going to generate five times more than all this right here slowly going up all right look it's for example if you invest in cryptocurrency right now if you invest in 15 different cryptocurrencies and you spread out your investment across all of them this is a weird example even if one skyrockets you're not really going to see that high of an roi whereas if you just focus on one cryptocurrency and you really nail it which again cryptocurrencies are outside of your control let's imagine the cryptocurrencies are inside your control in this example and you really nail it and that one gets a 15xry it's going to make it's going to make more money than having it split across 15 currencies you have to understand this about ads but the thing is unlike cryptocurrencies your effort and time invested controls the accelerated returns right here and you only have so much time to invest it's not like cryptocurrency where you have unlimited money you can make and invest you only got like really 50 hours of concentrated focus smart work you could you could do 70 but after about 40 hours i'm an idiot anyways so that being said if you have a hundred thousand dollars to invest in ads and you want to turn it into two million dollars okay maybe all right let's let's let's take down the numbers alex come on we want to turn into 500 000 our best way is to get into an ad source that's going to give us a huge return and just put it all in that ad source diversifying isn't really helpful in this case because you have to understand unless you're a giant brand that's making hundreds of millions of dollars per year there is more than enough traffic on facebook or youtube or linkedin or tick tock or snapchat to make you 10 to 20 million dollars per year easily there i have i've done it i know multiple people that have done it there is more than enough traffic source on just what there's more than enough traffic and buyers on one traffic source to get you to a income that is nearing tom brady's income if that's what you're looking for right here or at least taking your company to be worth one tom brady how much is a company worth a tom brady sir it's laughable but it's true so what's going to be the best traffic source for you in 2021 well it's quite obvious it's going to be the traffic source that you dedicate all your time to what you shouldn't be doing in 2021 is trying to run on facebook and youtube and tic tac and snap talk and snapchat and whatever club whatever the hell you're doing right here your best way to do it is just to pick one you can experiment with all of them and see the one that works out easiest for you and then just go all in because the thing that actually controls your roi on ad platforms isn't the traffic source it's the feedback loops and improving and optimizing around the if you only optimize if you have 50 hours and you spend 10 hours on each traffic source each one's going to get 20 optimization you're going to see that the way traffic sources work is it's exponential returns on your feedback loops so if you're only putting 20 percent in each one is kind of kind of like bobble and go like this bobble and go like this whereas if you put 100 in it works on an exponential curve so you're going to get farther down the curve and eventually the way traffic sources work is like this okay it's not going to go backwards but you're getting the point and this is when you master the feedback loop of one traffic source in one funnel so to wrap it up if you really want to kill it in ads what you want to do instead is find the traffic source that gives you the the base easiest returns so for example if i started running ads on youtube and facebook and if one of them gave me like a 1.5 x roi and the other ones gave me one x i would just go all in on 1.5 x roi and ignore the other ones until i have so much traffic that doesn't even make sense this is exactly what i did with hcom uh when i scaled it to 20 million dollars in sales facebook was always all over the place and working with their terms of service and everything was always just it was always just kind of like ah so i just said no i'm not gonna run facebook ads and i'm only gonna do youtube ads and the result was all right first off i got the little minimal bounce right here but then what happened is i went deeper and deeper into it okay and i scaled a business past amounts that i couldn't even imagine and i only used one traffic source if i'd used both traffic sources i would have gotten this i would have gone the [Music] like that i would have gotten i wouldn't have scaled it very far and that's the key to buying traffic it doesn't matter where you buy traffic from unless you're buying twitter ads that's that's that never works for anything okay uh ever but if you're buying any other traffic source i i know some in the comments because i need a million dollars on twitter ads you're not an addict okay cool man all right so that being said the way you're going to get the best return is by not diversifying your track traffic this is not a stock portfolio where the the the returns are out of your control so it's better to just spread it all out your returns are a hundred percent under your control and the time and effort invested into them and the returns are always going to be exponential okay if you put a hundred percent in something you're going to see vastly better returns on it than if you put 20 in something because you have to get farther down the curve the more time you put in the farther down the curve you get that's the best way i can explain it so in 2021 stop diversifying and stop trying to be a jack of all trades it doesn't work okay for example facebook works really really really well for me at hi-ros okay now we're actually seeing better results at google ads after all the updates and whatnot however for the first six to seven months i focus almost exclusively on that being said for hcom my info product youtube worked insanely better right off the bat so i only focused on youtube both companies have got an insane rois on their ad spend and it's not by me being a jack of all trades or an all-around ad expert it's by me analyzing what f what platform worked best off the get-go and then going all in on that platform okay so that's the lesson for today just a quick little summary to give you exactly what you actually came here for because i know i kind of tricked you if you're doing info marketing especially to the masses youtube works a lot better if you're doing b2b facebook works a lot better off the bat if you're doing ecom it depends on the econ proctor doing if you're doing like shirts or devices or something that falls outside of the health or wellness niche if you're doing something that falls outside of the skincare or appearance niche basically the big niches out there weight loss whatever then you're probably gonna do better on facebook if you're in those niches though that i just discussed you're gonna do better on youtube because those are mass market niches where you can easily just peg right into the person okay i would also just i would think about i would think about youtube in the future if you're an econ because it's crazy that also being said b2b again better on facebook uh b2c especially better on youtube all right especially if you're doing like a high-end info offer or something like that so for example if you're selling like info products like nine university freaking killed it on youtube uh with a call funnel okay but that's not b2b that's b2c like business is civilian person that's new to something b2b would be like highrose running to media buyers and business owners okay that's what you should look for now that being said two things if you're running any funnel tracking is the most important thing go check out hiros because if you are not seeing 20 to 30 percent of your ad data you're going to make the decision when it comes to scaling and turning off ads wrong 20 to 30 of the time that's going to lead to you making double whammied losses by killing ads that are working and keeping ads on that are not working if you're spending a hundred thousand dollars per year that's an extra thirty to fifty thousand dollars you're just losing just because go check out hyrus we have a 90 day guarantee that we will fix that and actually make you that extra income or you don't pay on top of that if you're interested in seeing how to scale your ads on youtube or even facebook book a call with me below the amount of businesses you can click on the page below that i've helped get to six seven and on youtube just alone on youtube is insane i have more results than any other youtube coach in the entire industry you should check it out at least because it consistently at least does good things or just like with highrose you don't pay all right i have 90 day refund guarantees on all my stuff because it works and if it doesn't work i don't want your money so that being now go subscribe because i release videos like this three times a week because is that how you spell subscribe i want you to make more money i don't hold anything back because i want you to make more money so you eventually buy high roast because everybody needs it for tracking so if i just help you make more money you're eventually just going to buy hybris so i'm just going to tell you everything i know how i've made tens of millions of dollars in gross revenue from go i generate tens of millions of dollars in revenue from youtube and facebook ads and how i grow my businesses with ads i'll just tell you how i do it because i want you to make a lot of money and then buy hiros that's it i'll see in the next video
