Oh, baby, baby, baby. Oh, this is going to be the chef's kiss video on this channel. Probably the best money-making video I'm ever going to make without hyperbole. And as you know, it's common knowledge that if you see a man in front of a Lamborghini trying to tell you how to make money, he's very trustworthy, peak credibility. It's like a PhD time 10 in expertness. Because what I'm going to give you in this video is perhaps the best business lesson or tactic I can give you. And combine it with using AI to make money. And this will all make sense in a minute. I will not be vague at all. I will give you exactly what to do in this video. But I truly believe what I'm going to give you in this video is probably one of the best money-making opportunities we've seen in the last 30, 40 years. Because what I'm going to give you is the core of making money in business, at least B2B, which is what we're going to be doing. But the variety and ways we can attack this with AI is something that no one else is doing. Not even other people on YouTube are looking at it this way. I'm going to give you a truly unique spin here. Not the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] use AI automation courses and buy my software [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you see all over YouTube. I have nothing to sell you. I don't have an AI automation course to sell you. I'm already extremely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rich from actually selling AI and I don't plan to stop doing that anytime soon. I'm just going to give you these lessons and I'm going to show you to combine it with AI. And these lessons are pretty good cuz they've helped me build a net worth of almost $200 million. So, they're semidecent. And by the end of this video, you're going to have a quick, easy blueprint you can use to go and build a type of business using this strategy. And it's simply going to work if you stick to your guns and do it. And sorry to let you guys down. No, the strategy here is not me making a digital prostitute naked version of me. I know you guys were really looking forward to beckerspecker.com making an AI manfu for yourself, but look, that's that's not going to happen. If that happens, something's gone terribly wrong in my life. So instead, what we're going to do is I need to break down this to you right now. Also, before we begin, everything that's going to be in this video that I'm about to teach you. There's a lot of concepts covered. There's videos on this channel covering every single little concept that I'm going to get into this video. So, after you watch this video, if you want to learn how to do the specific things I talk about, there's no course for you to buy. Just go watch it on this channel. It's right there. So, first off, before we get into this, yes, I want to recap. This is not going to be a vague video. We're going to go step by step exactly what to do. You need to understand why everybody else pushing AI lessons on YouTube right now specifically is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] though, because then you're going to understand why what I'm about to show you is so much better. And if you get this twist right here, you're going to avoid so much competition and you're actually going to be able to get results like this unlike everybody else. Let me explain why. If I go through YouTube right now and I look at all the videos on how to make money with AI, 99% of them are usually a person selling an AI makemoney course or an AI automation software. Now, I'm not going to poo poo on those people. As you guys know, I'm very humble. I would never talk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about anyone online. I'm very respectful, very humble. As you know, I'm the sixth year in a row most humble YouTuber winner. Graham Stevens been trying to get it from me for years. Not a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] chance, buddy. Graham, just sit the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] down. It's not going to happen. I am the most humble. Everybody knows it. also the 10-year winner of most ripped on YouTube. But we're not here to talk about me. We're here to talk about you getting exceptionally rich here. Now, while I will not talk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about everybody else, when you watch these videos, what they're doing, it's it's very intentional what they're trying to do. They're trying to build a business, teaching you how to sell AI to businesses and buy their automation software. Fine, whatever. That's a whole that's a whole different business model itself. The problem with any of those is when you start using something automated or pre-built or a pre-strategized method that is color in the lines, cookie cutter for you, you're going to run into massive competition with tons of other retards all doing the same exact thing. There are millions of people right now loading up AI agent software, loading up different softwares out there and trying to sell them as AI agents to businesses using templated frameworks and whatnot. This happens in every single business model when it hits the market. It happened in SEO. It happened with agencies. It happened with consulting, e-commerce, drop shipping. It's the same [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] thing. A framework comes out for making money. Everybody does it. It gets saturated and it gets tough. I don't like tough things. If you ever looked at my company, Hires, I have like two competitors. I don't like competing with people. I like to enter niches where I'm able to just be the only person selling because I'm going to give you a big tip for selling right here. If you're selling to someone and there's a thousand people selling to them, it's going to be hard to convince them to go with you. If you're selling to someone and it's just you and like another dork down the road selling to them, you have a pretty good shot of winning most of your deals. That's the biggest secret to selling right there. Just don't do what other people are doing. That's why we need to talk about how I'm going to show you how to do this in this video. Because once you understand this, you're going to be able to strategize in a way that allows you to sell something that no one else is selling, which is truly the key here. Cuz let's face it, you're not good enough to sell something hard. You're on this channel getting info from this guy. Something's gone terribly wrong in your life. We need the purple crown version of making money right here, which I'm going to give you. So, now we're going to hop over to the Harvard accredited whiteboard of truth. Actually, this is not from Harvard, okay? I would never take anything for Harvard. Everything that comes out of that school is [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] woke nonsense. And we also aren't extremely racist channel. So, no, we're not going to come from Harvard. We're accredited by Bugatti, okay? That that's much better. That's much more mature. So, you need to understand this base principle. And I know what you're thinking. Well, where's the AI software I need to use? Where's the AI specifics I need to use? Really, with AI, it's like Play-Doh. It's like water. You can make it do just about anything. The thing that most people are lacking is the understanding of how to mold this play-doh like substance into something that's cool. Okay, we're going to make it into like a duck. You know, businesses businesses love ducks. So, let's All right. All right. Back on topic. So, the base thing you need to understand right here is the principle of breakage. Now, what is this? This is something I totally made up in the shower before shooting this video. Uh what it actually is is it's understanding where there is breakage in businesses aka where they are making where they could make more money or they are losing money or wasting money. These points right here what we want to do is we find existing points in the business and if we increase them or decrease them a little bit the business makes $1,000 in gain, $1,000 in money saved. And when we make money for businesses like this through savings or gains, we're able to then bill them 200 or so dollars, 20% of the value that we did. This is one of the best ways to view business and building business products there is. For example, at my business, Hyro, what we do is we run tracking for large companies. We also do AI remarketing for them. Right now, I'm not here to talk about the product actually does, but what we do is when you plug it into ads, for example, the business makes about 15% more from their ads instantly and then saves about 10 15% of their ad spend. So if they're making 100,000 a month from their ads, they now make about 120,000 a month. We can easily build them a,000 2,000 bucks a month for that. That's the entire principle of my business. And so when we get on phone calls with people, the ending sales pitch is like, "Hey, so you know that you're losing $20,000 in gains right now. Why would you not want to sign up right now and test this? We literally guarantee you'll get those results. Why not sign up?" That close you you would think that sounds pretty effective, right? Guess what? It [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is. It's built a company that's worth a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ton of money. So this is a concept I try to play with anything when it comes to business. And so what we want to look at when we're examining businesses is not so much the AI tools or some templated strategy that other people have used because you don't really need a strategy here. You need an understanding of these businesses because the AI tools out there. I don't care what video tools you're using, what LLM you're using, what softwares you're using. You can go find them out there and there. You can just actually just ask chat GPE how to put things together. when we come to our final idea here in a second. They're all interchangeable. They're all liquid. And what you're really going to excel at right here is not using these cookie cutter tools that are based for specific strategies, but knowing how to combine different AI tools out there together to make a unique service that nobody else has. So, let's talk about how we'd actually go and do this from start to finish. So, the first thing we want to do is we want to go research businesses. Now, I like local businesses, doctor's offices, dermatologist. Whenever I make up these examples for local businesses, I can only think about like medical things. Gyms, gyms, that's one. Uh, roofers, any of these [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] okay? You know what a local business is at this point. The reason why I like these ones is they're pretty easy to contact and reach out to, and you can think of them pretty easily. But you can also go do this for e-commerce websites. You can go do this for SAS companies. You can go do this for any type of business out there. Like I have a buddy who sells light bulbs, like he has a giant light bulb company. Go do it for [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] light bulb companies. anything. Anything. People that move dumpsters around, I don't I don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] care. Anything. What you want to do is you then want to dig into these businesses by either talking to them or just looking at them or calling the business and going through their funnels and see where things are broken. So, here's a very specific example. Let's say you have a doctor's office right here. Or let's say you actually have a corporate event planning business. I'm going to use this one as an example right here. So, we could go look and go to their website, book a call, call their phone numbers in the after hours, find the places where they're probably losing customers at. If you look at most businesses, that's the easiest place to find it. Now, there's also going to be places where they could gain more customers on their website as well. So, what we want to do is we want to go look at their website, look at all their funnels, look at interact with all of them, go dig through them, dig through it, email them, message them, do all sorts of stuff. Do it to multiple businesses out there and look at them and poke the business around and see where they're not following up with you. See the places of the website that are weak for no reason. see the places where they're missing business. Okay? And so when you do these things, here's a very good example at this. Let's say we have a a we're going to do this for corporate event planners. So one thing we could do after going through this is we can notice that when we go and place our email or our business email on the opt-in form or we call them up. What happens is nothing at a lot of these businesses. Now this isn't I don't want you to look at this template. I'm just thinking this up as I go as an example of how we can find breakage in the business. So let's imagine this corporate event business for example. they're not following up with the business is following up with them. What we could do easily with AI is when a phone number comes into the business or a business email comes to the business, the AI could literally find out what business this is attached to, go research it, then also learn everything about the corporate event planning company. You can upload this and create a different type of model in chat GBT, for example. You can combine it. Uh I forgot what the word for it. We're just going to call it a tweaked model. And so you can create a custom GPT language model. I'm just going to call these bots for now. I don't know how deep you are with AI. I'm I've been nerding out on it for a few years so I can use all the big fancy terms, but I don't want to act or pretend like I'm smart here. I'm going to keep this at fourth grade level for you. Purple crown only. You got it, guys. Trust me. This the brand of this channel is built by retards for retards. And we're not we're not changing anything. Nice lowquality, low IQ content only here. Everything you come to expect. So, we're going to create GPT bots. They're experts in the business. connect it to an AI that's able to research and look at their website, look at the business, entering in, and we can have it email them and text them about how this corporate event business can specifically help their business with specific details and find testimonials or past customers that they've had that relate to it and then get them to come book a call or come into the next step of the funnel or something like that. This little bot right here would probably increase the close rates on their emails or their opt-ins by 10 20%. So, let's imagine this 100K a month business. You just made them 20,000 more a month by just doing this. This is how you want to view businesses when we're looking at applying AI to anything. And this is how I look at almost every business I build, but I have in the past used software to solve these kind of dilemas. The really big reason why I think this is probably one of the biggest money-making opportunities for normal people is twofold. Because one, a lot of these bots and tools don't require any code whatsoever. you can combine them together and get them to talk to each other with basic just basic effort. If you don't know how to make them talk to each other, just ask them and they'll [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] tell you how. And a lot of these things that are a lot of these advanced things I talked about that seem advanced are actually quite easy like building your own uh language model. For example, chat GBT will walk you through how to combine a entire business's information, all their support tickets, all their calls, all their sales history, all their customer base and everything into a bot that will understand the business and be able to ask and respond to customer support questions, whatnot. You don't even have to make that much that complicated a body. It could literally just be something that sends emails based on research it finds on websites, which is again not that complicated to do. If that does seem complicated to you right now, I I have basic news for you. Just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] figure it out. You want to get rich, you want to be richer than most people, you want to be able to sit in your house and make money without talking to people, you're going to have to do some slightly [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uncomfortable things and figure out a few things that the average human bear is not able to figure out. All right? Just be just be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clever for once in your life, please. I I don't want to be like every other make money channel. It's like, "Hey, you don't want to do any work or like put any effort into it? That's fine. No, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you. I'm not selling you a course. I'm not convincing you to buy my info product and that you can be a lazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and still get by in life. You don't want to figure out this basic stuff I'm going to have right here when the LLM's will literally tell you how to do it. You're going to be poor for the rest of your life. And I have no shame saying that. It's fine. It's all right. You're just not gonna make it. Enjoy the channel for the jokes." I have nothing to sell you at all. So, I don't give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] if you're like, "Oh, this isn't for me." Good. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off. All right. So coming back to that, the reason why it's so big is because there's so many different applications of this by combining different models and tools together. You can combine runway, you can combine a basic website scraping AI, you can combine chat GBT, you can train the chat GBT to do custom things, and you can put all these tools together to make something custom almost for every business that you look into, which means you're able to sell something that no one else is selling because you're getting off of these templated AI softwares that everyone's pushing out there that are really just chat GBT wrapped in a a fancy wrapper. So, what we're then going to do at this point is you got to go find the business model that you want to target. I I think I think I think going the obscure local business route like corporate event planner or something like that. You can specialize in these niches that really aren't being targeted. That's the huge other benefit right here that I have to add because what's going to go on is everyone's going to be targeting dentists and doctors and lawyers and [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] like that. No, no, no, no. You want to go and get specific. Target only injury lawyers. Target only specific types of dermatologists. target specific randomass businesses other people aren't thinking about. Roofers that only work on skyscrapers, something like that. The best way to go and break into a niche is not to go into the big niche. Find the micro micro niches inside of it and dominate that. And if you're just getting started business, you don't need a lot of clients to make a lot of money doing this. You need maybe five clients. So, you can literally, if there's only a hundred of these businesses in the entire state of Texas, you just get five of them. All right? And you can go really niche down. You can start branching out the more results you get and you can take bigger and bigger beaches or more competitive larger markets. But you don't need to take a large market when you get started. So then what are we going to do with all of this? Well, first you can go and put on these businesses. And what I propose you do with this type of pitch right here, how do you sell it to businesses? Offer to do it for free and then charge them when they make money. That that's literally it. Like one of the pitches at my business is you put Hyros Air on your site. After it starts making you money, then you pay for it. I love doing that. You should love doing it, too. It's the best pitch in history. If your product actually works, why not? So, get your first few clients doing this. And you can also get testimonials doing this. And I think you should just do this by default because it'll allow you to get ahead of everybody else. And if what you're doing with AI actually makes money, you'll you'll make the money in the end. So, why not just do that? Now, then what you want to do is you actually want to go provide the service, build a little AI infrastructure with them. How do we go about doing that? You go to chat GPT and you describe exactly what you want to do and you ask it to describe how to put it all together. It will find tools on the internet, give you all the API connections. Heck, it will probably even put the API connections together for you and then you learn how to do it that way. This is going to be unlike the other channels out there like you're going to give you some template, but then you got to buy their course or buy their software. You don't want to do that cuz the second something is easy to replicate, then it becomes easy to replicate. Instead, go out there and figure out the unique little monster that you're going to build with with different combinations of AI that people haven't thought about yet to fix the breakage in the businesses. And then sell that [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that no one else is selling. It's just you and your little monster that you you created for free until it gets some results. And then when it gets some results, build them. And then do that over and over and over and over again. When you start getting three, four, five clients, train someone else to do it for you. And then you just focus on getting clients. And then you sell this little [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to kingdom come. And if you want to get really clever, then you turn into a tool and then you get on YouTube and you sell to other [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] to sell to other businesses and you get a cut or something like that. You just flip the whole entire system on its head. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the IM gurus. You become the IM guru and you start selling [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] even though you've never made any money on Earth except till yesterday. It's the business model everybody else does. You might as well do it, too. Jokes aside, that would actually probably work. That's not the lesson from this video, though. The lesson from this video is the lesson that I just gave you right here. how to think because how you think is going to be the thing that gives you the huge edge against everybody else trying to do this right now. You want to think differently. You want to sell something that has no other competitors. There's nothing else like it. You want to bust into the lower niches and specific business models that are so fine you can like custom suit them like a glove. For example, if everybody's selling to doctors, you sell to, I don't know, foot doctors, okay? Something like that. I I I don't know. While everybody else is super optimized for doctors, you're going to win. You're going to lose every doctor deal except all the foot doctor deals. And so everybody else will be fighting fighting fighting and you'll be specialized for this one and you'll win all of them. It's not a ton. There's probably only like 500 foot doctors in the entire state of Texas. But if you get 10 of them, you're doing pretty well. And then you can like expand to like I don't know butthole doctors that they're there. I think that's probably a profession, isn't it? I don't know. Whatever part of the body you can go do that. I don't know how doctors work if you can't tell. But you want to go into those smaller niches because you can easily glove fit them and have a huge edge in every single one of those deals. Then when you figure out where the breakage is in these businesses, go interact with their entire business. See where they're not following up. See where AI could create a solution right there. AI is very good at replacing little tedious parts of work that they just don't have time to do. So, for example, every single person that opts into a corporate event planner's website, they just don't have time to go research every single opt-in business and send them a custom fit email talking about all their testimonials and specific things that relate to that business and closing them based on how the two businesses will mesh together. It's very tedious to do that. You could do that for them and that would make them so much more money. That's an example of breakage. Then, finally, go out to these businesses, offer to do it for free, and when it makes money, they will pay you 10 20% of the money it makes them. That's it. then then track it. Then get them signed up. When it makes money, you build them. When you're making a lot of money from it, you hire employees to do it for you. And then you sell the service like an agency. Then if you want to be a really smart cookie, you turn it into a software and you sell it to goofballs on the internet who are looking to get rich quick. And then you run off to the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hills, buy a Lamborghini, and sit in your garage and give advice to strangers on the internet. It's the best business model that's ever existed. So that's the video. Hopefully you liked it. Um, here's some other videos that break down business models and how I do it. As always, subscribe, like the video, cuz I see who likes and subscribes. And we're going to be able to give you all the courses on selling copywriting ads that I created in the past. We're going to deliver that to all of our subscribers when we hit a certain subscriber count. If you're not subscribed, you're not going to get that. Have a nice day. by
