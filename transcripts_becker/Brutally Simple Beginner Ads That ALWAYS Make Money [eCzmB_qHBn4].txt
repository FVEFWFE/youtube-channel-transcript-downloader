what I'm about to give you in this video is probably the most foolproof method of all time when it comes to advertising if you just apply this it's almost impossible not to make money you can be a beginner selling boogers and this will still work for you I'm in fact using this exact ad method on you right now you're literally in the funnel you're in The Matrix you're absolutely [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you giving me money is imminent just kidding but but kind of sort up and what this is is the patented trid dented bolded YouTube retargeting ret YouTube retargeting method I'm using all sorts of big business words to act like I know what I'm talking about but trust me this thing right here has absolutely for me for years and if you just apply it you can only use this advertising method I think you could build a seven figure business or add another seven figures to your business just doing this so let me explain and I'll explain it by explaining what is happening to you right now so look let's address the elephant in the room I have a pretty large software company I've made a lot of money in my day doing online marketing why on Earth am I making a video channel about business ads why on Earth would I possibly do that very simple if you notice the titles of all my videos if you notice everything I'm doing here it has the word ads in it f focuses on Facebook ads and if you notice this kind of kills the views a little bit I only get like 10 20,000 views per video trust me I could make self-help videos or videos about not drinking or no fap get hundreds and hundreds of thousands of views why the heck am I making ad videos it's very simple the people that watch these videos you you own a business you spend money on ads thus I assume you have money and the only people I want watching this channel are people that fall into that demographic so I'm very specific with my titles videos and thumbnails to always focus on ads so that people who are not interested in ads do not watch this channel why well if you've ever watched other channels usually people use this to get you on their Channel and then Hawk [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] at you they're going to sell you a course or something like that I'm not selling you courses why because selling courses doesn't make that much money it's a pain in the ass I like running businesses that make lots and lots of money if I wasn't so godamn talented yeah I'd be selling you a course right now but I've I work at the higher level joking but not on a real note though courses yeah you can make a lot of money doing courses I'm not pooping on you for selling courses but it's really hard to scale courses to the level of a more complex business like SAS or e-commerce it's just a little bit more tough but anyways that's my random about courses everybody thinks I hate course sellers no course sellers are awesome they make the world go around I just think as you evolve in business you should move on from course selling into higher levels of marketing for example if you go check out Alex Hero's Channel he's yeah selling little lowlevel courses but how does he really make all his money attracting businesses into the channel and in buying those businesses see how he's kind of worked his way up the totem pole there same thing I'm doing right here see on this channel everybody that comes into the channel comes into a nice little funnel and you get added to a retargeting list every time you watch one of these videos then what do I do well on this channel the first thing I do is I make sure to deliver to you red hot fire content with nothing asked in return why this gets you to watch the channel it gets you to trust me now there's a really cool thing that then happens after this if you go and apply what I'm talking to you about with ads you're going to make more money from your ads and if you want to make more money from your ads I'm going to assume that you also want to make more money than you're already making from your ads so my software company hyos if you plug it into your ads on average you're going to see about 15 to 20% more money coming from your ads just by tracking it accurately and feeding the data back to AIS so let's back up and look what's going on here I'm just going to sit here and help you blatantly to attract your attention to this channel cuz you are the Target demographic for my software company then whenever it Dawns on you that you want to make more money you will probably think of my software company and as you're watching around YouTube one of those software company ads is going to hit you either when you're searching on YouTube or on some website in the gdn network thus I'm building a absolutely perfect list of people that will buy my software and I'm doing it in a way that just purely helps you there's no point in any of that transaction where you lose even if you buy hyros it doesn't work there's like a thousand day refund guarantee on the thing so again there's no point in this situation where you lose and this is one thing I want to back up point up to you you want to create a situation where your customers never lose throughout the entire process of interacting with you what a lot of people do is they get people on the YouTube channel they help them out and then they lower them in businesses and products where the product doesn't really work and then they keep their money and don't refund them or they deliver a bad product how many influence do you see they run videos and then they deliver a bad product big tip I'll give you is once you get people actually to buy something from you don't them in the ass that that's that's the that's the Becker business tip of the day for you but all honesty that's what a lot of people do they focus so much on the sale nothing on the delivery just a beginner mistake in business so how do we back this all up to you the most effective advertising method ever is you make YouTube channels that are very specific and hopefully targeting people that have money you don't want to make these big all fitting YouTube channels so if you look at my main YouTube channel I have millions of subscribers but I talk about literally everything on there all the way from crypto to self-help to not drinking alcohol that that retarding list is nonsense there's nothing of use on there because it's a hobby Channel what we want to do is we want to make micro channels where we focus on very specific things and in my opinion you should focus on something where the demographic has lots of money that's why I like business to business you're not going to get a lot of views or at least not as many views as you would if you made some mainstream entertainment channel that doesn't matter if you have a retarding list of 30,000 people 20,000 10,000 people that like you have money and are your Target customer you can spend 20 30 bucks a day on YouTube ads just retargeting them and make tons of Mone doing that and so backing it all up here why am I doing this channel very simple it has built me a retarding list just in the past few weeks of 60,000 people who are interested in running paid ads how many people on planet Earth are watching YouTube actually run ads not that many I'd say under 100,000 I can order remarket and have a retargeting list that is better than any AdWords targeting I can ever get ever and this is why it's so damn powerful cuz not only is it the perfect demographic in list the list also knows me and so this is just something I don't think occures to many people and if you're targeting high value demographic businesses let's say we have 60,000 people on that remarketing list if I get 500 of those people on hyos that's millions and millions and millions of dollars a year added to our Revenue so think about with your business how can you make a channel that attracts people that are your Target demographic look at Alex Hero's channel for example I don't think he does these retargeting ads but he has all these business owners on there all he has to do is run a little retarding at at 10 bucks a day and he can attract multi-million dollar businesses to come to his workshops or his acquisition f Fel never even having to actually go out and run broad cold traffic this why this method absolutely rocks if you want to see the scripts I use for the ads that I run to these remarketing list it's right here if you want to see what I sell primarily a funnel that I use it's right here if you want to see my dog he's right there that's the video
