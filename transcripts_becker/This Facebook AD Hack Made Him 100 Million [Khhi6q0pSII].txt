================================================================================

this is not hyperbole i'm going to show you the most powerful tactic in all of paid advertising if you do this it will be very very hard not to make hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars every single business that makes a lot of money via paid advertising they do this all the businesses that struggle and are so we sitting around being like why don't we make more money from our they don't do this and it's such a simple concept it's like investing in bitcoin at 500 i'm not kidding you can just literally look at the data and say if you put 500 here you're going to make 5 000 back over a year you just look at it like clockwork over and over again it's the best investment of all time and it's called making a proper back-end to connect with your ads now i know what you're thinking okay beckons are boring it's not hot no trust me if you understand how to connect this back into your ads is going to change your business and how you run ads forever all the businesses i've taught this to in person they explode they get hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars worth of results by the way if you want to be one of those businesses just book a call with me below i'll actually break down exactly how you should structure this particularly for your unique business because you're a unique special snowflake you need something just for you sarcasm aside you really too but what you also need is to understand this concept i'm about to show you so let's just hop into the training i have to stress this i have to teach this because i almost see nobody ever do this and i'm not talking about beginners not doing this i have a master ad group where there's people easily doing 20 50 100 000 a month when they come in they're not doing this and when i tell them to do this they resist it for the longest time and then they do it and their business completely changes now i'm not trying to get you in the master ad group or anything like that i'm just like this is this is chronic across people that even know what they're doing see this lesson needs to fundamentally change how you look at ads because what most people look at ads like is like this they see you run an ad and then you make money on the other set of ads let's say you spend ten dollars here you make twenty dollars out this is really hard to do contrary to popular belief of people that aren't experienced with ads if you've ran ads you know how hard this is to do i will tell you straight up man running a webinar funnel where i had a high ticket product and then making a three to four x roi on the rebills so for example i'd be spending 25 000 a day to do about 20k a day back okay and you're like oh that's less than 25 very good but more importantly what would then happen after three to four months after refunds and everything came in this would usually be about worth 50k so i had to wait for the money to come in okay and so it could be from 50 to 70k it just depends on how many rebuilds and whatnot but let's just use the low end number right here that was super hard to do even that was tough and then going and running how ads how most people do they run an ad and they try and sell like a 47 product maybe something that rebuilds it is tough they have a 297 dollar product a book funnel they're selling like an e-commerce product that's a three not the three commerce okay excuse me it's a bit early in the morning this is tough i think i've said that enough times already and if you've ever ran ads you know how tough it is and most of the time when people are trying to scale their ads whether on youtube or facebook they get to this point where they get to maybe max a thousand maybe 5 000 a day which is already pretty damn skilled up but their ad margins just go down they go from making a 2x roi at 200 to 300 a day to just breaking even losing money and they're like what do i do ads are impossible it must be because i'm missing some secret sauce that you know tai lopez and russell brunson have been putting in their cereal that's not what's happening here this is this is how ads are meant to run because you have to understand when people are running ads really talented ad runners are running ads like this they run an ad and they are completely okay losing money on the front end this is the biggest lesson of all advertising the people that you're running ads against when you get past 3 000 per day they're doing this they're doing this a hundred percent of the time because you literally can't scale ads to a high margin to a high daily ad spend and really expect to make money on the front end of your ads and your front end is essentially what is sold immediately after that it's what the person sees the first time they interact with you it just doesn't work now of course there are such exceptions to this rule but if you're in an industry where you have multiple competitors and there's multiple people buying ads targeting the same customers as you are you're selling something similar other people you're not you're not going to do that you're just not again there are exceptions but it's very very rare and it's better to play by the rules and crush it within the rules than trying to be the exception to the rule because you just have to get lucky if you're going to be an exception to the rule this is exactly what russell brunson did to grow clickfunnels if you know they do pretty well it's like a 500 million dollar company or something like that and the concept they use to get around this is when you're running ads you're going to compete against people that are okay losing money on their ads or breaking even so how do you run a business like that it's very easy you run ads with the goal of breaking even or not losing that much and then you track your customers over time and that's what's going to tell you how much they're worth to you over a period of time so for example when i was running my first business source wave how i made money is i could never make my ads work at all you know you think oh alex is some ad group i couldn't i couldn't make them profitable ever so i thought to myself why don't i just collect opt-ins and so what i did instead is i kept getting people to opt into my business give me their email address for about four dollars and then what i did is i tracked over time how much these people made me this is a great drawing yes i know we can frame this later but i tracked how much they made me over six months and over six months if my memory recalls i might use a different number in other videos forgive me it's been a long time but they made me around 25 okay so about a 5 to 6x roi okay this worked like crazy this got me to over four million dollars a year at hiros because all we did was simply buy emails and send them down an email funnel where they get sold stuff and be built they they gradually get to know the brand and get sold more stuff so this is great i'd put four dollars in and make 25 over here and people are investing in ethereum right now like crazy because they think it's gonna 5x they don't even know i had mathematical proof that if i put four dollars in it would turn into twenty five dollars and so i just put as much four dollars in as i could this is the most powerful concept of all of advertising let me take you to the next level all right this is what russell brunson did at clickfunnels when i did it market hero to get over 20 000 subscriptions basically for free almost now free is is is used in quotations right here so what russell did for example is he made a 997 dollar course and then got people to sign up for a free trial of click funnels at 99 per month so what happened well this ad right here broke even i've heard russell talk about many times i think they lost money on it most of the time that doesn't matter because if they spent two thousand dollars on ads and got hundreds of people in two people bought this and it paid for the two thousand dollars an ad so just basically pawned itself out it completely covered the cost but then let's say let's work this down to normal numbers let's say they spent ten thousand dollars on ads to get one thousand people into the business okay and then ten people out of the thousand one percent bought this 997 dollar course well that 10k made just covered up this 10k right here but then they have a thousand people that are qualified customers interested in selling info products and whoa what do they have to sell them click funnels for 99 free trial so if they can go in there and get 10 of people in here okay ten percent of people that's a hundred people that just sign up for click funnels let's just use rough numbers right here and at 99 per month that's ten thousand dollars per month now what's happening right here for the ten thousand dollars i spent they got a thousand people in for free and now they're going to make a hundred thousand dollars off this back end right okay 10 000 spent 110k actually made when you look at the numbers long term okay so for example what i would do at highrose the longest time is i actually would run an ad campaign where i'd make a little bit of profit okay that one i was talking about was really scaled up so we'd actually 2x over three to four months and so i was fine with it but while doing that my initial product my front end covered the cost of the ads well i got tons of people signing up for a free trial on market hero and that's just literally what i do all day long it's the most powerful easy way to make money with ads ever because making a front end that gives you a 2 3x roi and a very profitable business it's extremely hard most you can't do it i've tried many times okay the only business i've ever been able to do that on is hirose which has an extremely high ticket funnel which i've already talked about on this channel and why that's why call funnels are far superior check the check the description there's a free training on that below it's not it's not a pitch training it's just on youtube you can watch it and that works really well but you have to understand my ads behind hiros and they're extremely profitable most profitable ads ever ran very simple ad runs person gets on phone call we usually make a two to three x but that isn't even where the money's made the money is made on the rebills when the person signs up so a person comes on they sign up for hiros they pay x amount and then they're paying i don't know let's say it's really high in the count two thousand dollars per month per year that's 24k with money paid up front so that's that's that's the concept you need to understand about ads whenever you're looking at ads in the future if you want to be a person who makes a lot of money from ads what you need to focus on is not this equation run ad make 2x roi you need to focus on running ads that break even because you it's so hard to be spending 5k a day and be making a profit on top of it can you do it yes is it extremely hard yes and as soon as it starts to get extremely hard man if it's hard at 5k a day getting the 7k to 15k day and really tripling or quadrupling your business it's not going to happen but if you can knock out this ad spend and then make a 5x roi on your back end which is extremely easy to do you're going to be on fire and you can out bid you can out spend you can now advertise literally everybody because very few people do this and the people that do there aren't that many of them okay so once you get into this range where you start thinking like this you go from competing with hundreds of people to like five people in theory v sub v so that's the lesson for the day that's the thing i want to share with you and adds if you can just understand this concept you're going to crush it the other most important thing you should be able to do is track this i mean check this out right here if i just go and look at the amount i make for every single person that books a call at hiros you can see in the first month it's really not that profitable after nine months it's insanely profitable i'm usually paying like eighty two hundred dollars per phone call right now it's just it's just printing money at that point because i know the back end numbers that are going to be coming in if i go look at another call okay i'm paying about 150 for these phone calls right here makes 900 over about nine months if you know these numbers right here it just becomes insanely easy to run out i can pay 200 300 per call my ad cost can triple and i'm still just fine because i know these numbers right here by the way this is being done in high ros on top of actually tracking your ads accurately and fixing the ios crash update issues i mean it also does this too so again if you're scaling you should be working around accurate numbers because if you're not you're growing your ad account based on mystery and intrigue which is not usually the most profitable thing to do that's the lesson guys on top of that if you want help growing your ads grow putting them on on top of that if you want help growing your ads getting on the youtube and scaling up your ads on youtube you should book a custom strategy call below we can hop on i can actually give a unique strategy because this is kind of a one-size-fits-all thing that we just did and you wouldn't want a one-size-fits-all pair of pants so you probably don't want that for your business which is a little bit more important than your pants depending on who you are if you're a person that's really into your pants maybe like 50 is important that being said i will see in the next video in the next videos this week we're going to be talking about scaling up our facebook ads the right way and also how to sell high ticket products more effectively you should subscribe so you see those videos again anything i've mentioned is below in the description i'll see in the next video [Music]
