================================================================================

since the dawn of time since the days of achilles since the day of caesar octavius and marcus aurelius there has been one question on the minds of human beings what is the best ad platform who will get you the cheapest people to your website to buy things in an efficient way that's literally caesar quote from him right here uh look it's 2021. you're probably wondering should i use facebook should i use youtube i have scaled businesses to eight figures on youtube and facebook i have helped multiple people scale to six seven and eight figures on facebook and youtube i own hiros which helps people track their ads correctly to get a higher roi and then combine that with the ai on facebook and youtube to optimize your ads get even higher roi so i can kind of see what's happening across the entire industry across almost every single niche so when i tell you in this video i'm going to tell you which platform is better in 2021 well i got a lot of data points and so it's probably going to be closer to true than it's not or at least better than all the other people screaming like this is the best thing we're going to use data and what you're going to see in this video is that they are better at certain things depending on your business depending on the type of funnel you run depending on what you're selling it's sometimes better to start on facebook other times it's better start on youtube and so i'm going to be breaking it all down for you in this video that being said i can only get this so much in a 15 minute video so if you'd actually like help with your ads my team and i have actually helped multiple businesses scale to six figures seven figures eight figures actually hundreds of businesses at this point you can click below and see all the results you can book a call with us and we will actually help you scale your ads as well and we'll hop in a strategy call with you and actually show you everything you need to do to scale your ads on youtube which i think is a little bit of a better traffic source this year by about 25 percent let me show you why all right guys so let's just get down to it we're talking about what is going to be the best traffic source of 2021 and if you want my overwhelming decision i'm going to give it to you at the end of this video but you have to ask yourself with these two traffic sources youtube or facebook what niche are you in and i'm going to cover the niches in this video i'm going to cover kind of my predictions but these aren't predictions i see the stats every day and it's really obvious here's what you need to know all right it depends on what niche you're in whether you're in e-commerce or in a certain niche inside of e-commerce i'll get into certain niches that are very different or if you are in high ticket infield marketing which would be sales call funnels where you're selling an 8k product et cetera or if you're in consulting okay and so i want to talk about these three because these are really you if you run an online business you probably fall into one of these categories all right so so first things first let's talk about youtube for info businesses okay so look when you're running an info business you have to understand that youtube is by far the most superior traffic source for info marketing period okay so for example if you check out the page below i'm not saying sign up or book a call for iron but when you do check out that page you'll see countless businesses that are in info marketing that have crossed the six and seven figure market is primarily fueled by youtube on top of that when i look at hiros every single day the businesses that are crushing the most on youtube are going to be info business now does this mean ecommerce and other businesses won't crush it no it's because when people are watching youtube they're in an info-consuming mood they're there usually to learn if you're catching them on youtube now there's there's definitely circumstances on youtube where people are not there to learn but you need to compare the state that the person is in when they're on facebook versus the state that a person is when you grab them with an info ad or a education ad on youtube on youtube they're actively watching something on facebook they're in the line at whole foods doing something else it's it's very easy to understand why they convert so much better to webinar funnels and why they convert so much better to sales call funnels i'll be getting into these funnels actually in the next video we're going to be trying to release about three to four videos a week in the next video i'm going to be talking about the best sales funnels for youtube and facebook right now so the reason why i can say this is because when i scaled one of my info businesses i was spending anywhere from 15 to 25 000 per day and i'm going to tell you straight up that when i was spending this amount of money right here the returns on youtube were significant so for example if i was spending 15 25 k a day what would usually happen is when we did everything back when did all the payment plans completions whatever we're usually doing about 40 to 50k back a day okay and of course there'd be all sorts of other hard costs and businesses and stuff like that so we could probably lower this down to i don't know 30 to 40ish k a day on good days so i don't want to use big imaginary numbers that's about what we were doing around this time so that being said when i run these same exact ads on facebook i would get a much lower return that's why i think if you're an info marketer right now and you're running ads on facebook it's just silly because i think the number one reason why they perform so much better is that key they're already watching something mentality and info is sold with sales videos okay info is sold with sales videos people don't know who tai lopez is because of his facebook ads they know who he is because of his youtube ads so that's what you need to focus on right here 2021 by far if you're in an info business and you're not running youtube ads you are missing out on growing your info business immensely because what's going to probably happen now that all the election and everything is over hopefully the us is about to go like this and with that comes the demographic that buys info the most that's going to be your uh people that's going to be your middle class to slightly upper class incomes okay the people that have lots of money right now they're probably not buying info okay now don't get me wrong info is doing quite well right now however as soon as the nation starts to take up again which i believe is about to happen it's just going to explode and you want to be in a position to double down on that with youtube now let's talk about e-commerce the e-commerce that works really well on youtube there's two types of them there's high ticket e-commerce which is for example people may be selling solar power are really high ticket items okay so you might see people selling solar panel ads where you put panels in your house they have to be expensive because it doesn't really work you should check out my video that i'm going to link to right below this video i'll link to a few of them but it explains the type of products that work on youtube and why they usually need to be high ticket if you're selling little 30 dollar trinkets or the general things that you see people selling in e-commerce it usually doesn't work out very well okay so first off if you're running high-ticket e-commerce you want to be on youtube okay it's because again you're going to need sales videos and sales calls to sell these things and this is superior now if you are also running what i like to call entertainment e-commerce so if you're looking at makeup if you're looking at e-commerce products that tie in the channels with mass thousands amounts of views for example what's interesting right now is if you look at all the crypto channels that are blowing up if you were selling like wallet devices or things that help people stow their crypto that's a form of e-commerce now we do exceptionally well because the channels are blowing up however if you're selling weird off things like cat food bowls and whatnot that could actually do really well on youtube as well now that i think about it i've seen examples like that what you need to think about when you're running ecommerce on youtube and i see this all the time with people where it works and people where it doesn't work is you need to look at how many people are routinely watching videos that relate to your e-commerce product it's not really like facebook where you can easily go and target people based on their interest and then they just buy i don't know hats or something like that it's gonna be hard to sell those however if you're selling things that relate to the entertainment videos on youtube that does very very well now if you're outside those niches for example if like i was in the camping niche on youtube that probably wouldn't do very well because it's really hard to find mass amounts of views talking about camping it's really hard to find mass amounts of views where people are talking about air purifying machines yes the views are there but they're not there in mass okay you can probably target people that are interested in health and wellness way better on facebook and then sell them these devices that works a lot better and so if you're not in a niche where you can easily make the connection facebook is the reigning king of e-commerce okay you just that that's just what you should know about that now for consulting again it's another catch-22 because i've ran extremely profitable funnels actually run two extremely profitable funnels that are consulting funnels right now somewhat we could say this is also consulting in sas so at the moment i run hybros uh which is our software company which works for high level ad runners okay so basically a person plugs in the high roast they instantly are able to get like a 15 20 percent higher roi due to the tracking and optimization we provide that's kind of more almost like a consulting service because we sell something very high ticket and we sell it through a sales call funnel on youtube if i'm running these type of ads i don't get the same type of easy conversions that i do on facebook now don't get me wrong hirose ads work really really well on youtube for us but they're much much easier to run on facebook as far as my iron consulting program i run a little bit of ads on that and it's just they perform far better far better on facebook and the reason for this is i can't particularly explain it i think it's just generally a lot easier to target small demographics on facebook okay so think about like this if you go look at the targeting for youtube what you're going to run into is it's very broad mass market this is the big difference between these traffic sources youtube is purely mass market marketing and so it's really easy to scale from a thousand to 25 000 a day it's totally possible to do i've done it before if you're in a mass market the thing is if i want to target people that specifically run ads or people that specifically maybe like contractors for homes very hard to do if i want to target like gym owners very hard to do facebook's as simple as going in and targeting people that fall into that demographic and have ceo owner something in their job title and are the heads of facebook ad groups and so it's really easy to run in these niches if you're spending one thousand two thousand dollars a day me extremely profitable that's just something you have to keep in mind this works incredibly incredibly well on facebook so i'm saying right now so i'm saying right now that while it's true that you can totally run consulting in sas ads on youtube the easiest place to get started is going to be facebook that's what i've seen many many times that being said if you understand how to tap into and make your ads work on youtube you can run youtube consulting and sas ads just fine i do this all day it's just a bit more challenging and so here's what i suggest you do in this instance if you're in this category if you're in this category right here you're probably already on facebook or if you're thinking about getting started start on facebook to get your copies and your funnel and everything that goes into what you're doing right okay and then what you want to do as soon as you cap out in traffic on facebook because here's what's going to happen when you get the thousand two thousand dollars per day it actually starts to get quite hard to target business owners now i'm not saying you can't do it you can definitely scale further than that but you start facing a lot of resistance and the easiest way to get past this resistance is then take it to youtube take your perfected funnels and then start slapping it on placements start slapping it and really layered intent audiences for example and i'm gonna you should check out our youtube guide that's on the channel i'll link to that below as well that's going to break down intent audiences and scaling and whatnot and what you then do from there is you make those layered intent audiences for example people are in advertising and marketing layered with people that make over 50 000 per year so you don't want to get people that are below that because they obviously aren't business owners and that works really well as well and so if you actually go and look at my youtube ads for hiros let me show you an example you can see down here for hirose we're at about 131 dollars per call and if you come over here to youtube it's a little bit higher but i find the quality is a lot higher okay you can see i'm some of these are really profitable for example this one right here i think we're getting like a 24 cost per call and it did 30 000 roi and just off of like literally in the last uh month right there did 30 thousand dollars roi off of only 20 a day so like it totally works google ads and youtube totally work you can see this one right here this was at eighty dollars a day um it's it twenty six thousand dollars in total sales right there and then that's reoccurring highest it works great um you need to understand that's exactly what i just did on facebook and youtube i went and scaled up on facebook first and as soon as i started seeing the roi start to dip a little bit i also then just take it over to youtube and i perfected the funnels on facebook and just drove them right over to and it works great if you understand how to do that my only suggestion for these type of funnels this is my biggest suggestion for 2021 and yes it's extremely biased but check this out right here so if i go and look at the sales funnel right here it says i got eight calls if i go look at the tracking and google it says i got three i would have shut down this ad and the cost recall is great i have no problem paying 300 per call that's very profitable for us long term that being said if i saw only three calls right here that would mean i'm paying like 500 per call and i would have turned off the ad i would have just shut down this ad right here instantly right here seven calls at 212 dollars a call that's fantastic okay but if i were to cut that in half by the reported four calls right here i would have turned off this ad maybe all right that would take me to 350. if you're running ads like this first off based on these conversions and cost per call it's not accurate so you're just going to be flying all over the place with a sales call funnel or a high ticket funnel it's the most important thing to be tracking this way get wicked reports get high risk set up your own custom thing i don't know what you want to do okay um but more importantly with these type of high ticket funnels as well for consulting just giving you one last piece of advice you need to be looking at the roi because you can see right here uh there's there's ones down here where it has a great cost per call let's go and find one with a really good cost per call really good cost per call no sales coming in right here really good cost per call no sales coming in right here now this is a weird example because i'm pretty sure these will generate sales because i know how to hirose data trends but a lot of people just run based off the cost per call and they're buying all these calls that are really cheap they don't turn in the sales or they're buying all these opt-ins that are really cheap but don't turn the sales and when i was scaling on youtube from about ten to fifteen thousand dollars per day to twenty five thousand dollars i must have wasted at least almost five to ten thousand dollars a day in ad spend sometimes on opt-ins that weren't actually generating sales because i wasn't able to track like this so that's just a bonus tip right there so that guys is my analysis of 2021 and what you need to be looking at based on the business you're in if you're in info marketing get on just do it okay uh if you're an e-commerce think about what type of e-commerce you're doing i'm not saying this other type of e-commerce over here hats maybe like stuff where you can't tie it directly into videos isn't going to work um but if you can tie it in entertainment videos for example if you had like a facial roller device that irons out wrinkles or something like that and you were going and sticking that on makeup and cosmetic video ads that would crush it okay and if you are running a e-commerce object think about like i don't know you ever seen like those john deere tractors if you had something that was like really good like that and you were putting this on farming videos and whatnot where people have to make this large investment you can get people on the phone you can really work with that traffic because just with a little bit of traffic coming in from youtube you can sell you know five thousand ten thousand twenty thousand dollar object from that phone call so if you're paying a hundred dollars per call two hundred dollars per call that's fine finally if you're in consulting what i suggest you do consulting sas start on facebook once you have your stuff working you're going to start hitting a cap because you're not going to be able to scale us further or as far on facebook because what you're doing is you're working with these micro small audiences that are really hard or easy to target on facebook that are really easy to target on facebook and as soon as you start hitting a cap move over to youtube and then start scaling them with each other okay and that will kind of give you your total reach right there so all in all guys this has been the highros train for the day subscribe to this because i'm going to be releasing i think about three to four videos a week right now we're going to be talking about the type of funnels that are working best right now based on all the data i've seen at hiros based on everything i've seen in my experience in the next video
