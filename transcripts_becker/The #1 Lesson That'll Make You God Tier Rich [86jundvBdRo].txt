so look this little strategy I'm going to give you is not just going to make your business convert turbo highly with ads it's going to make your business grow stupidly fast even if you don't run ads and if you do run ads to it it will be like pouring gasoline on Kryptonite and if you don't know the element of kryptonite it explodes when you pour gasoline on it I it's commonly unknown fact scoot over there he he he let me know that one he's a big cryptonite expert but seriously this is the crack cocaine of business this is the biggest secret ever it doesn't even have to so much do with ads which I try to stick to on this channel cuz I'm putting you on an ads retargeting list but now that I've trapped you on there I'll tell you the secret anyways so look there's a lot of businesses out there that you can build but most of them suck and are hard to build if you look at most software companies if you look at most e-commerce companies if you look at most infom marketing companies you're having to pull teeth and nails to get someone to buy and while you can build a brand and while you can build a big business around stuff like that I don't like that because those pitches are hard and I want a product that has simply one pitch if I'm going to build any type of business these days it's only going to have one pitch and that's I'm selling you a $100 bill for $20 now let's back up what does that mean I'm sure a lot of people think oh I already do that with my course business or with my Consulting business or my service business or I sell the result with my e-commerce business no no no no no no we want push button slap no effort statistically proven you press this button you make more money results now what does that mean so a lot of people watching this video think I'm going to say like you should make an info product course where you teach people how to make money and it's guaranteed no what I look for and the businesses that I build is in every single business model there is out there there is breakage so for example in the advertising space if you look at hyos and advertising it's one of my software companies and any software company I build it plays off the same exact angle it's how I make so much damn money and why I don't need to sell you courses on this channel because I sneakily running a way more efficient funnel than selling courses but let's let's back up in it if you look at the advertising industry and you look at people running Facebook ads or Google ads any ads tracking isn't very good because you have to put tracking like alien xenomorph on every single part of the business and so Facebook Google everything doesn't plug in as it should and it never will and because of this people Miss 20 25% of where all their sales come from so this results in bad data being fitted the AIS results in bad results when they come to buying ads it lowers their ad efficiency just immensely so hyros fixes that so if you take a business that's making $200,000 a month and they plug hosin it instantly makes them 10% more so they're making $10 $20,000 more per month at this point in time I can easily charge that business $1,000 $2,000 per month no problem easy why because they're already making $220,000 per month and then they don't leave because if they leave then they stop making $20,000 a month and so what happens in this situation I have the easiest sale in history I get if I get that person on a phone call and say hey so here's your ads okay are you using tracking no okay so what's going on with your ads is how much are you making per month 240,000 200,000 okay you could be making $220,000 if you just cut this waste here in your ad account and you actually tracked your sales also here in your ad account do you see this right here there's a little bit more to that but literally I'm saying hey do you want to make an extra 10 $20,000 per month that's what every pitch needs to be but not just saying that it has to be push button as as well so what does that mean with hyros you install a tracking script you do what the customer support says you have this tracking you start making more money now this isn't a pitch for hos I want you to lay out and think about how we can make this in other products in every single industry in the entire world construction shoe making ammunition every business of the world there is some breakage point in the business I've never seen a business where there isn't some inefficiency in the logistics or some part of where the customer starts and where the customer ends up which is fulfillment of the product there's always something broken in there whether it's the customer support whether it's how they're shipping things whether it's how they store their data whether it's where they're getting their data from there's always something that is inefficient in that business and at this point in time all you need to do when you're looking around for a business to start is you find what is broken in businesses if you're poor and don't have money to invest you fix that that's your service you get you get a team of people you put them together and you fix that breakage you don't want to go and sell what everybody else is selling like an agency like oh I'll just run people's ads no everybody's selling that find weird ass businesses like the lighting industry like doctors I can't tell you how many people have made weird little businesses that fix breakage in doctor's offices that made millions and millions of dollars chiropractors look at Alex rosi's gym launch for example no one thought about fixing breakage in gyms he did he made fck tons of money but that was a service later on he actually went and made a software for the gyms as well that plugged into their customer support and everything guess what he made tons more money fixing breakage and so the reason why this converts so well from ads is is it's so damn easy to do a few things one it is so easy to get people coming through cuz you are promised them guaranteed money for doing nothing and you can actually back it up and do it the hardest thing that most course businesses have and they're put into this unfair situation because the promise lad in course industry has been escalated to the point of insanity if if you're not promising a person making will make a million dollars in their first year with your course you you're you're behind all the competition and the size of the promises you're promising it's really it's really bad race to the bottom over there same thing with agencies and stuff like that it's just too competitive but if you can find the right Niche you can actually promise and back it up people will get on the phone with you all day and all you have to do is prove that it works through testimonials and just pointing it out and then guaranteeing it so for example at hros when we back up and prove everything in their account we say also you have like a billion day refund guarantee like we'll just give you your money back if you don't make 15% more hyos has been around for half a decade now obviously the guarantee has worked it gets everybody across the Finish Line you can't offer that type of guarantee in any other type of business and then finally it makes it incredibly easy to get testimonials because then you can reach out the big people small people any people and say hey will you put this in your business and let it make you more money for free it will fix this thing in your business it's a gap you know it's a problem you know your accounting system's will you put in your business for free and if it works will you just give me a testimonial they say yes you do that 15 times you have 15 testimonials you get people on a phone call you show them the 15 testimonials you get them on the guarant and voila easiest ads to run ever hey do you want to make more money guaranteed click here get on phone call sell it to them this is why any business I build at the moment it has to fit that criteria even new products I launch at hyos right now or other my other software companies if we're talking to devs and we're talking about features the criteria is does a customer push a button and make more money doing nothing or very little and do it become such an asset to their business they can't quit if it doesn't fall in that situation don't build it if it does build it right away and again if you're if you're I don't want to say poor I use bombastic language on this channel if you don't have the funds to start a software company you make a service that fixes breakage very specific breakage in companies not what everybody else is doing find very specific problems and very specific business models and fix that then you can specifically speak to those business models and lower them in and then actually deliver and have them happy and paying you for years it's a secret to everything just do this you don't even need anything else on this channel there's no other business courses you need this is all you need to do the second I stopped trying to fight tooth and nail and sell services and software everybody else is doing and just focused on focus on specific Industries and their breakage and doing this it's never been hard at all to make tons of money so you should do it too so if you want to see the actual ads that I run to bring businesses in they're over here somewhere somewhere on this page video if you want to see the funnel I run it's around here somewhere as well and if you want to see how I gather up all those testimonials and get people promoting my procs for me like I talked about in this video this on the video as well and if you want to see scoot he's over there that's it goodbye
