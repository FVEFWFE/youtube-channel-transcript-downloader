================================================================================

ladies gents and a few of you ad goblins you know who you are i talked about your last video i'll talk about you again in this video welcome to video number four in our advanced facebook ad series this video is going to get into advanced bidding and optimization aka how to scale your ads efficiently without ad costs going out of control and how to keep your costs as low as possible when you're running ads now i have some bad news for you some very bad news there is no secret to bidding there is no magic freaking targeting demographic thing that's going to keep your ad cost super low there's not some magic crazy complicated way that only two percent of ad buyers know that allows them to keep their ads cheaper than everybody else everybody thinks this is a thing and so before i show you how to actually do this correctly in this video i need to nip this in the butt because this is something that everybody puts forward in the ad community or puts forward the people that don't run ads or even gets pushed up all the way up to high level ad buyers the secret to scaling ads almost never has to do with some secret duper cool technique magic targeting system bidding strategy that only jeff bezos and his gang of merry men know that nobody else knows that's not how it works what i want to show you right here is exactly what scales adds and keeps ad cost super low and allows you to get to those high levels of scale but also allows you to maximize your profits and maximize your roi while keeping everything as low as possible this is how it's done okay guys so we're at my whiteboard of truth and justice it's very cool i know we've invested a lot in the presentation value of these hi-ros facebook ad series videos i hope you're impressed let's continue i'm not trying to show off it just happens naturally look so when it comes to bidding and growing and optimizing your ads for growth what a lot of people are going to tell you like i just said they're going to try and tell you there's some secret bidding technique or like there's some magic targeting that you need to hit that's going to light a scale that's not the case what you want to be able to do to make ad scales you want to be able to scale like a dumb person you want to be able to scale in a way i can't even spell dumb correctly but you want to be able to scale in a way that doesn't require you to do anything complicated in the ad manager because frankly as soon as you start trying to do complicated things in ad manager the ads already failed okay there's some big broad audiences out there where sometimes setting your demographics and whatnot is going to help you but outside of the tips i've given you so far facebook's optimization if you put those tips i've given you so far is going to do most of that for you it's if your demographic is men in a certain age group you're going to see the spread of being men in that certain age group you don't really need to guide it that much and so what most people do is they get to these plateaus and their ads and they keep thinking oh i just can't get past this point uh unless i have to discover some secret bidding technique or something and so they just keep trying to find magic bidding techniques and go up and down up and down up and down and up and down it never works and then what they try and do is they try to go and say okay cool well i have these 50 stats i got my ctr i got my cpc i got my nwa i got my backstreet boys it doesn't it doesn't there's all these extra stats that people pay attention to and i'm gonna tell you i've scaled on other platforms i've scaled on facebook i mean i've scaled a combination almost thirty thousand dollars a day in ad spend and there's really only three metrics you need to look at and it applies to this video as well because when we're talking about optimizing and scaling ads really the only things i pay attention to and i think you should pay attention to or you should at least take my thought process here into into your thought process is i look at cpl which is going to be the cost for an opt-in if i'm running a webinar or maybe a sales call funnel i'm going to look at cost per call which i'm going to refer to as cpc for now on so don't get too confused there cost per call which is going to be again if i'm using a sales call funnel and then i'm going to look at roi you might be saying well why don't you look at uh you know cost per sale i don't care about the cost per sale i care about the roi okay i could have a great cost per sale but if there's no good uh the roi is not there doesn't matter okay so that's what we're going to be looking at and so why do i look at these things it's because these things are a symptom of basically every other metric in your ad account but the thing is if you look at every other metric in your ad account you can't really make a conclusion from them and so if you're trying to improve your c ctr you might actually end up in reducing your roi if you go and improve your cost per click you might reduce your roi and so improving these things without context doesn't make any sense and that's what most people do they're like oh i got my cost per click down great but your cost per lead went up so the only thing that actually really matters as far as your marketing go is these doozies right here you can change these numbers around all you want but unless they unless these numbers go in the direction you want them to go in it really is a matter so it's just better to focus on these numbers from the get-go but why are these numbers so important when it comes to optimizing your ads well it's because they're going to tell you what to optimize because the way you actually optimize and i'm going to have to have my cheat notes in front of me right here because this is kind of a long spiel but the way you actually optimize is there's a bunch of parts of your ad okay there's going to be your ad message okay the actual copy of the ad the landing page message they're originally sent to and copy the sales page message and then the sales page copy and these are the things you play with you don't optimize the numbers in the ad manager you don't do that that's not how you scale because optimizing those numbers isn't going to relate and you're selling more stuff at a higher frequency thus making your ads profitable and you being able to scale them what will increase your ability to scale is affecting that again this is so simple and so clear but no one does this what allows you to scale more is if you put one dollar in people are you getting a higher roi in that one dollar okay that's it more people buying at a higher frequency that's what allows you to scale because as you start scaling the thing that's going to stop you from growing let's imagine this is where you keep hitting at the thing is going to stop you from growing is your ads being profitable that's it if your ads are profitable you scale and so the thing you want to focus on is making the ads more profitable and then the dials that you tweak to make your ads more profitable are these dials right here these dials right here and the way you really optimize as you're scaling is you start really right here and you work your way down here now i know this doesn't make any sense because i'm baboon and i don't explain anything well and i but i'm gonna do my best here okay i'm a simple baboon but i'm gonna do my best explain this you might be thinking look at all those things what's ad message what's the difference between add message and copy so let's talk about all these things right here and then how we'll tweak them over optimizing so you're gonna first notice that when a lot of people go and write their ads they just make one set of ads and one like message of the ads and then they just never change it and they don't understand why their ads don't grow so what is the ad message so if i'm running an ad for hirose my ad message should be hey improve your business with tracking or my message could be uh we have this ai tracking script that will say get you 52 cheaper get you customers 52 cheaper on your ads which it will okay you should go you should go book a call with ios below if you're running ads without tracking this point you've watched this this video guy i don't know what you're doing man i'll show you some crazy stuff here in a second that being said look at how that message is different use tracking in your business or we have this nifty little ai when combined with tracking gets you customers 52 cheaper one message is awful and boring and isn't gonna excite anybody no one wants to track their business no one cares or this one right here that gets you customers cheaper and makes you a lot of money that's a different message and you're gonna really notice in your ads the thing that's gonna get you higher rois is nailing your message and it's picking out what people actually want about your product and so when you start going and messing with your ads one of the easiest ways to unlock a lot more scales not by bidding optimization and manual bidding it's going to figure out the message people really clicked with for example at hiros of course my first ads are like hey track your ads because it's going to improve your roi didn't work at all next message was like hey we'll go and help you scale further doesn't work at all and then another message was like hey you can track your ltv and you can see your long-term sales you can see a person that clicked six months ago and see everything they did between now and then and see exactly which ad generated that sale worked a little bit better didn't work and we went through many many many different things the thing that really clicked with people was saving 52 on their customer acquisition cost and their ads this was the message that hit okay and you can see that reflected in if you're running an opt-in funnel in the cpl that's you see how i can tell how people are responding to something by looking at at certain numbers now roi doesn't really come into play yet in this fact share in this factor right here but i can see this in the cost and the cost per lead and a little bit in the cost per call why because i can see exactly how people are responding to the ad message overall and when people opt into high frequency or if we're just sending them straight to a sales page they start clicking at a high frequency and buying at a higher frequency you're going to notice the add message has a huge effect on that okay but the next thing comes into play the ad copy you're going to notice when you have the same message but different copy you explain the message differently you change how it's worded you change the the image on your ads you change the headline people start responding differently and you're gonna again notice that in the okay so for example one of the easiest ways we can scale our ads let's say our ads are profitable are profitable as is and we start seeing them break even okay well let's say we're paying ten dollars per lead and we're breaking even easiest way we can we can get back to profitability cut the cpl and half down to five dollars per lead we're going to be getting in double the leads at that point therefore the funnel doubles we just unlocked a whole bunch of scale okay again obviously cost per call if we get 500 opt-ins for a thousand dollars and then we get to a thousand opt-ins for a thousand dollars we're also going to see the calls double because the opt-ins doubled in theory so again we're playing with these numbers right now by going and tweaking the ad message and copy okay so now that we've gone and improved the opt-in rate of our funnels or how people are interacting with the ad originally we're going to go and focus on the landing page copy okay and the sales message so what does this mean so you're going to notice again your copywriting on your pages the message is what matters first off if you have great copywriting but the message is garbage and people aren't going to be interested in it you're not going to get conversions even if you have great copy okay and so what you want to first focus on now we actually have good metrics we have a lot of people coming to the page we have a lot of people opting in at a high rate this isn't always easy to see in e-commerce we're probably going to be just skipping straight to this step if we're sending people straight to a sales page for example a lot of times at hiros i send people straight to a call page and it's just you it's not always apples to apples on how pages are gonna make so for example like my iron mastermind i'm constantly sharing like the results of my split test and like what pages are working in some funnels what i'm going to see is i'm going to see that sometimes i'll send people to an opt-in and into a call and then sometimes when i send people straight to a call it works better okay and if you want info on that mastermind it's like we have more ad results six seven eight and nine figure results than like any ad mastermind ever there's a link in the description if you want to go check that out if you run ads you should check it out anyways what we're then going to start tweaking is we're going to have to go and look at our sales message and first start with that i know i put these in a different order but we go look at the sales message and if we can get let's say originally one of 100 people buys on our page we can get two out of a hundred to buy in the page well then their ads will unlock more profitability thus we can scale further with the same audiences and then what do we do once we unders once we see a message that clicks for example at highrose when people originally came through or actually let's use iron for example i have a youtube consulting mastermind why is it based around youtube because people want to learn youtube ads my original sales message was learn ads the next message was learn how to go and build funnels that work really well with ads and it really didn't start clicking until i discovered hey people want to learn youtube ads that's what they're interested in and then what i needed to focus on was how people were going to come over to youtube ads what they were most interested in and turns out they were really interested in ad copy and ad targeting uh and getting like a plug and play blueprint and so that was the message that worked to sell my youtube ad mastermind okay originally i was like hey learn ads didn't work when i was like learn the funnels that work on youtube didn't work learn the ad targeting copy that worked that's the sales message then i tried many different forms of ad copy or a landing page copy sending them to a page where they get just a direct video that says book a call going to a written landing page all sorts of different things again i'm always testing like a zillion different things but you can see now that i know the message that works i put the copy and so then what i see is okay we used to have one out of 100 people buy and that was profitable until about 100 a day but now uh once we got the 500 a day we need to have two out of 100 people buy and now that we are at a thousand dollars a day we need to have three out of 100 that buy your conversions have to go up with your ads because what happens again like i talked about in the last video when it comes to ad targeting is your ad targeting gets more broad you have a really targeted person you're targeting right here at about a hundred dollars a day it's kiddie pool targeting as you get to 500 a day you break out of the kiddie pool and you start having to actually convince people to buy your product and so this is why you're messaging copy comes into play and this is why if you want to scale you don't optimize your bids you optimize the process people are going through one thing at a time in your funnels and this will go and say okay cool now we have enough profitability to get to 500 a day and let's say we want to get to 2 000 a day we can take the same audiences and facebook if you have an audience of millions of people like lookalike audiences you're not going to hit ad fatigue right here okay trust me you are going to get at about two thousand dollars a day i'm not 100 sure the exact reach but you're not even coming close to getting all that million people to see your ad twice in a month okay so what's really happening right here while your ads are falling apart it's not because your bidding strategies are not good it's because people are coming to the page and they're not opting in and they're not responding at a high enough rate and people again will also respond at a higher rate right here because they're super targeted as you get up here the response rates get much lower therefore your ads start to fall apart that's why you need to keep going and tweaking these things as your ad so that your ads don't fall apart okay and so if we have a person coming to our pages right away let's imagine it's just a landing page we send people to a sales video we want to interact with them in the sales message in a way that delivers the right message and is the most optimal copy and so we're going to play around with that and really your barrier to scaling isn't ever going to be again some complicated ad straights it's going to be finding out the right copy combination the right sales message and and then the same thing is going to come with your sales page copy maybe you're sending people directly to a sales page let's say like we had a webinar page or a video sales letter page right here well then there's going to come to the point where you actually need to start selling this could be example of your e-commerce page this could be the people closing on the phone this could be your closing message in your webinar whatever okay what we're tweaking right is let's imagine this is a call funnel okay i'm talking about five different funnels at once so it can be a little bit confusing but let's imagine i'm tweaking a call funnel right here first thing i'm going to look at is how my ad message and copy is doing by looking at the reflection the then they land on this landing page right here where there's a sales message and i'm going to see how that's working by looking at the cost per call of course i'm going to use this in context because cpl affects my cost per call okay so obviously if my cost per call is 200 but i improve my opt-in rate by a hundred percent i'm going to see that cost per call go to 100 but then if i don't change the opt-in and i go and play with this stuff right here and i see it go from 100 to 75 dollars all right now i'm unlocking a little bit more scale then what i'm gonna then do let's imagine we're getting people on phone calls as i'm gonna go and help my sales reps close at a higher rate so that we are able to maximize the roi per phone call so maybe we're only making 300 per phone call originally well if we get it up to 500 suddenly my ad numbers start working and i can scale a lot further even though my cost per lead is going up and even though my cost per call is going up okay because i keep driving these things down and this is how you you scale you don't scale by doing again i've said this a billion times little optimizations in the ad manager you scale by tweaking these numbers and constantly pushing these down with optimization that's the big breakthrough that nobody gets because everybody will just go and they'll just have the same exact funnel and they won't play with any of these dials they won't play with any of these dials and they're going to be looking at their ctr on their cpc those things don't matter your cpc is reflection of your ad messaging copy okay and all those things sum up by the cpl or how people originally respond when they come to the page and so you tweak all these things and that's how you keep forcing your ads to go higher and higher these are the dials you tweak when you're scaling and so i wanted to make this video for you really quickly because this is how you should look at your funnel you should be looking instead of looking at your let's say you're doing an e-commerce funnel or something like that all right we got an ad that we're running and we have our ad which is the add message and add copy and then we just got a direct sales page and let's say your cost per sale you want to get it's too high your cost per sale is too high your roi in the ads is overall bad okay so what do we do we don't go and play with our bids what we do is we say all right if my roi is low it must mean that something in the ad message the ad copy or the sales page is off so what i'm going to do is i'm going to find the add and ad copy and the sales page combination that gets the best result and that's going to actually increase my roi and so what can we do right here well first off we can see the add message in the ad copy that gets the highest sales amount without us changing the sales page that's a very easy way to see that and then what we can do is we can match the sales page to this message then we're going to see another boost in results you see i just did that i find the add message and add copy that's going to get me the highest roi because we're getting the most amount of people coming to the sales page obviously that's going to increase my okay the most interest and then when we see which ad message that copy generates the most interest we alter the sales we make our benefits about our product say it's an e-commerce product about what the message and ad copy was about boom we see another bumping conversion boom we just unlocked a bunch of other that's how you go and optimize your ads to scale a lot further that's the video for today and the one thing i want to show you just very very super quickly this isn't a pitch for hires but if i actually just go in here and load up my harrow stats the most important thing that i need to see is these cost per calls the cost per lead everything that's coming in and i load up pyrus you can see that i can't see my cost per call you can see right here i'm doing actually really well in these ads facebook isn't catching anything okay this is just chronic with anything you're doing especially webinar call funnels or e-commerce funnels especially if multiple traffic sources is going to get sent to the wrong source and if you don't know literally where every single one of your calls is coming from you can't optimize around these things you're just going to keep getting wonky data that could be accurate could be not and then you're optimizing around all sorts of goofy stuff and if you're optimizing around goofy stuff you're going to get really goofy results so i'm telling you right now if you've watched up to this point just go book a high-risk optimization call below so we can get you hooked in here again we have a 90-day refund guarantee on it so if you hop on the hi-ros and
