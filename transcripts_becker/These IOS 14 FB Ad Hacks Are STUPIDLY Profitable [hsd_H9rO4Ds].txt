================================================================================

so non-stop on the hyrus forum i've seen people saying ah that's ruined my ads my ads are ruined to the ios i can't target anymore and they're all doing it in that same overly deep voice it's a really weird place there even even the girls there are talking in that voice maybe that's just in my head when i read the comments anyways look here's the deal i'm going to show you a bunch of things that are going to make your ads perform a lot better on facebook during ios it actually doesn't come down to any advanced changes or anything i'm just showing you different audiences and just little tweaks i've made that i've seen much bigger improvements from and frankly have allowed my ads to be doing a little bit better actually than before ios came now of course using hieros using attribution metrics i'm still able to see my attribution super clearly and so i'm not really going to be focusing on that if you're having trouble seeing your ad results or making good decisions just get hiros we literally guarantee you're going to see a 15 to 20 increase in your eye just use it for that i'm talking more about audiences and targeting and so without further ado i don't think that this video needs a big intro do you let's just get into it okay guys so we're looking at one of my smaller ad accounts right here and i use this a lot for testing but it shows the same thing i'm seeing in other ad accounts so let's go look at what's going on here the first thing i've really noticed after this update is that look-alike audiences are really outperforming just standard targeting audiences now this was kind of the case before this isn't something that you know hasn't existed but if you look right here you know are our base audiences which are going to be the the standard targetings we're talking about like targeting shopify targeting people that run paid ads i'll even show you let's say i'm using just a basic good old bare bones chimpanzee audience like marketo okay super duper basic audience this was doing really well uh before the update okay so if we go back and look at the campaigns this was doing great now look everybody has and acts like they understand exactly why this is happening and i'm going to be straight up transparent with you could be a whole range of things obviously the most basic thing that's happening is facebook just simply isn't able to target the way they used to especially when it comes to list of people okay retargeting was something that took a a big old doozy but if we go look at like let's just say the last 14 days right here you can see this is really it's really increased a lot for me while my look-alike audiences have gone down a lot okay and you can even see the past few days you know this hasn't been great now comparatively for me this this is still a great cost per call for me this is absolutely fine i'm just referring to this and again we're using facebook's conversions right here nine out of 10 times i'm going to be using high-risk conversions for these because facebook is just wildly inaccurate with their conversions they over report like crazy due to view throughs okay that's one thing you need to be looking out more and i guess i'll just talk about it right now look whenever you go and actually look at your actual metrics especially if you have a business with crisscrossing ads it wasn't this bad before in fact facebook under reported a lot in the past it seems like their over reporting has gone insane now is this because they want to still seem like they're getting good results i don't really know but i've seen over reporting on facebook just get the silly levels like right here i can track where every single call on highrose came from i can click right here and i'm not going to load it up in this video because you've probably seen me do it a thousand times other videos but i can see people's entire click history every ad they've interacted with all the devices they're using a lot of times when you have crisscrossing businesses especially businesses that have a lot of organic traffic like hyrus does you're going to start seeing a lot of over reporting in facebook so again you need to be super careful with this because it's gotten to a level that's like inappropriately high recently from my point of view now the next thing i've seen that's really helped a lot and improved results is creating bigger look-alike audiences so if i go and move that down you're going to see and again we're going to be echoing off of facebook numbers right here which are not really that accurate these numbers are the cost recall is a little bit higher on all of these that being said i've been getting really good results by increasing to the five percent and i'm trying to go up to the seven percent in that range now with our lookalike audiences because i think what's also happening right here is facebook just literally has smaller lists to work with when they were able to target people on apps and for people on phones and all the things that are being cracked down on they just had larger lists of people so you had more people you could run ads to i think in order to make facebook work a little bit better you need to give facebook a larger list of people to be targeting because they can still find people can still use its conversion targeting to do pretty well there especially if you're passing that data back from an attribution tool but one thing that just worked a lot better for me is just increasing the audience sizes and i want to show you one thing that's worked really bad for me is in the past i used to really want these ad sets to only target the people that i want to target okay so i would usually block exclusions i wouldn't have uh i wouldn't give facebook the ability to go way outside the interest range that i put in there i every campaign that i've had the interest range blocked on has done a lot worse than ones that haven't now the final thing i'm going to lay out there as well is having customer list and using customer lists primarily for retargeting which i'm doing a lot of right now has just been working a lot better than say retargeting people to just bump onto my page or something like that it's it's a simple statement to make but i've really used to focus more on website retargeting and list retargeting has just been working a lot better so if you have an email list you're collecting emails you're collecting actual customer data i think that gives google i think that gives facebook a lot better direction to target than simply using the website retargeting which is again being a little bit messed up by ios because again it's not tracking people landing on apps because again a big chunk of facebook's targeting and audience collection via pixels has been knocked out a little bit by the ios update so that's another thing right there now just a few things i think you should really look at with your ads because what i constantly see people try and do is they try to find the reason why their ads aren't working but you have to think what what's going to happen if you find the reason why your ads aren't working you're probably not going to be able to fix it because facebook is just going to keep working like it's working right now the end the most important thing you could do is improve your ads so let me give you a few things that i've done and have really helped out one of the things that's helped out the most and i'm doing it in this campaign right now so you can kind of see what i'm doing is reducing the amount of ads inside of ad groups now you might not have this problem but when i've done this i've seen it do a lot better okay so what i do is i just go and clear the ads that are kind of a messy right there sometimes people like to have like seven different ads in there i'm really finding that at around three to four ads that's when we're kind of getting the best the best results on top of that check out this video ad right here this thing has done extremely well for me lately and if you just apply these things to your ads even without changing the scripts even without changing the copy you're probably going to start seeing better results so check out this ad right here on this corner this thing has got me significantly better results than my other ads but it has the same exact ad script copy everything so with your ads make sure when you're running video ads first off those are what are doing better on facebook right now i'm not usually seeing image ads do better on the cold targeting side on the retargeting site i see image ads do much better because all you're trying to do is remind people there's just a general tip right there that can help you with your ads right now on top of that when you have a video ad what's the thumbnail look like okay is there a clear hook text wise in the thumbnail okay is there an image that stands out so check this out this is this is this is important when it comes to advertising if you go and compare this ad to this ad right here that's over here i know i'm scrolling around no man's land the other ad starts off with a blurry uh image of a non-unique thumb drive okay so i took that ad i put an iron man thumb drive that stands out especially from the background you can see there's a lot of bright lights and everything but it's blurry in the background super focused on this catches the eye person reads it this is so important when it comes to video ads simply making changes like this on my ads and thinking how are people going to scroll past and how can i grab their attention more effectively has plummeted a lot of my cost per calls because more people are clicking the ad more people are paying attention and so if you really want to do well in this update to do those things i just talked about improve the audience size start focusing a little bit more on look-alike audiences particularly of buyers buyer look like audiences have been doing very very very well for me go through your ads and look at where you can simply improve them by dropping 20 to 30 percent of your costs on ads simply by making better headlines making better video thumbnails making sure the video stands out this ai tracking extremely clear text right here you can see you can you maybe can't see it in this video right has extremely clear text okay i used a subtitle generation software that is facebook's not going to give you this clear of text you want to make the video have this right here having that right there having strong call to actions focusing on using the scripts that i talk about on this channel as well my exact youtube and facebook ad scripts are on this channel that's going to improve your ads well enough that you're not going to eat maybe the amount of doodoo you're already eating on this update i see a lot of people struggling and the reason why there's all sorts of things we can talk about facebook's lack of targeting or can't get the results it did before i'm doing just fine our ads are doing just fine and we're getting actually lower cost per calls now because i put even more effort into my ads i think what is mainly going on is the list of people that facebook can accurately target is much smaller than before so it's getting more competitive ad cost is increasing give facebook larger list to work with and make sure your ads are better because it's more competitive now because it can't target as many people as accurately as it used to be that's it i think a lot of people with uncompetitive ads are paying the price for not having competitive ads that's it that's all for today guys i mean obviously another tip i could give you but i give it every every video too use attribution use something like hirose if you're not working off the correct data from your attribution you're going to lose 15 to 20 of your ad spend you're going to kill campaigns that you should be scaling cutting another 15 to 20 of profit off your ad account if you just fix your attribution have accurate data you don't have that and that really helps a lot an extra 30 in margins is really useful when you're scaling up ads that was being said guys if you want to see as well being said check out all the tutorials and courses on this channel all my facebook copywriting on my youtube
