================================================================================

ladies gents and goblins it is it is the final video is the final video of this series this video i'm going to be walking you through 50 a day scale 200 a day scale 500 ish a day scale and then blowing past a thousand dollars a day scale all the way up to five thousand dollars a day scale and what i'm going to break down in this video is what you should be looking at at each point and if you follow this you're consistently not going to blow up your ads and what usually happens when people scale is their cpl their cpa or their costs acquire customer goes to the roof something explodes and then people don't know what it is it's because when you hit certain points ad scale something is usually going to go wrong because your ad is not competent enough to go to that next level of scale if you know where to look at this you can actually prevent this from happening in the first place or you can address the issue before you keep trying to scale what most people try and do is they get to a certain point and they just keep hitting it over and over and over again thinking that there's some audience or some bidding strategy that's blocking them it's not how it works at certain levels of scale certain types of things are going to go wrong with your ads and there's going to be very common things that you can fix to allow you to break to that next point because really what scaling is is just keeping your ads profitable while going into broader audiences that are more expensive to target that's literally all it is and if you know how to work in these broader audiences while making your ads more and more profitable and more optimized that's how you scale you scale by optimizing the funnel the offer the ad copy not by optimizing weird little bidding things i'm going to show you exactly where to look at each level scale in this video so let's get into it okay guys so this video is again all about scaling all about the scaling getting those big juicy huge scale numbers 15 025 no that's not what this is about at all look the first thing we need to cover in this video is there is no honor in spending tons of money on ads okay i in fact make much more profit now my margins are much much higher spending 2 to 3k a day extremely efficiently efficiently than sometimes when i've been spending 15 to 20k a day okay that's the first thing we need to talk about in this video this is priority number one it's all about the profit margins or the intended goal okay now i'm going to dive into my ad account i'm actually going to show you a lot of my numbers and really exactly how i bid but it's actually quite simple if you understand the key concepts of how scaling actually happens and again just like the last video doesn't come down to a secret bidding technique or like increasing your bids or budget by point two cents a day to like trick to facebook algorithm and just thinking that you are i don't know barack obama okay well you'd be like this is barack dude he's bidding in a certain way we got to give him the big bucks the big the good customers give them all the good ones okay so or donald trump if that's your forte don't get political on me in these videos guys i'm just making jokes so there's a few things you need to understand first and foremost number one is that when you are scaling from 100 500 let's go all the way up to like let's just use 5 000 a day but this applies in almost any range okay once you get past a thousand dollars a day all the audiences start behaving very similar so let's say we get an audience to a thousand bucks a day and so on and so forth you understand that why your numbers usually fall apart isn't because of your targeting it isn't because you're targeting at all because frankly if you get to look like audiences and let's say you get to about three percent look alike audiences the audience is going to be three to five million people depending of all the countries you have in there in order to reach three to five million people you're gonna be needing to spend at least around ten thousand dollars a day on ads really consistently be showing uh these people the ads over and over and over again at any level of consistency usually what happens when people's ad roi starts going down they assume it's ad fatigue and they go and make new ads uh and and try and do just basically new ads that's what i usually see and while changing out your ads does help sometimes it's rarely the long term answer and you should really get to the point with your ads when you're targeting audiences this big that your ads will work for a very long time now that's not me saying that your first ad should work for a very long time it usually takes about a hundred ads in an ad account to get to the point where you have five ads that consistently work having an ad that like really hits the ball out of the park they're rare it's about one in 20 and that's fine okay if you go look through my ad account i've i think i'm at like 60 ads now and i have four to consistently work really really well right now and there's no rhyme or reason behind which ones work and which ones don't so you just need to constantly be adding new ads into the mix when i was running hcom when we scaled to about 20 000 a day i could just consistently run the same three to five ads and the cpl and metrics would stay about the same of course they would always gradually trend upward because that's just what happens with ads but i didn't have to change my ads very consistently once we hit that level and i had tested about 50 different ads and then about three to five this consistently works so drop that whole ad fatigue thing it's not because of ad fatigue at your ads won't scale what does happen as we get from 100 to 500 to a thousand dollars a day on an ad set or a specific audience is you go from again the kiddie pool that i talked about in previous videos to being in a more broad pool to just being in a super broad pool and what usually happens on facebook is people have a very targeted offer with a message that won't survive in this area right here so they try to do all these different things and they can never really scale past 5000 bucks a day if that's their goal because the message of the offer doesn't work and i talked about message a ton in the last video so i'm not going to talk about it right now but the way you scale from 100 to 500 to 1000 a day is you keep tweaking the message to reach the broadest audience as possible it's not targeting let me show you this here is one ad right here where i'm consistently getting hundred dollar calls this is phenomenal at high risk because i am massively profitable at 400 calls okay now if i go and look at the same audiences right here let's just go look at this audience right here hi rose let's just look at the best performing audience the last seven days okay um so if i go look at this audience right here so let's look at the science right here it's just doing really great seventy three dollar calls that's juicy for me hiro's two percent calls okay and so this is targeting a audience and this is not this is a call funnel i realized that the same thing applies in e-commerce the same thing applies with mass info or course sales it's the same thing across the entire board i'm going to give you some more objectives when it comes to scaling right here in fact this entire video is just me spilling pearls of wisdom that are going to help you scale and get much higher roi in your ad spend there's really no actual plan with this video i'm just going to tell you all the cool tricks and stuff i know so check this out uh it's a look-alike audience of hiros calls mid-year so if i go and look at this same exact audience and this campaign that i've actually turned off right here let's go hi-ros okay you can see it's 300 cost per calls and you can see right here with the signs right here high risk customers three percent i'm like netting 500 cost per calls right here whereas on this one right here you can see the past few days i'm actually getting like 79 cost per calls it's all about the message of the ad okay 100 40 cost per call is what i'm averaging right here i'm getting 500 on the other one and the reason for that is because i really focused on tweaking how the funnel works and how the person interacts with the ad and how the person gets the phone call and the message of the sales video and the message of the ad and so you can see if the same exact audience right there i'm getting significantly better numbers and look at 400 a day i can scale but i want to see like 10xrys in my ads because i'm incredibly greedy with high risk because it's such a great offer and so the thing you need to understand right here is that it's it's usually not an audience thing it's a message thing and now the next tip i'm going to show you is i scale a very specific way i increase my bids based on the results but the most important thing i need to tell you for very quickly is for love of all things good and gravy i've talked about this six times in every single video so i'm not going to talk about too long right here track your ads with something if you don't want to use hi-ros go use wiki reports go combine something with segment i don't care what you're doing do not use ad platform tracking to make your decisions this is the world's simplest funnel right here where the person just clicks in and books a call and i'm still looking look two calls right here on this one right here it looks like this is a dud audience it didn't catch any calls this one right here two calls caught one looks like a dud audience it would be 300 cost per call if i wasn't tracking this correctly this one right here reported three calls because of view through conversions and how it tracks things or maybe a person clicked an ad on google and that and google actually got credit because again i have multiple traffic sources running you might probably be too since it's an advanced course and so you're going to have organic traffic running you're going to have google ads running and then you're going to have facebook ads running and facebook is going to give itself credit or it might give itself view through conversions and if you were scaling based on that you were scaling on incorrect data and this shouldn't be shocking to anybody but when you scale on incorrect data you spend money on ads that don't actually make you money you kill ads that are making you money when you do both of those things consistently you are going to waste lots of money and kill your scale prematurely and you're going to not have ads that are as profitable as they should be because when you track your ads properly you make better decisions people that make better decisions get a higher roi on their ads again you can see this right here i have my hi-ros data i have my high-risk tracking data pulled up right here you can see here's an ad set right here doing quite well reported no conversions doing quite well 84 calls holy moly not reporting it if i turn off these ads right here i'm turning off my best sources of calls and then finally last of all scale around roi it takes a little bit of time for my calls to come in sales to come in but i can even already see my roi in these platforms if you're doing a call funnel if you're doing a webinar funnel you're doing something as a long click to sale time if you're not scaling around roi you're bonkers okay and so this is the things i'm going to be making my decisions off of if you want the same tracking like this go below just book a consultation with hiros i'm not trying to pitch you or sell you in these videos i just don't know how to give you scaling advice if you're not using correct data it would be like me giving you stock investing advice with incorrect stock data like i wouldn't tell you to invest in something if the numbers i was basing my investment advice on were wrong would i same thing book a consultation below but then once i have that data right there what i'm going to do is scale like this i'm i usually start audiences at about 100 bucks a day if it's a big audience okay if it's a big eye and says there were a million people 100 000 people and i'm just going to kick it at 100 a day you can start at 50 to 100 whatever you want to do some people start at 20 and that's way too small to see data quickly if you're starting off this is an advanced ad course so that's why i'm not starting off with five dollar a day bidding or anything like that because the truth is if i want to scale quickly and i put it five dollars a day it's gonna take me twenty dollars a day it's going to take me 20 days to figure out what i could have figured out in one day at 100 a day now that concept doesn't work if i kicked it out at a thousand dollars because the audience might get blown out and that means where the message of the ad loses traction okay so where the ad will actually perform and be profitable it could maybe at three hundred dollars a day five hundred dollars a day one thousand dollars a day could hit blowout so what blowout is is let's imagine we have the ad and it's working we're getting great cpls great cpas whatever our acquisition cost says it's profitable you've probably noticed at a certain point of scale it blows out and then it stops working all your numbers go to hell what we're trying to do with scale is find this number right here find the blowout area and then we're going to go and work on our messaging to increase the blowout area that's really all scaling is now to find the blowout area what you want to do is if you're at sub 250 a day or sub 200 a day around this range right here you increase by double each day so i'm at 50 a day what i'm going to do is i'm going to scale based off of if i'm in e-commerce profitability roi because i'm going to see my my rois right away if i'm doing a webinar or a call funnel i'm going to scale based off cpl now i'm not going to optimize around cpl with my ads i'm just going to use cpl as a rough number if i see a good decent number right here i'm going to use that and then if i'm doing a call funnel what i'm eventually going to look for mainly is going to be cost per call and we can usually get the cost per call pretty quickly okay you could see like today i'm not scaled up too far with our ads we're only at like 2 000 bucks a day and i'm seeing my cost per calls coming in just fine okay so we can usually detect cost per call pretty early with a webinar funnel sometimes you're only going to get like one or two sales when you're in a testing period you have a two thousand dollar product or something like that so eventually the webinar funnel you're gonna wanna purely scale off of roi that's gonna be your end decision maker but i usually like to go off of the opt-in while not optimizing for the opt-in okay this opt-in is like basically if you have a video game store the opt-in would be people coming in to play the free demos okay the year old kids who come in completely broke to play demos all day aren't going to buy something we want to optimize by the people that actually buy the games and if we then go and see that the cpl is good for them then we want to go around that and usually you're going to do better not even optimizing for anything but i talked about that last video so let's go check that out so we're going to double up every single time we see a good result so i'm going to go 50 to 100 100 to 200 and then when i get about 200 i'm going to increase by 50 each day so 200 to 300. 300 to 450 okay then when i get to about 450 500 i'm gonna increase by 25 every single day so 500 to 600. and this depends this is not always an always absolute thing sometimes if the numbers look amazing i'll just bump it from like 500 to 800 500 to a thousand it depends okay if there's like zero resistance of scale because what you're going to see is your cpa whatever your key metric is going to be as you start to climb you're going to tell where the blow it is going to start to occur at because you're going to go from like 100 to 200 a day and then you go from a five dollar cpl to a seven dollar cpl sometimes you go to 100 to 250 a day and you go from like a five to like a four because it gets a bit more optimized you're like oh okay cool this is good maybe you go to 200 to 400 and it still stays at four to five dollars okay that's still good then you go from 400 to 800 and still stays you got a big audience and your message is working really well at that point okay so that's what we're looking for we're looking for that blowout point where it goes from being stable to blowing up the same thing happens on adwords and facebook check out our adwords youtube scaling course if you want to check that out and also if you want help with your ads and you just want to hop on a call with me and get a consultation i'll look at your ads tell you where you could be scaling a lot more there's a link to my mastermind consultation below you should you should check it out if anything we can hop in a call talk about your ads and how to scale now finally i want to talk about the things that allow you to scale much further besides that increasing of the bids so your first objective when you start this up is you want to get a lookalike audience of buyers this is pretty difficult to do if you're doing a call funnel or a webinar funnel which has a long click to sale time but if you have a lower ticket item like e-commerce you want to get to 100 sales as fast as possible so you can then go and make a look like audience because that's usually going to be your best audience but you want to make look-alike audiences based on all sorts of actions your opt-ins your abandoned carts if you're doing e-commerce your calls and those are usually what i'm going to operate around you don't want to make look-alike audiences based on visits because that's just wonky because a visitor isn't technically anything though you can sometimes do that but test it test the audience that's the first thing you really want to shoot for if you're doing a webinar make you look like audience based around opt-ins don't optimize for opt-ins but you can make a look-alike audience around them if you're doing the call funnel lookalike audience around your opt-ins and then your calls as soon as possible and then it's gonna take a while for webinar and call funnel but you want to then take your customers once you have 100 of them make it look like around that that's going to help you out a ton okay also when it comes to scaling with webinars and call funnels webinars is almost better you don't optimize for anything why because what's going to happen is if you optimize for opt-ins you optimize for freebie seekers you don't optimize for buyers call funnels i optimize for the call and not the opt-in ever in fact if you optimize for the opt-in you will get worse results and if you don't use any targeting uh or optimization period so don't do that that's my results you can go ahead and test it disprove me but i don't think i'll be wrong in that case in most instances next if you want to scale further you need to determine what your long-term best metrics are so sometimes if you're running an e-commerce funnel and you have a deep funnel where you have other products people come back and buy it's completely okay to scale while breaking even it's completely okay to scale while losing money for example i built a million dollar per month business while losing 20 percent up front on the ads then we would make it back for x over three to four months as payment plans and additional sales came in you have to look at everything in context and really the way that you're going to scale the furthest with your ads is once you get to about a thousand dollars a day on an audience you're going against people that really focus on the long term with their ads they're willing to lose money up front to make the money back three to four months later okay and the most profitable businesses they 10x their roi on their ads but they usually don't make much money up front okay for example click funnels one of the things russell brunson did is he didn't make much money on the ads he'd break even getting people buying and he'd get buyers into the business and then he would get them on click funnels where they get them reoccurring subscriptions and buy his mastermind and all sorts of other things okay so we'd actually lose money right here and so if you want to run your ads you need to understand you're going to be running against people like this and eventually when you get to a large scale this is who you're playing against and so you need to play a much more long-term game so it's completely okay if you're scaling to lose money as long as you understand why you're losing money and what's going on here so for example if i was losing money on that other ad set where i showed you where i was paying 500 a call that's not good that's not good scaling okay and i'm not going to find the number right here again that's not good now that i have my number super optimized and i've improved my message i can scale with that and if i'm get to the point where i'm breaking even with that funnel and that optimization that's fine because i'm getting tons of customers in tons of interest in building a massive retargeting list for hirose and when a customer comes in at high risk if i lose 100 percent up front so so let's say i get them on and this is just hypothetical numbers if i get them on 100 a month account and it costs me 200 to do that that's still wonderful because i'm going to be 800 profitable by the end of the year or more if we're actually doing real math and counting months about a thousand dollars profit and so you need to look at your long-term metric right there it's completely okay in e-commerce or even webinar funnels or call funnels to break even while gaining tons of people into your business and getting them indoctrinated and then you make money long term and that's really the biggest key i can give you for scaling is look at the long term numbers of the business and then play off those numbers because it's so easy to run ads that are 10x profitable over a year so easy to run ads like this it is so difficult to run ads that are three to four x profitable at scale constantly and i mean three to four x profitable cash so you spend ten dollars you make 40 back you spend ten thousand dollars you make 40 000 back okay this is super hard and trying to do this hamstrings you big time because you're going to constantly keep hitting a cap because you're hitting people that are okay spending ten thousand to make ten thousand but those people that spend ten thousand make ten thousand are usually going to make a hundred thousand off that ten thousand because they focus on the long-term funnel okay and usually what's more profitable is not going hambone the second person comes in your business it's getting the person indoctrinated the right way and then going hambone in the back end that's what everybody does okay so these are my best scaling and bidding and growth techniques guys this is the end of the course this is the end of the facebook series i don't have really anything that i can add to it this is basically everything i do um besides me literally just hopping over the shoulder and working with you on your ads by the way if you want that check out the link below in the description you can copy a free consultation with me we'll look at your ads how to grow if you're good fit for my mastermind too you can get invited to join that same exact thing with hieros again if you're running ads and trying to scale up ads with incorrect data i don't i don't know what to tell you okay if you take me being the ceo of hiroshima use something okay use wic reports use segment use something to track your ads nothing's as accurate as highers but if you just want to like take my bias out of it and just say no i'm going to do the opposite of what you tell me do use something because if you're scaling around wrong data and then feeding that data back to your ai and the whole entire thing it's just a mess you can go schedule a demo with us below we'll show you the tracking works show you where you can improve your ads by the way with 90 day guarantee on it so if you don't see results that allow you to scale further you don't pay for it so there's no risk to checking us out and booking a call worst thing that's going to happen is you'll be like oh okay maybe i'll get this in the future i'm not ready for this or you could just completely scale your ads in a whole other direction there's plenty of people that double and triple their businesses once they hop on the highrose that being said guys this has been the facebook course if you want more content like this as well check out our youtube course which is linked below as well it's again free and it's just as detailed as this if not more and i'm
