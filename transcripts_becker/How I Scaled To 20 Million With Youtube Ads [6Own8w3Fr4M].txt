hirolians it's becker let's talk youtube ads this is a big mystery for a lot of people and in this video i'm just going to tell you and show you the best way to start a youtube ad campaign and then scale it up let's say to a thousand bucks a day if you follow what's in this video youtube ads are gonna be really easy i think it's the best traffic source especially for broad traffic if you have an offer that's under two thousand dollars i think this is the best place for you to start looking at because it scales so well and you get such a broad reach when it comes to audiences you can just blow it up like that so what i want to do in this video is show you the exact type of targeting and audiences and type of ads you should run when you're starting it up and show you exactly how i start all my campaigns that's it you might be wondering alex what's the catch here's the catch i want you to make more money from your ads because when you make more money from your ads you're probably going to want to make even more money the best way to do this to track your ads with hiros and then when you combine this information with hiros you're going to make tons more money and upgrade your hires account and therefore we'll make more money at highrose so it's in our best interest just tell you everything i know so let's get into it so let's just keep this nice and simple i'm just going to dive straight into my adwords account and what i want to do is i want to show you some of my best targetings my best scaling strategies and kind of give you some insights on the type of ads i run though if you go below on the blog there's literally a link to a post where i break down my exact ad script that i've been using for years there's no opt-in there's no anything i'm just giving it to you i've been using this across webinars it's generated well over about 30 million dollars in sales are closing in on that at this point before we also get the scaling strategies as well i just need to point this out too because i don't know how you can scale without this because i couldn't you can see right now i have the hi-ros chrome extension loaded up right now so i can just see my actual print tracking results this is what hirose essentially does it allows me to actually track things that weren't going to get tracked by google and if you just go through here and you look at the sales calls and actual revenue coming in um this is a sales call funnel right here so of course google's not going to be able to track any of the closes like iris can but the most important thing to me right here when it comes to scaling is this calls column right here because this is going to be very similar to you whatever funnel you're running because all that's going on here with this call funnel is this the person clicks an ad they opt in and then they book a call so this is going to be similar to if you're running an e-commerce funnel if you have a webinar funnel it's going to be pretty similar because there isn't that much time between the opt-in the call and you can see when i go and look at my ads right here the calls are all over the place in google because this is because of view throughs and because of how they load up their pixel and so you can see some ads right here um they reported eight calls when there's actually six but there's actually eight thousand dollars in sales so i still want to keep that up you can see another one right here where it reports zero calls there's actually four calls and it did four thousand dollars in literal profit so i don't want to turn this ad off this would be an ad that i would just shut off instantly okay if i did that you can't scale if you have an ad that's giving you a great cost per call or a great short term conversion and a great long-term conversion you can see this one right here again four calls reported three you can see this one right here it reported absolutely zero calls for the 253 dollars spent and it actually generated me a sale uh over thirty five hundred dollar sale so about three thousand dollars in profit and i actually turned this off because i didn't have this funnel tracked with hiros until uh early this month so you can just see even in my side business right here if you're not tracking your actual stats you're going to be turning off and turning on things that you shouldn't be you're going to be increasing waste and account by so much you're going to also be turning off the ads they're going to allow you to scale so again i'm not trying to push hiros on you but my first scaling technique is you have to use accurate data because even on a funnel this simple well there's not that much time between the click and the actual conversion it's still being missed all the time and then if you want to track really long term conversions and actual ltv which is again incredibly important for scale forget about it unless you're using it so get accurate data i don't care how you do it but you need to be using accurate data when you scale your ads so i want to talk about some of my most profitable ads of all time and the targeting behind them because i see a lot of people in google ads they really over complicate it so let's just look at the cost so i'm going to walk you through some of these ads because all these ones especially these top ones right here generate at least almost a million dollars in sales on their own let me show you the targetings you should be thinking about because what i see a lot of people trying to do is they try to over complicate this they create all these different layers they do all these different things and the real secret and beauty of google ads is you can go super broad and if you know to make your broad ads the right way which again you can see in the script below this video on that blog post you can go super broad and way broader than you can go on facebook and really just target mass traffic perfect example this is one of my best audiences of all time was simply just the words make money online super broad incredibly broad audience so why this is very different than facebook because you really kind of target down so if i was doing something on on facebook or i was talking to people that want to learn the ketogenic diet or something like that i would have to target people that want to do the ketogenic diet putting in just weight loss and facebook wouldn't work too well however if you just put weight loss into google if you form your ads the right way that can work exceptionally well other audiences that have worked super well from us again you can see that it's simple audiences and even when i'm running very specific types of offers for example hirose the ads for hirose it's a very specific offer it helps people track their marketing better tracks their ad attribution better again i will still target these same types of audiences because i will then also be feeding this data back to the google ai so it knows what to look for so you can really use the google ai especially with offline conversions that target a lot better again you could do that with pyros as well again don't don't let me pitch you anything right here however when i go look at this audience right here you can see this is a giant audience the advertising and marketing ons you can see the actual size of this audience is 1 billion to 5 billion impressions weekly so it's just absolutely huge again when you're feeding the google pixel your data back via offline conversions it can make these type of audiences work because it goes and looks at this broad audience looks at all your conversions coming in and then is able to find your customers just much cheaper so the second type of audience i really like to use on top of big giant keyword audiences is these specific audiences that are based around in-market audiences and so the way you really want to figure those out is if you actually go and upload all your conversions for example into google and i just want to go look at my buyers all right so i have a big list of buyers right here or heck just people that have registered i can see some audiences at the top that i might be able to target that are in in-market audiences and if you have good offline conversion data being passed in and use these audiences these have worked super well for us especially when it comes to scaling and so this has been incredible for us to scale with affinity audiences i'm not the biggest fan of i i usually don't see as good as results as i do in market audiences however you should maybe test these as well again i don't i don't think i'm gonna do too well targeting fighting wrestling fans however there's a few of them like maybe avid business news readers that i might want to go and target the final type of audiences i really love to use and it's almost exclusively these three types of audiences that i'm showing you in this video is going to be intent audiences and the way i make intent audiences again i'm just going to use keywords big simple keywords to make these intentions the way intent audiences work is i'm just going to go how an intent audience works if i go and look at this you can create custom audiences and you can put in keywords that your target market would be searching for so the way that keyword audiences work at least from my experience google never really explains this very well and i think a lot of the ways that they work is not secretive i just don't think anybody knows except that engineers and engineers aren't sharing exactly how it works so keyword audiences are going to target people searching for that exact keyword and pages that have those keywords on them on youtube for example if i go and do antenna on inches it's going to target people that have been searching for those keywords or have been searching for similar things so when a person types in how to make money online how to make more money earn money online they get added to this intent audience it shows what they have been searching for online this works exceptionally well for me and so using those three types of audiences i just showed you that's almost exclusively how i scaled a single information offer to over multiple eight figures in sales okay well over 20 million dollars in sales and i want to show you again that was kind of a more broad offer and so if i actually go and look at like the last let's say the last seven days okay and i go and look at some of my better performing ads you're going to see i'm doing almost the same exact thing big massive broad keywords now youtube advertising isn't the biggest or massiveness massivest broad keyword but you can see i'm only putting one keyword per group i'm doing the same exact stretch and the reason why you want to do this is because if you put in multiple keywords per group what's going to happen is what you're going to see right here you're going to see that one keyword is going to dominate the entire thing you can see almost all my ad spend is going to this keyword right here i know these keywords right here get more traffic and generate more traffic than just this keyword but it's going to go to the default one that has the most the most traffic what i also like to do with my keyword audiences this is just a little tip as i like to grab the titles from youtube videos that i want to target and then throw them in there so we'll also go and target similar youtube videos you can also see what i love to do is i love to target people that watch my channel so if i have videos on specific things i'll just target people who've watched those videos that's not necessarily a cold traffic strategy but it does work very very well another thing you can do that works really well in certain niches is you can do placements now here's the key to placements a lot of people can't ever get their placements to start so i'm going to give you just a little bonus tip right here when you're doing placements what you want to do is you want to of course go and grab all your placements online so what i'm going to do is i'm not going to use channels i use actual youtube videos so i'll go search for videos on youtube and then i'll throw them all in here you can also do this by going selecting this in here and then typing in just a keyword for the video so if i typed in facebook ads now the problem with this is it sometimes gives you videos that can't be monetized you definitely want to add as many as you possibly can what i like to also do is that this isn't that great for this is i like to go and actually find trending videos with these gears on because these won't always show up first when you search for them you want to find the videos that just got put online because then you'll be able to get a placement on them that other people aren't specifically targeting for example if i type in facebook ads right here pretty much everyone and their dog who has ever wanted to advertise to marketers is targeting these videos and put a placement on these videos so the way you get these to spend and the reason why they won't spend most of time is because you want to do cost per view marketing so what does that mean it means when we go to the settings of our ad you don't want to do automated bidding which is what i do on most of my ads that works just fine what you want to do is maximum cpv and you want to crank that up okay and so that means it's going to spend as much as it possibly can to get that view and that's because most people are trying to do the minimum cpv and they're trying to do other biddings where they control it and because of that because there's so many people bidding on those very limited placements it's very competitive and so you might as well just spend what youtube is going to require you to spend that works really well for me finally other audiences that work well are intent audiences so you can see this one right here paid traffic intent has a pretty good cost per call again you can see i'm not doing anything crazy i'm using the same exact type of strategies that i did before okay so you can see i'm just targeting the keyword paid traffic facebook ads google ads how to advertise advertise ads youtube ads and so that worked really well for me as and so these audiences i this is my side business not our main highros ads and so i'm not going to be giving away all my targeting and everything that i use for hire sites but you can see my strategies and how i think about things overall and this is what i've used to scale a straight up broad offer to multi-figures and sales this is also what i've used to scale a very targeted b2b offer which is hirose and then also a bdb offer which is our youtube ad consulting program iron which i kind of do as a side business and so what i'm going to do when it comes to scaling on youtube is first off i'm going to use the ad strategies and add templates that you can see below this video alright there's going to be a bunch of ad templates you can use you can check them out it's going to show you exactly how i write my ads i'm not going to talk about this video because there's literally a 20 minute video that walks you through all my best converting ads of all time okay so check that out below when you get done here but when i scale what i'm going to do to start off my ads and then scale my ads is i'm going to start with these intent audiences these end market audiences these single keyword audiences max cpv placements and that's really where i'm going to stop at if i have an offer that applies to people that watch my youtube channel which for example my youtube channel is mostly self-help and motivation this point so it doesn't really do very well with iron or high rose ads it doesn't do that well doesn't kill it if i open up a beginner make money online offer or a self-help offer it would kill it so make sure the people watching your channel are relevant to it's not just going to work because people know you so you can do retargeting with people that watch your youtube channel and that that can work really well as you can also do look-alike audiences which are called similar audiences on youtube and those will be automatically generated for you and you can go and reach those just by going if i go look at these ads right here i'm going to go to audiences and then you can go browse your audiences and they'll be automatically created whenever you make any type of list there is so if i go look at youtube users you can see that i can go and select people that are similar people that view my channel or similar people that have bought something in the past however these similar audiences are way more hidden miss than the lookalike audiences on facebook okay so you have to understand that about them as well they sometimes work they sometimes don't usually the broader your offer the better they work it doesn't necessarily work that amazingly well for a call offer i really like just intent keyword audiences and really passing that offline conversion data back uh to adwords using hiros that's absolutely key for call offers or really specific offers so that being said what i'm going to do when i start these off is i'm just going to put 30 a day on all of these you can use you can use less than that if you want i i don't because i can frankly test things i rather get testing done quickly instead of spending five dollars a day and waiting a week to see if something works or not so i'm gonna do is i'm gonna put 30 a day on all of these if it's a e-commerce offer or straight to sale offer i want to see the results right away if i spend 30 bucks my my product is 20 i want to see a few conversions at least on that 30 bucks or at least one or two conversions let me know i'm on the right track if it's a webinar what i'm going to do is i'm going to look at my cpl okay so i'm going to make sure that i have at least if i'm going broad with webinar which is the only time you should be using webinars on youtube you don't want to i'll talk about how to do b2b on youtube here in a second but i want to see about a four uh the seven dollar cpl of a person opting in the webinar that's when i know i'm going to do pretty good right there and of course cpl doesn't really matter you want to look at the actual sales and the reason why you want to do that is again here's a perfect example cpl isn't really that relevant of a stat sales are a relevant stat you can see most of the time google's not going to catch your sales on a webinar for example here's a webinar one of the ones i scaled to eight figures you can see most of the time the revenue that was tracked by us and the revenue it was reported by google is way off right it missed a 2 000 sale here miss a sale here missed a sale here missed a sell here out of 22 high ticket sales google was only able to catch i believe in this example about 11 of them so if i'm scaling based on that data and only looking at cpu i'm gonna do all sorts of crazy stuff like scaling ads that have great cpl but no sales and i would be killing ads that have a bad cpl or a bad cost per lead and have great sales so data especially with webinars and call funnels holy moly now if i'm going to be doing a call funnel what i'm going to look at is again i'm going to look at the cpl and then because it's a little bit easier to get calls and it is a webinar sale you don't have to be as long-term focused i'm going to look at that cost per call as well okay but usually for b2b offers i want to see a 150 or at least for my offers 150 to 300 cost per call and if i see that on that i know it kind of works but again i want to look at the overall conversions of the ad and make sure it's making me long term because i can i can tell you all sorts of times i've seen people bidding getting a great cost per call spending tens of thousands of dollars on calls look great cost per call wise and then no sales are generated so it's like hey all your calls are actually coming from another ad with the more expensive cost per call so i'm going to put 30 on all these and when i see good cpls on webinars and call funnels i'm going to start cranking up maybe the 50 to 80 a day when i start seeing a good cost per call i'm going to crank it up a little bit more and then when i start seeing sales and an roi i'm that's when i'm really going to start cranking it up now the way i'm going to go and increase my ad spend is i'm going to go from if it's sub 250 a day i'm just going to increase 100 so 30 to 60 60 to 120 120 to 240 okay because you're not gonna you're not going to max out or burn out your ads too quickly doing that you're not going to hit the peak on many ad sets now past 240 a day that's when you start to hit the peak on audiences on adwords at least some of the time so i'm going to increase by 50 at that point so i'm going to go 240 to 360. okay and if cpl and cost per call hold i'm going to go 360 to around 500 so i'm going to increase by 40 50 percent every single day then what i'm going to do once i get past 500 days i'm going to increase by 25 every day now i'm not going to use hard math right here because i'm not going to do it but if i was going right here i go from maybe 500 to 650 a day 650 to maybe 800 a day 800 to a thousand dollars a day and i'm just going i'm going to usually increase by 25 until the cpl goes crazy that's usually your best indicator on webinars and call funnels if you're maxing out the audience if the cpl goes crazy you either need to lower it back down or you need to improve your ads and your opt-in rates okay cpl is not the end-all it doesn't it's not the only thing that matters but if your cpl goes from five dollars to 15 you're going to see your cost per call go up you're going to see your conversions go down just by default that literally you're paying three times more per lead okay and so the thing you also need to realize is let's imagine we're at 500 a day and then we go to a thousand dollars a day and we see a five dollar to 15 increase i see people do this all the time they brag about their ad spend but they're not actually tracking their their sales or whatnot that's the first thing i see people they're not tracking their long-term sales a perfect example is this when i was scaled up to about twenty five thousand dollars a day i could have actually reduced by about ten thousand dollars a day and kept the same roi and that was because i wasn't tracking my actual sales so just keep that in mind but next if you go 500 to 1000 a day and your cpl triples you're actually getting less people in here than you are here so you got to keep that in mind as well and so that's what to look for so those are the audiences i use that's the scaling strategies and how i bid and if you want to look at the ad templates they're right below that also being said look if you want to track your sales and get all that accurate sales data that i talked about go below book a call with us check out hyrule so do a full demo for you it's not gonna be a pushy sales pitch and we'll show you exactly how to track your specific business model we are very familiar with e-commerce webinars sales call funnels and we'll show you exactly how we can make you a lot more money from your ads usually when people come on they're able to increase their ads by at least 20 to 30 percent you're going to see way more results and all the huge clients we've tracked on hiros because that's the baseline result that people get again we also have a 90 day refund guarantee so if you don't see the results i've talked about in this video you don't pay you should go do that if you're going to run google ads because google ad tracking it's not great and then you can also pass highros data back to google ads to make its ai way better at finding new customers just keep on top that if you want
