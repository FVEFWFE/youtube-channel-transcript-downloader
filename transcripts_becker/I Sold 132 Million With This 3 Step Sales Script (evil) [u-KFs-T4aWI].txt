================================================================================

so what I'm going to give you in this video is a call script I've used to sell over $100 million worth of software yes this has generated over $100 million in total sales and it's Point Blank shoot point simple you've probably seen all sorts of other call scripts on the internet and all sorts of other scripts out there use Advanced sales mythology and also of complex processes and take a closer who has a year of experience to do this with what I'm going to show you right here is so incredibly simple that if you understand the framework of this you really don't need a script at all in a call you can just go through this framework and inevitably the person ends up concluding that they need to pay you money this is extremely simple for new closers experienced closers to close with and when I started using this at my software companies which all combined do about over $30 million per year it was shockingly easy to get closes and in fact I could keep ramping up the price ramping up the price ramping up the price because what this does is it Taps into what I like to call an impossible to say no to situation it's like walking up to someone and slapping $100 on a table and saying if you give me $20 I'll give you this $100 they're just going to do it so let me walk you through this framework of what we do now if you're using this to sell you're probably primarily doing this in B2B so this is going to work exceptionally well if you're in B2B but more so I want you to understand the the persuasion process that we're using here so I'm going to walk you through the sales call that we use at hyos now I would run this thing all the time and I didn't even have a script I would just follow this process right here and then it would just simply work so what you need to figure figure out when you're talking to a business is what they believe that they're losing or not gaining by not doing certain things you you want to figure out their beliefs and then use their beliefs I don't want to use the word against them because when you're on a sales call with somebody if you have a good product what you're doing is helping them like the person's going to join your product and they're going to make more money when a person joins hyos and listens to things we say on that sales call they're making 15 to 20% more from their ads cuz it's just simply inevitable if you're using correct data and then feeding it back to AI it just that's how it works it's like the between driving a car blindfolded and drunk and just taking the blindfold off and not doing heroin before you go on your nightly drive it's it's a much better experience so I'm going to use kind of a me versus them kind of analogy when we go through this but I never want you to think as a person on the call you're trying to persuade or trick or get into like some funnel like if the person doesn't get results with your product and you hype anything up past the point of what your product can do they're just going to refund they're going to charge back and your business ultimately won't scale so the first thing you should really do before you can apply these sales processes is get to the point where you can actually get results for businesses on command that's the most important thing first if you can do that everything else will fall into place you could just literally hop in a sales call and put up testimonials and you do pretty well but let's talk about everything we're doing at hrus and then what I want you to do is I want you to look at the process that we're using to convince the person so what we do when the person comes on is we listen to their complaints about their tracking and their setup and their systems with ads okay and and so what we're going to do first and foremost on is we're going to talk about you know do you see where all your sales are coming from on Facebook and Google ads okay so do you see where all your sales are coming from ultimately we know the answer to this is no okay so uh we're going to say all right out of 10 sales that come in how many of them are actually tracked by your Facebook and Google ads they're going to say five six seven something like that okay so we're just going to lay it out right there how much do you think that is stopping you from actually seeing uh gains in your business how how much do you think that's preventing you from running profitable ads and I'll say well you know I I don't really know you know I have these these ads running right here I don't see where all my sales are coming from but I see where a good amount of them are I say well do you think that makes your decision sloppier do you think that makes your your ads run worse and they say yeah yeah I say all right cool so would it be like improper of me to say 15% of your ads you could go 15% further if you saw the rest of these sales coming in and you were able to actually make correct decisions they say yeah yeah that makes that a lot of sense and I say okay how much is your business making they say okay it's making 100,000 a month so we're saying right off the bat right here you're losing about 15,000 a month in scale just because you can't see where the numbers are coming in is this correct is this correct yes okay so then what we do is we repeat the process again with ad waste okay so again you don't see what ads are actually making you money how much do you think this leads to actually guessing wh which ads how many times have you turned on ads or kept your ads running without actually knowing the Real Results they're going to say all the time something like that and say okay all right let's imagine again we fix that problem and you start turning off your losers as well or you start optimizing your ads to the pinpoint would you say that would increase your ad revenue or or cut 10% of waste in the account again yes all right how much is your business spending on ads per month I 50,000 a month okay so can we agree that would be like $5,000 saved yes so what's the total of this amount right here $20,000 so what have I done so far on this business sales call I've gotten the person in their own words to tell me they are losing $20,000 a month in gains and waste by not tracking their ads correctly we haven't even talked about the product we just talk about their pain point and the pains they're experiencing they're losing 20,000 a month okay and they believe it's due to not being able to see this number right here so the first thing we do is we identify the problem that they're having and then we put a number to the problem can you always do this with like self-help or like coaching or goober stuff no that's why that is so hard to sell that's why when I when I build businesses now I make sure I can do this damn thing right here because it leads to the best sales pitch of all time so person comes in right here we just identified that due to not being able to see their numbers just going to draw a thousand arrows in this video by the way they're wasting in this example right here 20% of Revenue you know 15,000 in Lost scale 5,000 in wasted ads so then what I'm going to do is I'm just going to show us fixing this problem right here what we do is we go and this is where it gets imported in B2B we find a business inside of hyros of course with their approval that is in the same Niche and has the same exact problem so if it's an e-commerce store we find an e-commerce store and then we show them how e-commerce stores are losing tons and tons of money now I want to stress one thing right here if if you've ever looked at hris you looked at your own product there's probably a thousand other different things that you do that doesn't matter there has to be one core thing that they're going to get because people are too ADHD this isn't the point where we walk them through every single feature and everything we do we simply want to focus on one thing this number right here which they believe in okay so I'm going to show them a similar business getting the results that they want cutting the waste and I'm going to show them their profit going up them being able to see and identify where all their sales are coming from and then being able to eliminate waste and so then we can actually show them the scale we say all right here's an e-commerce business look at all the sales are tracking look at how their revenue's gone up the last few months here's another e-commerce business here's another e-commerce business do you see this do you see it routinely fixing the problem that you have they say yes they say yes and so what we're then going to say is all right if if you were able to fix this in the same exact way that these business were do you think you'd make that additional 20K per month I mean that's your words you said if we fixed this problem right here and we were able to go and eliminate these two things you'd be making extra $20,000 per month they say yeah I mean good I'm like all right all right let's actually take it down and not let's cut it in half let's just say $10,000 per month all right let's not even be hyperbole right here let's say you get terrible results do you think you could still go and save or gain $10,000 a month more yeah I mean that makes sense we agreed on 20K per month but now let's just cut it in half and let's say you get poo poo results so then at this point in time you can see the exact game we've played here the the value of what I'm offering them is 10K a month $100,000 per year for them that's the number that they've put on this is the number they gave us you can't go and tell them how much something is worth but you can have them tell you how much it's worth to them all day long if the person's saying Z like if if they get on a call and they come in and say oh I'm not tracking any of my sales but I don't think it's losing me any money and I don't think uh I don't think I'm wasting any money by running my ads like a drunk lunatic we have to go back to the start and identify like all right how do you why do you believe that because obviously you're not seeing you're guessing and whatnot and we have to come back and reconfirm this thing but 90% of people that come in are going to already know they're losing and wasting money so at that point in time what do I have to do to get this person to buy what do I have to do to get them in is I have to prove without a shadow of a doubt that what I just said here this 10K the 20K and result they're going to get is true so what I then do is we show them a long page and you're you're going to notice in every sales tactic like for example last few videos ago I showed you the most impactful funnel that you can use for ads ever is a testimonial funnel I'll link to that below this video in the description and at the end of this video you've also seen when I run ads and I use the script Center I use a lot of testimonials and I use the same process just in a shorter framework you can see the exact scripts and in fact the most high converting ad I've ever ran also linked below this video in the description and at the end this video just tell you how it all works but you're again going to see me come back to the same exact tactic we go and take them to a page based on their business model that shows them an unlimited amount of results this obnoxious amount of results of people in their Niche their industry getting results with hyros and getting this money saved in what they're doing then at that point in time we also show them famous people now you're not going to always have testimonies from famous people when you start your business you're not always going to have hundreds of results that's why the first thing you want to do when you start your business is get those testimonials get them from lower level people lower level businesses that you do the work for free for now I talk about how to do this in that other testimony video I'm not going to get into it but there's a complete strewn together way to get testimonies for your business and do this exact same tactic it's not reserved to our business and I was able when I used hyros to go and lure in big famous Brands and large Brands by using the process is again linked below this video and going to be shown at the end of this video so just watch it so I show them endless testimon and I show them famous people testimon that are using hros then what we do is we go through the pitch we break down all right you're going to use hyos um you're going to join you're going to get wonder One assistant we kind of break down what the product does okay and then what we do is we price it at a comical amount lower than what it makes them so for example if the person's doing 100K a month they're probably going to make an extra 15K a month just using hyros okay so we can easily build them $700 a month for that so we say all right cool you want to make that 15K extra a month yeah cool all right how much is that worth to you they say well you know at least like $2,000 $3,000 they're expecting some some huge crazy number we come in right then and say okay it's just 700 bucks a month is that is that worth it to you yes all right well you want to do it for a year and you want to save 30% right so just $5,000 up front now gets you the entire year pow and this point right here I we pointing out to them hey you're trading $55,000 for an extra $100,000 plus dollars a year at this point the person's all in now how do we get the person over the fence if they're thinking all right I don't know if I want to buy right now why not there's all sorts of way ways you can close um and for example there's tons of good closing techniques on like Alex Hero's channels well I'm not saying don't use those what I'm saying is you want to be in this insanely powerful position right here before you even start closing right now we have them in their own words saying this product would make me money if it works we then show them hundreds of times that it works we show them people they respect that it was working for we show them our near-perfect trust pilot reviews so again there's no doubt that this works then the final thing we're going to do right here is we're going on offer them a guarantee that if they don't get these results they don't pay for it you should be able to do this with your prodct if you can do this you're going to get so many people in the door we make this 90-day guarantee at hyos on any payment that if they come in they don't see these results we'll just refund them and this gets everybody across the fence because again it's like what do you think is going to go wrong here you just told me how much money this is going to make you we just proved that this is going to make you that money and then we're taking away every single risk why won't you join now this is where more traditional Clos in processes are going to come from you want to figure out what the person uh why they might not want to join and then counter those objections or find ways to push them off so for example a person might think well I don't know if I'm going be able to set this up or if it's going to apply for my business oh that's a really good question here's 10 other businesses just like yours that set this up and by the way we'll just have someone do it for you one final tip I'll give you when you're closing on these things is design your product around the close if you know people are going to have resistance when they're saying oh you know I I I don't know if I'll be able to set this up or get it applied or I'm going to be able to read the data already have that worked into your product for when they say that and so when you do these calls you're always always always going to see specific things pop up design your offer around that as you evolve your product and your company so this right here isn't so much like a fivepoint step by step exactly what to say pitch it what it is is a framework of how to convince people to do literally anything when it comes to B2B or service-based business calls which is what you're primarily going to be selling I don't think you're going to be selling protein powder over the phone okay I think you could probably use this logical process to consumer marketing but I've never done that before and so the point I want to get to you in this video is you don't want to use you can use scripts and exact things to say but it's way better to have a framework of where you're trying to get the customer to and just in a chill relaxed way going through that framework what's the first thing I got to do at hus we have to identify that they have a problem okay then we have to quantify the problem they have to quantify the problem for themselves I can't say oh this is losing you $110,000 per month I have to say how much is this losing you per month you're you're doing 100,000 a month um you're spending 50,000 a month in your ads you know how much is this causing you to lose well I don't know I'm like all right well let's just like think about it let's like break it down we're just going to sit there and we're going to do that until they come up with a number on their own if the person thinks they're losing Z and they have no use for this they wouldn't be on the call okay and they're definitely not going to close if they think they don't have a problem whatsoever so you got to dig that up first quantify it sell them it for less than they think they've Quantified or if they think they're losing 10,000 a month sell it to them for 1,000 bucks a month then prove it undeniably then remove all risk then deal with basic objections and whatnot this is a very simple pattern you can follow that anyone can follow and you can do it in a very chill Way new reps can do it old reps can do it and if you have really Elite sales skills it's just going to complement this pattern that we just went through but you're not going to get anything done with some Elite sales script until you've done all those steps that I just did if a person doesn't believe they have a problem and more specifically they haven't Quantified that problem they're not going to want to pay you for a solution if you make that solution less than the Quantified number that theyve described they're going to see it as a Roi if you prove it then works with tons and tons of testimonials they have no doubts and if you remove all risk they have no reason not to try this is the perfect this is the perfect situation to get someone to give you money and this is the perfect situation to apply any other sales skills you have so that being said if you want to see how I get tons of testimonials and results for people in our businesses there's a link right here on the video right now also in the description you want to see the exact ad script I use to get people to these funnels right here you want to see the funnels themselves and what I sell also right here it's all laid right here no pitches nothing being sold to you on this channel enjoy that's all there is to it I don't have anything else to tell you so uh I'll see you next video
