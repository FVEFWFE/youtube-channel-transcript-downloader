================================================================================

everyone and I mean everyone who makes a lot of money from their business I'm talking a n figure1 million plus businesses which I can tell you about cuz I built them does this why do they do this because it makes ads [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] money and you don't even have to be good at it you can actually be quite bad as soon as I made this shift in my business I went for having a business did a couple seven figures a year to having combined amount of businesses that do $30 $40 million per year businesses that have $100 million valuations businesses that have busted $100,000 a day in ads I'm rich I don't see that the brag okay I kind of do I just want to let you know this is what [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] works and I have no course or anything to sell you because I've already made enough money doing this I just want to add you to my retargeting list so I can Target you for my software company that's really what I'm doing here but you're going to learn a lot in the process now this tag teams on the last video that I showed you guys where I showed you the process of using High ticket sales to essentially get customers from ads for free if you didn't watch that video there's a link to it at the end of this video there's also a link in the description you should watch that video as soon as you're done with this because that's the key to getting everything into what I'm about to show you for free that's how you get tons of customers in your business ready to be [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slapped with value okay don't don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] slap your customers I'm sorry I just have to sit up here and use profanity and entertain myself with horrible metaphors because I've been making business content for way too long if I don't scream poop jokes and say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] a few times this is just dreadfully boring for me so please let me Spruce it up so I don't commit sioku from talking about business for the Thousand time but if you do this your ads are simply going to work they are going to print money it's almost impossible not to do this and you can finally stop making social media and YouTube videos that get customers you can actually Chuck up walk up to the table and buy customers like a man it feels great not to have to go on Tik Tok every day and shake your butt around make faces and dance around like some skibbidy Rizzy genzer you know you you're probably like 20 30 years old it's time to stop it it's time to actually learn how to run traffic like a grown adult this is how you do it so look last video I showed you how to get high ticket sales and essentially send people in to your business at no cost for example in that video let's say we bought 500 leads for $5 a lead I showed you how to essentially break even on that or even make money just by selling a high ticket this allows us to get 500 customers in for free that's the Golden Goose right there now what we need to do once we get the customers in the business for free is we gain a few things when we get a customer into the business specifically if you gather their email using that opin page again I'll link to that video at the end of this video as well it all Ties on that so you have to know what I'm talking about a little bit just watch those videos but what we did before we did the high ticket Clos is we sent people to an optin this gets us a few things this gets us their email when they go to the high ticket content video that happens after this get gets us rapport with them and they're also on a retargeting list so what do we have here we have the contact information and an easy way to contact them cheaply via ads and they like us if we made a good content video after they opted in this is a person just Prime to be sold to for years if you handle it correctly so let's imagine we get these 500 people on the email list now I can give you a follow-up strategy exactly what to say on the email list and be a retargeting ads we'll get to that later on the channel you just need to start looking at it this way imagine if if we get these 500 people to on average spend $5 a month with us over a year and this is totally possible to do with email list by the way $5 per lead isn't that hard especially if you're in the right Niche hell let's just say $2 let's keep it simple let's be idiots about this let's let's imagine you're underperformer you're just a 6 IQ Point dude trying to make your way in the world so that's $1,000 in sales times 12 off of $2,500 in ad spend while being terrible at this this is where people mess up everything I laid out here you're thinking this this Zone's too simple just mark it to them after yes you cover your cost with a high ticket product if you're a person it must cover your cost I don't even focus on that CU I don't care obviously you can see you make so much more money down here why even focus on this part but most of you who are starting a business and don't want to lose money up front and need to make money right away this is the best strategy to use so watch that video at the end of this video but what we then do is we hit them up on our email list list with procs affiliate offers if you're an absolute degenerate just build your own business you don't need to run affiliate offers but if you must other high ticket offers while also sending these people via emailing and retargeting more content that is good to keep that Rapport going and as long as you keep the Rapport going you can easily remarket them cheaply so for example if you have 5,000 people you can retarget them on Facebook for like three bucks a day effectively at huge profitability you can email them for free you keep that Rapport going it's not too hard to get 10 people out of this 500 to spend a 100 bucks with you each month thus getting to that goal of $2 per lead because they already trust you they already like you they're on the list because they're interested in what you're talking about so you just do that now there's all sorts of advanced things you can do with e-commerce businesses or software but what 90% of people don't do is this get the lead pay for the lead upfront using the high ticket tactic then measure how much the lead spends with you on average over year getting the $1 to $2 is easy then you're going to see that every $5 lead you get spends $24 with you so you're just trading $5 bills for $24 on autopilot I do this in a much more complicated way with SAS businesses where I'll pay like $2,000 for $400 a subscription and you're probably like how's he do that it's because I track how the subscription stay they say on average for two years so I make $8,000 from $2,000 you combine that over a lot of AD spend you print money this is the shift you need to make if you want to see how to get the leads into your business essentially for free watch this video if you want to see the actual funnel the landing pages being used to accomplish this to give you some ideas watch this video if you want to not die alone and you want your children to think you're a very impressive man you can run ads in a business very functionally subscribe to this channel I don't have anything else to say to you
