================================================================================

if you're a Shopify store owner I have three simple questions for you and the bad news is if any of the answers to these questions are no you are probably making 3050 percent or even a hundred percent less than your store should be making keyword should this isn't like going out there doing something spectacular increase sales this is like literally having a bucket with a bunch of holes in it and expecting it to hold water if your answer is no to these questions you have a big old bucket with a bunch of holes in it and you are literally letting all the water drip out of it you were letting all the sales that you should be getting drip out when you shouldn't be so let me ask you these very simple questions and make it painfully obvious why if you do not fix these things you are literally factually choosing to make thirty fifty percent or even up to a hundred percent less then you should be from your stores let me ask you these so question number one how much money are you making after the sale this is by far the most important question in your business and if you understand the long-term value of your customers and the leads that come into your business you can 2x or 3x your business literally just by applying this let me explain so look at this shirt right here that we're selling from our store it cost 10 dollars and 20 cents in order for me to make any reasonable amount of profit I need to get a sale on ads from this only spending about $5 that completely destroys my ability to scale because I have to be very careful with my ad spend I have to go get this sale at five bucks but don't you think it'd be easier for me to scale my ads if I could spend ten dollars per sale twenty dollars per sale I'd completely run my competition in the ground and the truth is I can I can actually double my money while spending $20 to get this $10 sale because I have stats that show me exactly how much my customers are worth in the long term check this out so if I pull in the stats that I gathered by plugging in my Shopify store into market hero I am able to go and calculate the long-term value of each customer over three months now check out the data that market hero gives me on average in the first week here's the first sale you can see me making 10 dollars and 20 cents but on week two on average people come back and spend another fifteen dollars by week four on average people have spent twenty dollars with me by week six after entering my business and getting emails from market hero they on average spend $32 with me and then finally after that forty three dollars how much is a person that buys this t shirt via add really worth for me it's not ten dollars and 20 cents and that's what most ecommerce people do they send a person straight to their store and their profit comes strictly from the first sale and then thats it they'll make a second sale but it's all about that first sale I don't care about the first sale at all because I know because of the data that is inside of market hero from my email marketing to people that have bought from the store they're gonna come back and spend 30 more dollars with me on average what does this mean I can spend literally 20 dollars per sale and like clockwork make an extra $20 and double my money and I can go in outbid any of my competitors for my ad and scale my business to the moon this is actually how I built my first three multi-million dollar companies using this exact LTV tactic and here's the cool part if you come inside of market hero right now you can literally have your store connected in minutes your customers are automatically imported your data is completely analyzed and you were literally seconds away from seeing the long-term value your customers getting data that can completely change your entire business and help you make much better profitable decisions from your marketing and heck even analyze how your email marketing is affecting and growing your business around your ad and again if you just click that free trial link in this ad you can set this up plug in your store for free right now and get this data without paying a dime number two are you upselling and down selling your customers based on the behavior now I'm not just talking about an abandoned cart email market hero does that day one that's easy thing that should be something that's automatic if your system doesn't currently do that holy moly what are you doing I'm talking about going and strategically marketing people based on their behavior with your emails so for example if a person comes to my store right now and buys this t-shirt I want to get them to buy a hoodie I want to get them to buy a cap I want to get them to come in buy a phone case and I need to be able to market to them based on what they bought and haven't bought so what I can do it here is I can come into market hero and my tags are already set when a person buys this whenever someone buys this they automatically get this tag applied to them and a value to their customer value inside of market hero so I'm able to see exactly how much this person is worth to me for example I can go into my leads here and go okay cool this person has bought this product for me and is worth this much money to me and that's that where we get all the data and averages that you saw on that LTV calculation by the way this is all automatically done for you you're gonna be able to see exactly how much your customers are worth to you and then calculate all sorts of data based around how much that value is worth and that's automatically done for you but back to the topic at hand when someone comes in they're gonna get tagged with this tag telling me they completed this purchase all right so here's where it starts to get really nasty so after someone buys this gauntlet t-shirt from our store what's gonna happen is instead gonna trigger a funnel inside of market hero whenever that tag is applied so the second this tag is applied gauntlet which is what I have to fire whenever someone buys that shirt I want to try and get them to come in and buy one of these shirts okay it has a different design on it they just bought a t-shirt from us maybe they'll buy another one with a different design on so what I'm gonna have happen is I'm gonna have it wait maybe a day okay because I don't to start spamming the person's email right away and what's gonna do is it's gonna send them an email offering them a really special deal on this shirt right here to incentivize them purchasing it so I'm gonna go in here I'm just gonna write out a new email now you'll probably fill this out with whatever you want we can create just about any type of email you want for example I recreated the entire Maverick email again this is just a recreation we're not sending this out or anything like that or representing the Maverick Brent at all we're sure that we can create even the best selling brands emails and recreate them using market hero for now I'm just gonna put in filler content because I'm sure you can imagine what you'd be sending to somebody so once that happens we're gonna send them an email trying to get them to buy this shirt now two things are gonna happen they're gonna buy well they're not gonna buy so we're gonna have it wait two days because that's about the time it'll take for them to either make the decision to buy the shirt or seed the email and then what's gonna happen is after those two days we're gonna go and sort them by whether they bought or not so if the person did buy the tag really what we want to do is we want to go and get them to buy a hoodie like if they just bought this and they just bought that they must really love our products it's gonna buy something else this is the number one way to increase tell TV the number one way to increase the amount of sales that we're getting per customer the amount of money we're making per customer so what we want to have happen is if they do buy and they have a purchase tag that fires when they purchase this shirt which would be defect what's gonna happen is we'll sort them by their tag and we'll have the market hero system recognize when they have the tag defect and say okay cool this person bought this shirt let's go up here and send them to this get them to buy another shirt so what's gonna happen right here we're gonna go and send them another email so just boom filler content easy enough right there okay so just imagine email worth something that and so then what's gonna happen it's gonna sell them this next shirt right here now if they don't buy though well one we just send them back maybe they missed the email maybe they didn't buy let's just give them another chance well give them even better discount on that one shirt and send them right back to buy this notice can go on and on on let's imagine after this we're gonna go and have it way too in sort by tagging let's imagine they buying that second email then boom what we're gonna have happen one more time and I'm not gonna go into philosophic because I think you get the gist of it is if they do buy that boom we just set him straight to southern when we can create a never-ending funnel that sorts them and shows them based on what they're buying and just doing this alone is an easy way to increase your sales by 30 50 100 percent why because the person that comes through and just bought something is probably pretty likely to buy something else and if they buy something again they're super likely to buy something else keep doubling down and keep increasing the value per customer and then again what market hero is going to allow you to do is come over here to your finance section and you're gonna be able to go and say wow that funnel I just put in has increased the value I'm making per customer by twenty fifty one hundred percent and again you are literally seconds from having this data and having the ability to add this up sell down sell all this crazy functionality to your store just do that free trial below and on top of that free trial we're gonna throw in a full email marketing course for Shopify this is a full fledged course that's gonna show you that we've actually charged 997 four in the past that will teach you everything you need to know about email marketing especially email marketing for Shopify exactly how to go do these upsells these down sells how to get your customers converting what to put in your emails how to write your emails how to actually get free traffic for other places how to actually run email marketing for your Shopify store from paid traffic how to actually sell your products for your webinars just like I am doing at Specter right now which is my supplement company that actually did closes six figures in its first week of opening because I sell via webinars and then follow up with email marketing which is absolutely lethal now just that also being said market here does everything else your system does it sends emails it allows you to send broadcasts out to your customers go and track the data and see exactly how your customers are opening these email create individual procs and their prices go and sort all your leads integrates with that every single big platform you to operate within your Shopify store and allows you to go out there and just make beautiful emails based on what your customers have bought and their actions you can sort and segment your store just like you can inside your Shopify store and so if a person's about one product but not another product guess what you can do you can go and just send them specific prod Emile's based on that and then send out these emails to them easy peasy lemon squeezy I've just been wanting to get that that bling go into the sad so far but let's get to the final question and this one's very simple talking to your customers doesn't just come down to email marketing what about facebook messenger are you sending facebook messenger messages to people when they abandon your cart if not you're missing a huge amount of money more importantly that you know you can automate your facebook Messenger messages that interact it's just like thats funnel I just showed you let me show you so when a person comes right here and hits Add to Cart they're gonna come in and what's gonna happen is if they abandon this cart when the car is abandoned bill and market hero sends a message to your customer saying hey did you leave this behind you might want to come back and check this out and because Facebook minister has crazy high open rates this is a way better way to get your customers coming back to your store this is a way better way to increase your sales by 30% just by capturing the people that were already attending to check out in the first place but then like before we want to go and then automate this just like we did our email so what I'm gonna do is are my you look like new Facebook stream and I'm gonna have happen I'm Simon guard here to Aleksandr Becker and whenever a person comes in and starts these processes we're gonna sort by tag and we can send the same type of facebook messenger automation that we talked about you can then message your customers links to videos or product demos which aren't necessarily salesy that Facebook will lie to send and guess what this can go out there and double your business because I guarantee you right now you probably have a bunch of people that would be in your facebook Messenger account and it's a real shame because if you just had this automation set up automatically you would be collecting a person's facebook Messenger every single time they come and start checkout on your store and then I could go out there and easily and start sending messages these people and sending them access to your live streams your webinars whatever you're doing and immediately start monetizing that second list of people that you're just not even gathering that is just huge money left on the table they could go out there increase your store by 30 to 50 percent and those are my questions for you are you doing these three things probably not cuz market here is literally the only system on earth that does all three of these things and it's really the only system on earth that does any of those things when it comes to Shopify marketing and so that ladies you have one bigger question why not go below and try this system for free why not go below and connect your Shopify store in literal seconds it takes a few buttons to

you your exact sales data all the metrics behind your store you need to run your store better run your clients stores better it is absolutely insane if you were using any other system and when you read the top of the sad I mean it if you are not using market hero right now you are literally lighting money on fire you are literally choosing to make less money from your shop buy stores because simply going out there and knowing your LTV doing the upsell and down sell automations that we covered and adding facebook Messenger to your store not only something that only market hero can do for Shopify stores but is also a way to almost instantly increase your stores revenue by thirty fifty even a hundred percent if you're just gonna play these things how is your store going to change if you can suddenly start running your marketing much more accurately and increasing the revenue you're making per customer what if your customers came back and spent two times three times what they're spending now at your store what if your customers went through funnels where they're automatically up sold and down sold stuff that they're already interested in thus making them spend more what if your customers simply start getting facebook Messenger notifications letting them know they abandon the cart and sending them to news updates from your site that will go in and again give you an entire new list of people and a new way to reach your customers to get them come back to your store what would that do for your business tons so I'm begging you right now go below simply go up and
