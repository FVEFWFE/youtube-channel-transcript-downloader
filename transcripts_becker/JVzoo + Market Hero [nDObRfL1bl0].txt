[Music] what is up jvzoo members this south becker CEO of market hero instead of giving you some long drawn-out sales pitch and why you should use market hero I'm simply going to show you how you increase the amount of sales you make on your next launch by 30 to 40 percent simply by integrating with us I'm about to show you features and processes and behavioral based triggers that no other autoresponder is going to offer you and you're able to do it just with a few clicks inside of jvzoo trust me what I'm about to show you you've never been able to do before and it's going to increase the amount you make from your next launch your next product sale heck it's going to show you exactly how to go and grow your business because you're actually gonna be able to calculate exactly how much every single lead that comes in from jvzoo is making you in the long term it's going to change your business forever let me show you how so when the product edit tab right now and if I were to integrative mark here let me show you how simple it is to do everything after that so what we have set right here as I've said it so that when anybody buys anything from jvzoo this product what's going to happen is is going to assign the tag product day and in dollar sign bot a so it's going to tell us that someone bought this product and it's also going to start another action in our system that allows us to do a lot of deep automations like up celtic person if they don't buy upsell and then upsell them again if they don't buy the next upsell maybe down send them with a free product let me show you a simple that is to do you can see what I've done right here inside of market hero is I've gone and created what I like to call this start action by the way this whole builder right here you can build anything like this it's drag-and-drop it's easy to use so you can see right here I have what I call the start action now what happens when a tag product day is applied remember the tag we had applied when anybody buys our product inside of jvzoo what's going to happen is it's going to wait 30 minutes I have right here if a conversion pixel is hit so what's going to happen right here is going to wait 30 minutes and by the way placing a conversion pixel is easy you have Thank You page all you need to do is go to the products area right here copy a pixel place that pixel on the page you're done okay this signs a dollar value to every single person that views that page you're actually gonna be able to weigh that against each other so you can see exactly how much every single person from your last launch is making you over the span of three months six months year but anyways when that conversion pixels not hit in this example let's say they bought our first product and didn't buy the OTO by the way that's a huge amount of your sales what's going to happen is it's going to go wait 30 minutes and then send an email saying hey why didn't you buy this would you like another offer would you like a free trial would you like something else we're able to fall based on what the person does and we can go really crazy like I'm going to show you here in a second so let me show you another automation is cry created here just in a few seconds you can see right here what's going to happen again let's imagine the person goes through and they buy our first upsell okay but they haven't bought OTO number two what's going to happen again is I'm going to go here I made the tag OTO - okay now it's going to be set simply by placing it inside jvzoo like I just showed you now what's going to happen when they buy the first upsell again a pixel will wait to see if they bought or not okay when the guy haven't bought in 30 minutes they've had enough time to go and look at the upsell everything it's going to flow up again say hey why don't you pick this up then same exact conversion pixel you can follow up again and say hey why didn't you pick this up now at this point in time they haven't bought the final upsell that's kind of annoying maybe they need to trust a little bit more maybe they need some more information so what's going to happen right here is we're going to put a tag on them called nurture okay so we again put a start action right here again we can drag and drop it's that easy to put these all together just like drawing a cool picture there's a lot of nice colors I think and what's going to happen right here is a tag nurse is going to be applied and so we're going to set them down a funnel right here that sends them some valuable information some training whatnot so they like us a bit more over the next two days okay now what's going to happen at the end of this this is going to funny is when they go and finish this valuable information right here and we can set these tags and actions right here be based on anything we could have it based on whether they click an email if they open an email we can remove tags we can apply tags anything you would ever want to do a mission wise you can do in this system now what's really cool is when they go and finally complete this value it's going to sign as hag to them OTO two and boom it's going to send where I'd done this funnel again and start getting them pick up a OTO that they didn't pick up in the first place dramatically increasing your sales because you're marking the people based on what they've done and based on what they haven't bought now here's the real kicker and what I think is the coolest part of market hero here's another funnel like the one I just created but you can see it's a little bit more long it's a little bit more now what's going to happen when people go through this phone on what's already has happened is you can see right here at the top it actually calculates how much people were buying and it shows me exactly how much they're worth per lead so right here when a person opps in it tells me oh wow this person has gone through this and on average every single person goes through this funnel is making me an extra four dollars and 84 cents so we're able to see when somebody joins from jvzoo we can go and track everything they've done and go wow this recapture funnel I'm actually making another five bucks on top of what I'm already doing right there that's huge that shows me how much money is leaking out of my marketing right now now here's what's even cooler we all know that when someone buys from me the first time i jb z that's just a start and the person is now on your customer base and can be promoted to you can build rapport them they can buy a lot from me in the future in fact that's where most money and launches are made I've had six hundred thousand million dollar launches in the past and I'll tell you I always made almost twice three times the money in the back end through talking to my customers and getting to know them and gave them to buy other stuff for me so what is really core ID here let's imagine we do a super small launch in jvzoo 31 people okay so I can grow it here and not only can I sort people by what they've bought and what they've done and where they've gone for example here's everybody on my business source wave I can go and look at another business right here instantly there's no complicated list or anything like that crap that's another autoresponders but you can see right here what I have going on is that Gord here and I go okay everybody that came into this funnel everyone who bought this product how much do they worth to me over six months what else are they buying if I go an average all these people against each other on average how much of these people worth to me so I go right here and click generate LTV and it's going to tell me holy-moly these people are worth 30 bucks to me over two weeks over a month over six months I mean I say Wow for every single person that came through that last jvzoo launch I actually made an additional $30 from them over the next five months because I can go and see everything they bought for me and by the way going and tracking what they bought from your affiliate promotions is easy you just simply go and create another procs in our product tab it's going to give you this link right here and all you have to do is go ask your JV manager to paste this on the Thank You page trust me people that want you promoting their launches they want you to be able to see your numbers so you want to promote more they're going to do this okay and going and doing this for your own launch go to your Thank You page copy and paste this in anywhere on the page I prefer the header you're done you're done that's it and that's how easy it is to integrate with us from jvzoo go and start automation so increase the sales from launch follow up convinced and react based on what people are doing and the behaviors they're doing not just blind marketing them that's not it's not going to work you can't do that and then what you're able to do is calculate how much they're worth overall long time and so maybe you're gonna see well you know I'm making an extra 60 bucks from every single person that bought from my launch over six months maybe next launch I'll launch it 100 percent commission so that I can go and get these leads in because I know I'm already making a ton of money in the backend from it that's a business changing stat that's a business changing metric you cannot get that metric in any other system if you want to go out there integrate with any other system good luck creating these type of automations good luck going out there and calculating how much those automations are making you good luck calculating exactly how much every single person that comes in from your last launch is making you in the first week two weeks three weeks two months six months you're going to see the webinars as you promote after that offers you permanent after and all the other creative marketing you can do just besides what I just showed

you before all that's standing between you and going increase in the amount you make on every single launch is going in copying paste in your API in going down here putting these simple tags and building out these simple funnels in fact when you hop inside I'm going to leave a few jvzoo specific funnels that are relevant to selling your upsells down selling your upsells getting more from your
