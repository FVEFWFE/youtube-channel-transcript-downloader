okay guys what I want to show you in this video is really the true power when you combine Market hero with Shopify and it allows you to do stuff you just can't do anywhere else this video is going to shock you almost with what you're able to do and how it's going to change your marketing with Market hero not only are you able to run abandoned curent sequences not only are you able to upsell your customers and sell them stuff that they're interested in purchasing in what you're also able to do is track everything they do in every purchase they make so you're able to calculate the long-term value for every customer that comes to your store let's imagine a person comes to your store and buy a $10 product right now you don't have the data to tell you how much that person is worth to you in 2 months 3 months 6 months how much they're buying from you how much they open your emails now with Market hero when you go inside of Shopify with it what you're able to do is calculate everything they buy after that so what you're going to be able to do is see wow you know usually people that buy this $10 product also buy this product and they're worth about $75 to me in the long run after a year once you en know that information it changes your marketing forever cuz your value per customer goes from10 bucks to $75 that changes up your ad game just a little bit let me show you how you're able to track this and know exactly what your customers are doing know exactly how much they're worth to you so you can completely change your marketing by doing this so we're inside the Shopify app right now I put in the market Hero app and I have a few things that happen right here when a person comes in they have a tag applied to them and more importantly what happens whenever they buy a product we have a specific tag and a specific sequence or value applied to them or purchase tag that shows us they buy B this product so let's imagine a person comes to our store right now we're going to go I'm going to open up an incognito window and we're from the customer's point of view right now so we're going to go and buy this t-shirt inside of our store so going through going to add this sucker to the cart and I'm going to go through the basic checkout process now what you're going to see right now I'm just going to put in um Beckers hotmail.com I I don't know whose email that is but thank you for the compliment I'm just going to fill out the shipping information FY not a address and when we go on right here and I hit continue the shipping method just going to go through the standard checkout process I want to show you what's happened already inside Market hero so if we go back over to Market hero and I'm going to jump over here to our leads and open this in a new window when we go into Market hero right here what's going to show is that this person has started the checkout process so and you can see right here the app or the tag has already been applied to it the app has gone in and applied the tag and so it's happened right here is it shows us it started the T-shirt process so here's where things start to get really cool so we go back over to our stream or funnel what happens whenever the tag start shirt is applied that's applied automatically when they're going through the checkup process this funnel is going to start and so what it's going to do is it's going to wait five minutes and it's going to sort people by their tag that they have applied to them so if they have the tag bot shirt they bought the shirt it's going to sort them and send them down to an upsell if they have not bought the shirt after 5 minutes it means they abandoned the cart so we can start an abandon cart sequence just like that that's going to increase your sales by like 30% right there just cuz you're able to follow up with people that aband the cart and sell sell more to people that have already bought you can sell them something they're already interested in as well but it gets even better than that cuz we want to get in a long-term tracking so let's go back to the store let's go back from the customer's point of view we're going to go here and we're going to continue to the payment method and we're going to just check out like normal so we're going to complete the order gets processed and what you're going to see happen inside of Market hero right now when we go and look at that lead so when we go back over to our lead section you're going to see the value of this customer is now $25 he bought a shirt so we can see that he bought a shirt we can see everything that he bought under his purchases but look you know people can buy multiple shirts they can go buy multiple products so we want to calculate how much this person Buys in the future as well so let's imagine this person comes back a week later and by the way what we have going on this stream right here the same stream will start again the same followup sequence we'll start again because we're going to remove the tag start shirt so the next thing they start the sequence again they'll get start and sent right down this funnel all over again let's imagine we're at customer again okay we go back to the T-shirt site okay so we're back in the T-shirt site you know what we really like that t-shirt I mean this this t-shirt we want to give it to our kids we want to give it to our dog we want to give it to everybody so we're going to go through and we're going to buy another t-shirt now I'm going to skip this right here actually we can just watch it and what we're going to do is we're just going to fil everything all the same again so what just happened is I'm going through the checkup process again filling this out and so here's the really cool part okay we're going to be able to track exactly how much this person is worth to us in the long term so I'm going to complete this order again okay so the order has been completed again we're going to go back over to this lead and inside of Market hero and you can see the value of the lead has been increased to $50 okay we can see everything they've purchased pretty cool right that means we can go out there and we can calculate the value of every single customer comes to our store so the true power of that let's imagine we have thousands of customers coming through our store and we want to calculate exactly how much every single person that comes in is worth to us in the long term so I can go right here let's just use an example right here from a store that I run online U my own business actually if I go right here and I go to generate LTV it tells me exactly how much every single person it com comes in so what I'm going to be able to do here in a little bit when I go through my business right here is I'm going to be able to go and see exactly how much every single person that starts the checkout process is worth to me I can see everything they buy from Me Maybe you promote affiliate products down the road maybe you promote other stores you can go in and every every single sale that's in there is going to be calculating so you can see so day you can say wow dude for every $20 purchase that I've sold I'm actually making $120 off that customer CU they come back and buy two or three more things on average that changes your business forever and that's why you need to hop on the free TR that I've linked to in this post because there's nothing else that can do this okay there's nothing else that's going to give you your long-term value and calculate the amount you're making and average it all out so you can really grow your store strategically once you have this number once you have your LTV for example if I go right here and look at this one tag and say how many of how many of these people are there and how much are they worth to me I can see it's $25 each you know why I grow my business I buy leads for $ to $6 and I just grow it to the freaking Moon same exact thing with your Shopify store but there's nothing else that does this so so hop on the free trial above just the the card abandonment and the upsell ability right there is going to increase your sales by 20 to 30% alone and then being able to go out there and do this this will allow you to 3x 4X 5x your business like I have with my businesses in the past two years so that's all there is to it uh I this blows my mind it's so freaking cool we finished this up the other day I just wanted to share it with you all right this has been Becker
