================================================================================

i guarantee the four hacks i show in this video are going to make you significantly more money from your ads without you changing anything that's a big bold statement actually one of these will actually get you paid to run ads i actually funded an entire year of amazon purchases just using this tactic on top of that one of these tactics is going to just make your ads be more efficient without you doing anything it's not even ai it's just going in and setting a little rule that'll make it so your ads don't spend money in a goofy way everything i'm going to show you in this video every little tiny hack is not going to require you to do anything different on your ad account and if you spend let's say a hundred thousand dollars per year this is easily going to save you about 10 to 15 000 a year and then probably make you like an extra three to five thousand dollars a year just running ads and you don't have to change anything so just pay attention unless you like spending extra money meaninglessly and if you'd like doing that you you here's my crypto wallet you should send bitcoin there not gonna do that okay well then i guess you're the person like saving money so let me show you this okay guys so usually in these videos what i do is give you some ad hacks you can use to buy ads and be more efficient it's usually all about just you know making more money from your ads what i'm going to show you in this video though will make you a lot more money from your ads regardless of anything you're doing in your ads like i talked about i'm going to show you four hacks that will if let's say you spend 15 000 a month on ads this year this is going to save you 50 grand i'm not even kidding and it's going to make you money when you buy ads so let's just get into it the first thing i'm going to tell you first and foremost that you really really should just do and this is such a basic thing that i didn't do for the longest time is go and get yourself an american express business gold card i actually use stripe cards for my ad accounts because they have really good rewards as well but i'm not kidding you whenever i was using my first ad accounts i'd usually use a debit card or a wire directly from a bank account and usually when you're using credit cards they get locked up all the time and so will knock your ad spent off it will knock you out of learning american express cards just i don't have any i don't have any relation in american express by the way they just literally never shut down they'll spend your money no matter what which is a good and a bad thing but i can't stress there's been months where i'm spending ten twenty five thousand dollars a day and you're making a good i don't have the exact numbers right here because i don't pay attention to tiny details you're making an extra ten thousand fifteen thousand a month just an extra credit card bonus points that you can then use to fly your staff around you can actually just use it to buy things on amazon so i was like ah cool so i have like ten thousand bucks to spend on amazon every single month for the business and whatnot so that's something you should just do right away now the second thing i'm going to show you is a really interesting hack you can use for adwords so what a lot of people do when they're going and buying ads is when they go and make changes in their account and this is just like a tiny account that they have they're going to go like this and make the changes like this and maybe like if if you're kind of smart what you're going to do is you're going to come in at three i get up at like 3 4 a.m so i just but normal people time 7 a.m and change your budgets because if you're changing your budgets in the middle of the day you're causing all sorts of havoc in your account but this is even the wrong way to do it because the way that most ad buying softwares work and this is unproven this is complete alex becker hearsay but the way they work is they look at your spend that you have set at the beginning of the day and then they kind of budget throughout the rest of the day okay so if you set your budget at the whenever the ad manager reloads to like 200 and this isn't exactly how it works i'm sure but this is just what i see and so this is my theory behind it what's gonna happen is it's gonna equally spread that out throughout the day whereas if you have your budget set to 20 and you increase it to 200 right here google not so much facebook is going to go haywire and try and spend this in the last few hours and just rip up your ad spend so how do you stop this okay we want to get our budget changes in right here so the easiest way to do this is actually just go to your campaigns you see the budgets right here and we're going to go and create an automated rule and what i'm going to do is i'm just going to have a rule fire we're going to go change budgets and we're going to increase the average daily budget and set a new budget and let's just say let's increase the budget by 15 20 now you can do this for only a few campaigns the ones you selected or just the entire camp account i usually do this for the campaigns that i see working well and i'm not going to go change the this right here gives me a nice clean budget change so it goes live literally the first minute of the day and i don't have to wake up early to change the budgets because again if you're changing budgets in the middle of the day everything i just said here is hearsay this is going to cause havoc you're going to see weird things happen in your account you'll see your cpl or targeting go haywire and you'll be like what happened and it's this now another thing that's going to help you scale a lot better that really has nothing to do with how you run your ads it's just a nice simple thing only increase your budgets by about 15 to 25 a day on these platforms again alex becker hearsay right here but whenever i go and increase it by a lot the algorithms seem to just go a little bit wonky or they just try to rush out the budget i really never increase more than 25 a day on facebook and that can be a really large increase if you're at a thousand bucks a day that's 250 bucks and you got an exponential increase right there so you go from you know 10 000 to 12.50 a day and scale really easily doing that so that's just a general tip that i also use as well next one that i constantly see on facebook is you need to go look at your campaigns and you need to make sure that you are 100 not doing this so if you go look at some of the campaigns i'm going to try and find a really good one where i've actually done this and it's stupid uh we go look at this campaign right here and you can look at the text on this ad okay it's a very funny ad if you haven't seen our comic book ads they're awesome it's a picture of a little raven and our big raven and there's all these little funky media buying birds throwing money down the toilet because they're not using hyrus to track their ads which surprise surprise i'm also probably going to tell you in this video if you don't want to waste money and you don't want to give just give your money to ad companies you should track correctly so you can turn off bad ads and scale good ads as effectively as possible across most accounts that i see over the span of year people are at least wasting 15 of their ad spend and killing at least 15 percent of their scale if you're spending a hundred thousand dollars a year it's and you're making 2x roi that's an extra i'm just going through it you're just you're throwing away like an extra 30 in profit just by not tracking ads correctly but i talk about it every video so i'm not going to talk about right here what i'm most going to tell you is check this out you can see how it looks right here but if i go look at the variation in the sidebar okay look at how this ad looks right right here all right so this is an ad that facebook is going to run for me and this makes no sense look at this headline it's very tiny and you can't even see the image and if i go and actually look at the sidebar ad which is going to be like right here this makes no sense okay you can see the headline right here actually makes a lot of sense because i've optimized the headlines for the sidebar but you can see this image right here isn't doing me any favors if you want to instantly make more money from your ads and save a lot of money don't do this this is this is the easiest way because facebook's not gonna get good conversions from the sidebar right here so it's not gonna like run this competitively with your order ads but it's gonna throw like five to ten percent a day ish on these sidebar ads that's an extra over the span of a year 100 000 an ad spend that's an extra 10k spent on ads that like literally aren't gonna work so you could go and use that to buy like a thousand chipotle burritos maybe okay those things are expensive these days but you can see this is just goofy don't do this check your image ads and what you should make sure of what i suggest you do is you want image ads where your face or something very clearly stands out so what i do on my image ads is i just put my face because people can recognize that thing from all my other ads and so they know what's going on there okay this right here unless you have the world's greatest vision is that a great image for an ad so here's another thing that people do that drives me up a wall and you can do this on facebook you can do this on adwords when you are scaling what people like to do is they like to act like their ads work like a toilet whereas if you start the flushing action that thing is getting flushed it's going to go all the way down and you cannot stop the flushing okay you've spent that water when you're scaling up campaigns especially when you make big new scales or when you are adjusting ads or heck when they you can really detect when your ads are going to have a bad day really early sometimes if there's like holidays or something going on if you're looking at your cpl and some really early stats for example if you have an opt-in page or you're running an e-commerce store you're going to quickly see if ads are not performing this is a little bit more hidden in the details for a call funnel or a longer funnel but you can see this stuff right away if you have an e-com or opt-in funnel and so this is just a general tidbit because i see people committing ad sepuku which is basically a fancy way of saying shooting themselves in the foot with their ads well they don't have to so for example if i'm like looking at my ads right here okay i can really quickly see if i'm going off opt-ins let's imagine this is an opt-in right here if i just scaled my ad and doubled it yesterday or increased by 25 i can really quickly see by like noon if if it's done something bad to my opt-in cpl because what you're going to see with ads and how ads work is as you increase the ad scale what is actually happening a lot of people think that you are targeting one huge audience and that's what's happening but what facebook does and what google does is if you're spending like 20 bucks a day it's gonna know who the best customers are and it's gonna focus on this tiny little demographic and then when you get to like 250 bucks a day you get to like this larger pool and then suddenly your cpl blows up or your your pool is going to be way too small which is what a lot of people do with micro targeting and so it just starts ricocheting all around and spending your budget way more so you can easily see like a three dollar cpl jump to 10 or when you get pushed into a broader market and your ad offer and messaging isn't congruent this is the number one reason why people's facebook ads on scale they work in this really tight niche targeting right here that facebook does for you subtly and then you get into that actual marketplace and you get destroyed this is why people don't scale on youtube they don't scale on facebook if you want help doing that you should book a call with me below because i can fix that like i have for like a zillion people look at all the six seven and eight figure results i have via the link below i'm booking a call like it's easy for me all right so look not to toot my horn but what happens is when people go right here you're gonna see very quickly oh crap my offer stinks you're gonna see it jump to like a 10 cpl like that and people think oh is it because algorithms optimizing or like santa claus came in and just decided to run christmas ads on the same day i increased my budget no it's because you jumped in this market and so i can easily detect this in adwords because i get up at like 4 am like i said by about six seven o'clock in the morning you know i'm gonna see a really ugly cpl and i'm gonna know something's up right there and i'm just gonna reduce the add back i'm not gonna turn the ad off i'm just gonna take it back to its last place where it worked and say okay what's going on here maybe i'll increase it a little bit slower or i'll slow down the ad spend for the day by decreasing it i see so many people they're going to go and increase their budget from 250 a day to 500 and then they check in at noon and like the cp has gone to 15 when it used to be three dollars hint this isn't good and they're like oh well we'll just let it run and so they they let the extra 250 dollars an ad spend run because that's how ads work right no this isn't like going to ruin your life if you do it once or twice but if you do this consistently like three times a month that's like again in this example right here seven or fifty bucks a month wasted you do that over the span of a year you busted out 10k what you really need to do when you're thinking about your ads is you must think about all your ads spent and all your budget over the span of a year because it's very easy to just yolo things and make like little tidbit mistakes that are like one two percent mistakes a few times a week by the end of the year for example when i was running hcom i guarantee these mistakes added up to like a hundred hundred fifty thousand dollars uh when i was spending a lot of money on ads don't do this okay don't do this on top of that over the span of a year again if you're spending 100k a year i guarantee 15k of that doesn't need to be spent and you are literally going to be turning off ads that work at least 15 of the time these are the low end things at least losing you another 15k in profit if you're getting like a 2x ry that's an extra 30k a year low end if you're on a low end ad buying budget where you're only spending 10k a month i mean look at this these are my results tracked in google you can see here's my call phone right google reported one call i had four google report zero i had two google reported one i had one right there nice job google and you can just see from this like really small ad account i would be literally turning off these ads and each call at this one business is worth 900 dollars to me so this ad right here the last just two days super simple super duper simple ad account generated me almost eighteen hundred dollars off of sixty dollars a day in ad spend and i would just look at this and i would turn it off you wouldn't have any idea how crazy this gets an actual ad account to where i'm spending a lot of money or in the e-commerce accounts where they're spending a lot of money or info accounts we're spending a lot of money okay i turn this guy off right here i just gave myself nearly a 30 000 per month the motion in cash so that number's a little exaggerated it's probably like 25k but you get the point of
