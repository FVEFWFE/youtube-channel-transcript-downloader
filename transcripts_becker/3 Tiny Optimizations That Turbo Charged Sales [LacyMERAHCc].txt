hey this is Alex Becker CEO of hire us again if you're not gonna know what I do in these videos is I'm epically bribing you to do business with high risk by just telling you everything that I've learned about running ads and scaling businesses look being the CEO of a tracking company gives me a lot of advantages to know what's working and advertising right now and more importantly I've grown multiple businesses to seven and even eight figures using paid traffic so what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna tell you the most essential things that I know one of these things is these three micro optimizations I'm gonna tell you in this video these little no effort things allowed me to drop the cost per acquisition on my customers by thirty percent without changing a single ad without changing a single landing page without changing any my targeting that product everything stayed the same I think you get it I didn't have to do anything except apply these three things right here and if you applies to your business i would reasonably say you're gonna see a 10% to even 20 maybe even 30 percent drop in how much it cost you to acquire a customer these are that damn powerful and before we get into it if you want to actually track these differences and make sure you're able to spot bads that are actually making money and turn off the ads that are actually losing you money you should go below hit the purple button it'll schedule call to us and we'll show you exactly how to track your ads the right way because well I mean if you're not tracking your ads the right way there is a thirty to forty percent loss in attribution that we see with every single client it comes in the hi rose which causes you to kill your winning edge and caused you to invest money and bad ads that's some bad juju you don't want to run a business like that it's expensive that being said if you actually want help growing your business without you want to see how I grew a single funnel past eight figures on AdWords click the green button below it's gonna take you to a train it shows you two exact ads the exact funnel the exact copy or any scripts even the target I use to grow one of my businesses past eight figures and even blueprints at all for you that being said let's hop into these three micro optimizations so I can show you use them because these things takes ten seconds to apply and it's probably gonna make you an extra ten percent of your business this year let me show you okay guys so we're gonna be looking at two of my best converting landing pages and I'm just gonna give you a bonus tip as it starts off these landing pages you're looking at when it comes to opt-ins it depends if you're doing sales pages it's probably going to look a little bit different these two pages right here these two designs are the best opt-in designs that I've ever used ever across all my years I've tried every single type of opt-in every type of design possible and so the first thing I want to tell you as we get going into this is that ugly always converts best it very very rarely gets out converted by something that's pretty I encourage you to go test this I encourage you to go just try something different they won't work as well 90% of the time if I had 10 bucks I bet on the clean page every single time and the reason for this is that when you send people to a landing page what you need to remember is that they are just browsing there is absolutely no reason for them to stick around there is absolutely no reason for them to check out their business their interest level is at an all-time low in fact they probably are regretting clicking already and it's an extremely important that you catch them with your headline and speak as clearly as possible if you are using a super pretty super fancy looking landing page it'd be like a person walks into your store and there's like fireworks going off there's like all sorts of stuff going on there's there's teddy bears from build-a-bear running around the store like throwing rocks at them it's it's completely overwhelming and then you're in the back of the store saying hey we sell pants and they're not gonna if they're looking for pants they might not hear that and they're gonna get overwhelmed there and be like this is this is odd and they're just gonna go somewhere else that's a little bit of an overstatement but I won't use hyperbole to express that to you because it's like people are walking around the mall and they walk in and you need to have exactly what they're looking for right there if you want to have the maximum conversion rates in fact if they're looking for pants and they walk in your store you just want have a completely empty store with a pair of pants right there that they like so that's the first thing I'm going to tell you now the next thing I'm going to tell you is also a tip that increased my sales by it made or break my funnel so I'm just gonna tell you this right here and it's kind of hard to explain but as you notice whenever we get a person to opt in for anything or we get a person to go through any of our sales pages to start to checkout process the thing that most people forget is their email delivery but let me explain this to you if you're running a webinar you're running an opt-in funnel you're even running a funnel where you collect people's emails after they check out the number one way to increase your business without doing anything special is to get your email off of autoresponders and get it on a dedicated IP in warm and up the right way now what is what does this mean well first off I would just start investigating being on your own dedicated IP address and you want to use a fresh domain name you want to use a fresh domain that you're linking to and you want to start using new content on a dedicated and you want to limit it to only your funnel emails okay to funnel emails that fire from maybe your webinar funnel your opt-in funnel or your banding cart or follow-up funnels why do you want to do this because when you do this these have extremely high open rates and what it does is when you have your own IP address what happens is Google Yahoo Hotmail they all see this IP address coming in they also see your domain name that's being sent from and when you have super high open rates what happens is it goes these guys are good these guys are good what happens when you're on an autoresponder is you're sharing IP addresses with people that are not mailing the right way and what I mean by mailing the right way is if you're sending up big blasts you're mailing your entire list all at once you're not mailing the right way you're not that's what everybody does no one really mails the right way this is why my funnels I have 50 60 percent open rates I have open rates close to messenger and most people can't break 10 percent it's because they're not mailing it right away but the thing is you need to understand is that these these email emails completely control how well your funnel works for example if you have a webinar funnel and your attendance email your join now emails getting a 15 percent open rate your attendance rates are gonna be miserable and your attendance rates control how well your webinar does if you have an opt-in funnel how well that funnel does maybe it's a four day launch funnel maybe it's just an opt-in where they get sold stuff over time how well does is determined by the open rates getting a 15% increase in open rates means a 15% increase in your business same thing with abandoned cards same thing with everything else and so what you need to do is you need to focus on having a dedicated IP and a new domain that you use not the domain you've been blasting from if you've been doing it as your mailing standard and you need to reserve this only for your funnels not your not your mass males to your list because getting if you have a webinar and you have a 15% delivery rate on that first email it goes out but you increase it to 45% 60% your webinar is going almost triple and sales it's going to be huge for you this is one of the easiest micro optimizations you can make and this is something that I do with all my businesses and the funnels if you can see what most of my businesses for example I have a sales call funnel right here that we sell high rose through and it lives and dies by that second email because a lot of people don't finish the first video right here they'll opt then they'll go through and what they'll do is they'll go through my phone right here and they won't watch into this video and they won't have time to fill out the form so what then happens is they don't go through but I have a bunch of follow-up emails and other training that I win them back with that's where almost 50% of my calls come from but the business wouldn't work as well so if I didn't do this stuff I didn't do this stuff now the second tip I'm going to give you is experiment with shorter content this webinar right here does a four xry for me cash before reoccurring payments and anything even comes in it's a great freeze-frame of me as well I'm gonna give you just I'm gonna give you more than three tips right here I'm gonna tell you a really ninja one right here most people on their call funnels have a 45 minute presentation on most people's webinars they have almost like a three hour presentation I've done both of those a minim work but what I found is reducing a webinar almost to 45 minutes if we're just selling on the webinar or reducing a call sales video the 20 minutes has worked like crazy for me also having a link to call right on the page with testimonials has worked really well for me b2b it doesn't work b2c okay but this has worked really well for me now I'm gonna give you another tip that absolutely crushes it when you start running ads get your pages on HTML after split testing and find the perfect page design the perfect headline get this on HTML now I love clickfunnels it's great I you start all my funnels on click phones but soon as I have the the page optimized by text and what's on it I get this stuff off of click phones I put in the HTML and you want to just have a plain HTML page because it loads so much faster and that's going to drop that's going to increase your mobile opt-in conversion rates your mobile sales rates significantly it increased mine it dropped my CPL I was paying about $7 Elite it dropped into about five dollars of lead for me now the final tip I'm gonna give you with your opt-ins you can see this is all just simple stuff we're not having to change any bare-bones of the funnel not have to change anything the other tip I can give you is design your opt-ins for mobile and so what I'm doing right here is whenever I have opt-ins you need to go and look at your opt-ins and look at how they're used on a mobile phone this right here works very well in a mobile phone this opt-in right here works the same if I'm on mobile if I want anything else and it's very sleek and it just goes through like this so the user doesn't have to go and select you a bunch of menus and all sorts of other things like that if you look at for example the standard ever webinar opt-in it's an absolute disaster yet everybody's using it it makes no sense when you have people opting in you only want to have one format at one time and you want to keep the form as simple as possible I only like to I like my forms like this or just clean BAM name email and you want to be as plain-jane as possible don't have anything extra don't have any images or anything else like that on the page that right there also significantly dropped my CPM this form right here on my webinars super drop my CPL I actually copy this from Sam Evans page so I'll cite my sources let's write your super drop my CPL okay I mean you can see how smooth that is compared to other options out there we have something janky popping around or something like that on mobile phones they find every reason in the glitch so you want to have your forms be as simple as possible and one other final bonus tip I'll give you to increase your opt-in rates throw in a type of training or checklist find something that people are really interested in turn it into a template or checklist and throw that in there on top of whatever you're offering in your sales call funnel your opt-in funnels or your webinar funnels these simple things right here will easily drop your CPL but I would say 20 to 30 it did so for me it actually did significantly more once we started getting the email and everything inside and so this is just what I would suggest so guys this is the training day I just want to show you these things because just applying these will really make a huge difference in your business now the wrapt is up but one of the biggest optimization hacks that you can also use is tracking correctly bidding on the right places and spending zero money on the wrong places one of the easiest ways to make more money from your ads that there is if you want help doing that click the purple link below and we'll take you to a train it shows you exactly to do that if you actually want help setting up these optimizations in your business you want to see how I use these optimizations that I've used to actually skill businesses from seven figures to even eight figures click the green button will show you exactly how I buy ads and how I apply these optimizations and step-by-step exactly the targeting the copywriting everything behind how I scaled one of my businesses past eight figures using these exact landing pages and then finally if you want to network with other entrepreneurs that are spending significant amounts enhancement you win our Facebook group below as I filmed this video there is close to ten million dollars a month and ad spend just in that group and it doesn't have any beginners it's not beginner focused it's not for people that are lost who are trying to lead to lost like a lot of other groups that is just pure ad spinners we qualify every single person who comes in so if you spend ad spend head over there so that being said I'm gonna be sending you another training here in a few days that's gonna show you some of my hyper ROI YouTube tact it's gonna show you some of the most low lying fruit on YouTube ads right now it's gonna show you how to pick those up you can easily generate a 3 X 5 X ROI off of a hundred 200 bucks a day using this and build a very full-time business or scale your business or add another revenue stream to your business just by using these hyper ROI tactics they're super easy to use nobody really spots these things and what we're doing is we find really low hanging fruit on YouTube and we just place ads on these or nobody else is placing them and they're so targeted that just it just works like gangbusters so I'm going to show you those hyper optimizations in our next training video it's Ben Becker CEO of hi Russ I'll see you then
