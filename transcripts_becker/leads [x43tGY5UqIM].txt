alright hey there buddy old pal this is Becker again and we're going to be getting into you how to use your lead section right now since you have asked for help so what I want to show you how to do is how to use the lead section and what this section does is two main things one it allows you to find segments of your lead search for leads find whose active who's not basically fine all the info you need to know about your leads and put certain people in certain places and then it also allows you to do is calculate the amount of money that you've earned from those leads so for example right here if I want to go search for a specifically and we're gonna start with the most basic use of this and get down to the more complicated uses of it now first things first let's get into how to actually import leads okay it's that super simple but you're gonna go out here and you're just gonna grab a CSV file so I'm gonna grab this one right here and how it works and let me just open up the CSV file for you is what's gonna happen is you gonna import your CSV file and you're gonna have the columns in the CSV file let me open it up so you can see what it looks like okay so we have the CSV file open right here and these are all fake emails so don't worry about that that's just an example emails but what we have is different columns right here and you can set columns for whatever you want so if we want to put all the people's emails in this column all their corresponding names and lastname and these columns you can totally do that super cool what I usually just do is I import the email so it's just straight up so you won't have a column that has all your emails on it so after you import it you're gonna see when you upload it all the different columns that are in your CSV file so I'm gonna go right here and mark this one as you know so that's what it is that's gonna tell the system its email then we're gonna fill a little bit of information right here so first off we want to tag it leads so I'm gonna mark these as source with okay adding it to my source wave list right here now and what we want to do right here that might confuse you a little bit is we want to go and look at your previous mailings of these emails on your previous mailing platform okay a lot of other mailers or autoresponders they won't even let you import leads or they're gonna call you in the phone or they're gonna talk to you or they're gonna do all sorts of things to make sure the leads you're importing are good leads okay and that improves the improve ability or the deliverability of the entire system so what we want to do is streamline that we don't have to call you on the phone we don't have to talk to you we don't have to like expect you or anything like that if you just give us access to your previous mailing platform our staff can go in make sure that you've explored the list the right way make sure you exported all your active leads not unsubscribe people that are gonna complain and stuff like that and um make sure that you're bringing leads you're gonna get a lot of success within the system now this is optional you can import the leads and not give us your information but you're gonna need to talk to our staff and you're gonna tell us need to tell us where these leads are coming from and we're gonna need to talk to you about it because we can't have you coming in and importing twenty five thousand people that you have no business emailing which some people will do and that's why we yeah and this system right here now if you don't want to play by these rules you can simply integrate with Amazon SES and you can send from your own email server that's completely fine we'll allow you to do that but if you want to send from our server we just simply need you to do this we're not gonna go and do anything weird inside your mailing platform we're just gonna make sure that you've emailed these leads in the past and you are these are people that you're actually talking to you so I'm just gonna put like Aweber right here I'm gonna put just a fake user name fake password and a contact number we can call you app if we need to talk to you now after you import your leads what's usually gonna happen is we have people watching the imports 24/7 you're gonna see a little pop-up right here and our staff is gonna message you just asking a little bit about your leads and then they'll approve the leads for you to mail it's that easy it's that simple that's all there is to it so let's actually get into you actually using the lead system the fine leads and import leads and getting more you know complicated stuff so if I wanna go in just search for an email for example I can just go up here and if I know there's a specific email on my list I can just go look it up right here and then if I want to do anything to that email I can simply select it I can do a whole bunch of things I can delete it I can export it I can add tags to it I can remove tags from it I can generate and see exactly how much that email is actually spent with me you can see this this dude actually has not spent anything so I can also go no I don't want to delete the lead but you can see how easy it is to go and do that so if I want to go all right here and I want to search for tags with a certain or leads with a certain tag I just click are here to click show results and you can see right here it shows me all these leads now if I want to I can go generate the LTV and you can see it's ten cents per lead right here now I just upload this list the other day the usual math I make per lead from this list is like $15 per lead or something like that but the six months of tracking is in there quite yet so now what we can also do is a lot more advanced segmentation for example we can go and say source wave and I can say anybody who's bought the product let's just say this offer right here okay and so I can go and I can do anybody that has both these tags okay so what it's gonna show is three of them alright so I can see right here the exact value for each of these leads to 749 dollars if you can see I okay I can see these two these people bought our Herer have this tag and have bought this proc so you can see I can use this describe a lot of things now I can also go and say okay let's get everybody that has a tax source way but hasn't bought this products I can go right here and go like OMG op store we can do this with tags too I'm just doing a products right here and it will pull up a list of people that haven't buzz so let's say a lot of people on my list have gone and bought a certain product I don't want to market them again with that type of off right there so we'll give me a segment of my list I can go and work with and I can go right here and I can send the email to musing this this option to send email to this segment is not currently here yet but should be here when you hop in and I can add tags to these people and I can remove tags and do whatever I want so we can basically describe any type of lead in this situation now we can click right here on advanced and we can go and find everybody that's do you know has opened in the past four months so if we want to clean and get rid of everybody that hasn't opened what we can do is we can simply go and say all right these people have opened in the last four months or so we ran a specific tag to them and then anybody that doesn't have that tag we just delete from our list or we move into like a dead email segment of our list we can see the last click date and we can see who's unsubscribe basically everything you get everyone know so if I want to see like everybody complained on my email list it will show 18 contexts and so I don't want these people on my email list okay so what I'm gonna do right now I'm just gonna delete them because these people you know complain when they receive emails so those people are gone forever so you can see how I'm easily going through my list and in finding any type of segment any type of description any type of person on my list and then building it like that it's very cool it's very flexible and while it's very simple you can go super deep with it so I could be like anybody that has this this tag and the source wave tag has all these tags and I'm not sure people have it doesn't have like the tag let's just say Alex Beckham you all right and so I can do that no one's going to show up on that right there because there's no combination but we can just get as deep into the segmenting as you want now the last thing I want to show you that we've already touched on but I just want to go over it is if you click right here and you go okay I want to get rid of that people have a complaint I just delete everyone a complaint so I want to show sealed active people to have the source wave tag so you can see right here boom and what we're going to do now is we can go and generate the LTV for everybody on here so give it one sec and so we'll go on show us the long-term value so this is really important when you're building out your ads and you're saying okay so everybody who came through the specific funnel let's say we tagged somebody the second they enter one of our opt-ins oh we can see exactly how much they spent and as they are on our list longer longer you're going to see the value of that email increase as if people keep buying more and more stuff from you so that's super important when it comes to growing your ads and advertising that's one of the most beautiful things about market here we're gonna have a lot more functions coming in that show you like the amount of time it takes to get the LTB how much they spend over time so you'll see how much you earn on 1 week 2 week 3 weeks on average a lot of other cool stuff like that but this is how you use the lead section if you have any questions be sure to just hit up our super friendly awesome support right here and they'll
