[Music] hey what's going on welcome to video 3 here are just one video after this away from the t-shirt and getting my entire paid funnel that I've been using imported into your system so listen up stay tuned we're just we're almost done here so what we're going to do in this video is build our basic optins and our basic email funnels now inside the system when you get inside there's a much more detailed explanation if you can't figure out how to do this on your own I feel a lot of people will be to figure it out cuz it's so simple but if you need or need any more information there's going to be a little bubble down here that you can click that will show you all the videos and everything you can do to use this in advanced ways but let's start off with a basic funnel slil stream so we're going to click new stream right here and what you're going to do is you're going to create your first optin right here so what the optin is going to do is it's going to build an optin for you now you can do a bunch of different things right here for the optin button that you use you can go and create a button that will have a drop down you can use an image instead you can use a link uh you you can even go and create your own HTML code from it uh that will generate when you build it out here and you can go and paste that HTML code anywhere so if I want to go here and I set this button to be like this um and I go to preview and I remove the first name and last name so you can see this is what this is what's going to drop down when people click it but I'm going to remove the first and last name I could even go over and click okay right here and go to the form it'll give me an HTML code I can use to embed in lead Pages or any opt-in form system you're using however our system does it just as well and how it's going to work is just like this you can see boom pops down gives us an optin right here this is what converts the highest however if you have your own forms and stuff like that you can always just embed our HTML into that so um this is done simply by going and grabbing the embed code that market hero is going to spit out to you and you just embed it wherever you want in your site so we'll create that button if you use an image you can create your own button that will be used instead of what was used in an image heck you can even just create a text link that will bring down a drop down for you so that's how it is people go into the system and very simple so then what you can do right here is we want to go and I'm going to apply a tag to let me know that people opted in through this optin so I'm going to make a new tag that says Market Hero Test optin so anybody that comes in through this optin will be tagged with this tag and so I can easily go search them up later on and calculate how much money they've made me or just see who joined through this optin so then what I want to do is I want to add an email that will be sent to the person so go right here we can send one email and then I'm going to have it go in I'm just going to I'm going not really fill this out because we don't really need to do all this and I'm not going to get into the email Builder too much we'll get into the next video and I'm just going to hit save okay so let's imagine then I want to uh let's just say apply another tag right here I actually want to sort by tag uh and so everybody that comes in I want to go two directions so let's have an email right here let's have an email right here actually we'll put a delay right here and this is where I'm going to show you just the basic automation Side Market hereo so let's say we want to sort by the market Hero Test tag that we created all right so we can go right here and we can go and type in right there so let's say that the person has that tag and so if they do have the tag they'll get sent here if they don't have the tag they'll get sent here very simple um and so then I can go here to delay and I can set wait at least 3 days and I can set a specific time or whatever for it to run and then I can have them get sent this email so look what's been done right here very simple to use person opts in Market hero tag is applied to them they're send an email then it sorts them by the market hero tag that was applied to them in a yes no situation if they have the tag which they will cuz we applied it right here they'll go to this delay they'll wait 3 days they'll get an email they don't have the tag which won't happen in this situation but just showing the automation they'll get this email and so that's how we go and build our basic email funnels that's how we go and create our opin you just created this crazy automated Advanced thing in just two seconds right here in Market hero and that's what we're all about so this is how this works there'll be much deeper instructions if you click the little bubble that will show up right here in every tab there's a little button that shows you more detail instructions on how to use it but that's how it works so this is been Becker you have one more video to go and that's it so let's get on to that right now I'm going to show you to send your broadcast and do some basic lead segmenting it's going to allow you to do some really cool segmenting and advanced mailing and whatever else you want to do so see you in the next video
