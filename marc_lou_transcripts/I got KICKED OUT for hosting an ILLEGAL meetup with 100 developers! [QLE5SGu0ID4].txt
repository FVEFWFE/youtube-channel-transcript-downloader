================================================================================

in my case the key for this was to try to live an unusual life Wow 2024 everything compounded this is so crazy I'm I'm extremely nervous [Music] mental and don't forget to put this freaking pay and I hope you had a good time Mark time to open the YouTube Silver we've been waiting for so long open it okay okay this so beautiful it's weird to receive package from YouTube we started YouTube like January this year than all right oh wow YouTube made a welcome letter what do it say do you remember your first subscriber your 100th or your thousands keep creating keep building oh wow they it feels like the YouTube see sent me a liter so keep creating keep building we can't wait to see what you'll do next and we're here to support you along the way and who knows when you reach your millionth subscriber you may just write to you and ask do you remember your 100,000 subscriber wow that is it the silver it's super legit wait that's beautiful presented to Maru for passing 100,000 subscribers yeah so how how do you feel I grew up with YouTube like my University my teacher everything is YouTube from copyrighting marketing just even coding like most of my coding skills come from YouTube like this has been a long for a while like I would watch Youtubers with this stuff in the background and you know you kind of Imagine like wow that must be such a cool life to have this in your background this guy must be crushing it and just seeing it in real like it's I'm one of them now that's is so crazy I'm just I don't know I'm also okay it's time bragging time but I'm also very proud of me of course you've been showing up every day i' been making a YouTube video once a week even though you work full time on your app yeah this man Honestly YouTube is one of the least unexpected events that happened this year because the entire Journey started from like close to zero followers in January and pass 100K 2 months ago or something less than 10 months from Z to 100K and knowing that this is not my full-time job like this is a habit every Saturday I would make a video and only on Saturday I would wake up in the morning I have to find an idea an interesting angle a thumbnail an intro and shoot the entire video and be done by the end of the day and I stick to that habit since January this year and this happened I didn't quit I didn't quit at the beginning nothing was happening to month month was nothing like I made 10 videos it was nothing any tips to make a video like that you like to make but also people like to watch that's an interesting one I think the I think I'm um I'm not the typical YouTuber because I'm not a content creator I I just try to leave A Life That's unusual and make content out of it so my life is the story I don't create a story my life is the story and we tried to package it in a YouTube videos that hopefully feels like a better story but the key I think the key for this in my case the key for this was to try to live an unusual life and for that that means building stuff that people normally don't build um I don't know like doing Health routine that people normally don't follow this is what is behind this YouTube button yeah try to leave something that fills you and that not everybody is living try to make something different and try to stick to it long enough so that becomes your identity and people will identify you as the guy who does this can you show me one more time squ then press if I drop him we get Legacy earlier foreign speee spee I'm on the train to go to the south of friends from Paris to visit some relatives so I'm taking some time to break down things that happened recently so okay first for the launch of data fast it's been now 30 days exactly and it made 300,000 in Revenue which is absolutely mind- glowing it's by far the best product I've ever built and now that some students start to finish the course they start to get results and build their own websites and some even get users and customers that really makes me so happy I am also breaking down everything I achieved in 2024 and as a comparison this is my salary since I got fired from my software engineer job so literally nothing happened for the first 2 years I was just barely surviving then something took off in 2023 and in 2024 everything compounded I had no idea I would create a baller plate I had no idea I would make a course I actually had no idea what would happen I just knew that if I stick to something maybe eventually something will happen and let me um um be financially independent so I've just planted a bunch of seed like from the moment I got fired I I I made all those like 25 plus websites and then eventually at some point some of those website took off and created a little story and compound it if we take a software like Indie page for instance which is a little Link in BIO tool um it started earlier back in 2022 he was he was making roughly like couple hundred a month and just because I posted on the internet people gave me feedback they wanted to see some features and I just listened to my users and I started to implement those features one of them they wanted to see is an SEO backlink and the revenue kept growing because of that feature it's a matter of consistency showing up it's a matter of not giving up and listening to users and staying in the game long enough until it happens to you there's a quote that says we overestimate what we can achieve in one day but we underestimate what we can achieve in one year and this could summarize exactly my journey I never believe I would be able to build so many startups but I've have been showing up every single day and eventually something happened if you believe in yourself and show up consistently this can be your journey too you can do it V I recently was asked which feature should I prioritize for my software and usually I put them into two buckets the product features and the growth features and I split my time 50% for each bucket for instance for this little uh piece of software that I built and for all of the product features I have one goal in mind is to reduce the churn I just go to my stripe dashboard and I look at the subscriber turn rate and my goal is to make it go as low as possible and when you mix reducing turn and building features you end up building features your users want and for that I have built in my software again a little um feedback board page where my users can submit whatever they want to see in the product they can also up vote what other people post and so as a business owner I know exactly what my users want then I just list all of them by priority and I build them into the product for instance the one I working on right now is to let people search their uh analytics for a custom date wrench the goal with the product features bucket is to make people love the product so much that they don't want to churn and then there's is the other bucket which I call the growth features bucket it's features that users normally don't request it's more like my creative brain wants to add something uh because I think it might be valuable for my users one of them for instance which I shipped recently is uh in the email report use my users get from data fast at the bottom there is a growth Insight which is like an AI that is trained on the data from my customers to help them understand some patterns and how to make more money from some specific marketing channels this is not something I can ask my users because this is something I can only guess from my mind and the goal with this kind of bucket is to try a new vertical for my product to try to um find something that makes the product so good because it has this specific feature that my users will want to spread the word about it that I can update the lending page copy and say that this product can also do that which is amazing um it has some sort of like a grow business growth or virality embedded into it and I just split my time 50% improving the actual product and 50% adding new features and this is how somehow on data fast I'm able to increase the number of active subscribers without losing much of them and I'm not 100% sure where this is going to go but that's the blueprint I trust to grow this software to a million doll in valuation finally this Sunday we're going to have some first meet up in Paris oh yes no this is this is two days right yes this is totally mad look 500 likes okay BR this is so crazy we just thought it would be nice to meet people behind the camera who are into like making apps and building little startups on the internet and I make a random tweet with a form for to submit just you know if you want to meet us like we open meet up actually I feel it's a very unplanned un nothing we don't have a script we don't have a place it's like open Meetup in the middle of Paris and I just posted that the Tweet got 500 likes which is a lot and then the four 130 people wow 13 people coming in the Jan l yeah we thought like just 10 to 20 people sign up then it would be amazing because we posted very in the last minute and it's out it's like 3° outside it might be raining it's outdoor there's no splend or whatever 130 people actually we we might do it again in Bali and New Zealand very soon and I think if we both like it we can create like a even schedule of places where you're going to go even we're going to organize and I still don't know exactly how to structure the event but at least we can you know organize them in advance people can register and eventually we get to meet someone across the world yeah why you're concerning no serly this is going to be a mess we are 200 participants for the Meetup are going to manage everyone I I rely on you you're the one me yes I am I'm developer you know like uh you know I you the social person here how can I speak to 200 people in open space I think we we really I think we clearly underestimate how big 200 people is and let's say only 50% of them come that's 100 people and Mark is super nervous it's his first time like a speaking from dness I'm I'm extremely nervous I'm extremely nervous well you got this it's going to be fine people love you and people all want hear the story I hope it's valuable for people who are coming I really hope so y see you there we can I think we will make like two to three minutesand I'm not radio programmer I have take the Cod fast course of Mark maybe one month ago this is why I was really jealous of you guys because uh you can just take your ideas and bringing to life computers and I cannot so that's why I take the course of Mark it was really help so maybe some testimonials life testimonials so because uh programming it's uh really complicated for people who don't have the code uh it's a really hard to understand the the full picture and the course really help me because uh it takes everything maybe on the surface and uh and help me have the big picture understand what is really uh building a product8 years8 years oh okay 8 years have problem uh the lesson is even if the app is a very very simple app you don't know what user is actually going to Value so just ship it sh uh it was inspired a lot by this community so thanks everybody who is doing this crazy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] uh it's um yeah it's a huge motivation thank you everything and don't forget to put this freaking payable I'm poine and I started to create SAS I think three years ago uh with many failures I created websites Etc but uh each time I started a project I just abandoned just start if you have an 0 so and uh by the way it's to uh stick with it uh share your journey because when you are sharing people are here to help you to give you advice if you do everything in the shadow nobody will know and of course you're ID will remain secret but uh if you don't want your ID to be secret if you want to earn money with it so just uh ship it don't overthink and uh talk a lot about your project because everybody can help how do you find a good idea okay so I think yes I tried many different topics like I tried to create a fun Instagram account I tried crypto I tried b2c and I think product that was failure wasn't a failure at the end because it teached me a lot when you think your idea is good when you have idea how to Market it try to do things but if it doesn't bring any traction just for at a certain moment just drops the idea I think we just had a meet up I just talked to Fabian and Carlos and they all say I mean not all but some people say they came they took a flight to come to this meet up that's crazy yeah it was it was just a tweet in my head it was just a tweet and people really loved it it's like everybody thanks for thank you so much for coming it was absolutely amazing and we got this gift one gift is actually one I think it's a book one is actually for you oh really yeah oh so kind oh what book is it it's ads from like a old collection of ads oh that's love Yeah Bo love your creativity this is such a nice gift oh Mar want to say oh I think this one maybe oh it's in French what Walt oh Walt Disney autobiography I think no I think he sketches and maybe the his story maybe well everybody we met today all had the desire to build their own abs and you know have this entrepreneurship freedom and I think about half of them is making money on the internet already already wow that was really impressive how many people came today I think we were we were 100 we have yeah we have to show like right now boom footage of the group photo yeah mental so how did you feel meeting all those people you know real life we'll do it again we'll do you again yeah yeah I'll be more prepared I guess it feels good I think it feels good for everyone most of most of people the thing the number one thing they mentioned is please create a group and do it again m M I think I think there is there's something I think there's you know this it's you you feel lonely somehow in the journey I do feel lonely in and I think people were happy to connect with others mhm so yeah we we'll do it again yeah look at where we're going to the mission Star restaurant in Paris I'm really happy we can give the nice lunch experience to our family as Christmas gift go back to Bali it's time to Surf oh okay we are in Paris airport we are going back to Bali we're late uh this is
