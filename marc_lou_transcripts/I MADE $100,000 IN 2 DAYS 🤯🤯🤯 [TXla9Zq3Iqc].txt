================================================================================

we launched 36 hours ago $68,000 relx what took you so long just sh a new feature should I [Music] click blue pill or the red pill I just shipped a new feature on ship fast it's called Perks it's basically a list of discounts for popular products I'm so happy cuz I was able to work with versal which is one of the most common hosting platform out there as well as some really cool other products I'm about to add another one called recent to send emails and the entire bundle is worth over $1,000 in discount I'm carefully handpicking product that either help people save money or make more money cuz my goal is to help a th000 makers make $1,000 online and also now at the same time on my landing page I can say things like this where I can show how much worth of discounts people can expect to get and that makes the price of the ball plates looks cheap compared to that so I hope that will improve a little bit the conversion rate okay so we are two days before black Friday everything was planned and scheduled and I do the last checkup with my friends I always do that whenever I launch a new startups I always send it to a couple of my friends ask what they think about it because when I build a learning page I'm always in my head and sometimes I don't see things and it would be a terrible mistake if I just ship the startups as it is so I ask a few people around me what they think about it and this is not good ah I was really convinced that the landing page was great like good enough to launch and all my friends from different background told me it is not good at all like really I got really poor feedback uh the problem is I have 2 days left I I just don't I I I don't even know what I will have time to do build it launch it wow you're man my heart just m be like crazy all right I want to see where surf brings the cardio level I don't think I get this exhausted when I surf what's the next so we made the cardio heat goes up next is a little bit of muscle strengths I do planks then I usually do at pull-ups push-ups push-ups and 40 pull-up chein up for 20 pull-up 20 whatever and uh that's it it's either cardio at home or surf which also does the cardio and build muscles but then I don't really leave we apart really sometimes so I try to have always like those CH up P up push-up Etc so I do a little bit of strength as well not just cardio since I didn't do any ABS I'm going to do a little bit this it's I'm going to say something very controversial but I think my strength is my laziness because I know I would never be able to go to the gym I know I would never have the courage to go to the gym and do the communting and spending two hours and thinking about the gym because I'm lazy and I don't want to do that I try to find my own constraints and rules in my laziness bubble interesting because people need to investment to feel more motivated they need that membership to show up if is a home they be EAS it to compromising it's a really good point it's a really good I think it come it boils down to how you are like what how what's your way of doing things the book Atomic habits James Clear mhm one of the first book I read after after I didn't read any books because High School make me hate reading it's prob the first book I read and it says they make it so easy you can't say no and that's that's very true like start with 10 push-ups per day beginning new what took you so long I guess your 9 to5 became a 9 to9 this is where people realize I am 12 years old this is my favorite part of launching startups is you know I haven't done any of those videos this year the last one it was with mat Maki no go everywhere Dad they are my friends I talk to them oh for logo Fest which was December last year logo Fest the fre you made 5,000 in 3 days yes that's it one why do you make the video before lunch because the internet is crowded and at some points if you want to get your message across the room you have to find something that feels like you mhm that people will give their time to watch what you have to offer and because of that they'll give me like a minute of their time to look at what I have to offer and it happens that eventually if they're learning if they're trying to learn how to code they might watch like they might visit the site and might even purchase and I think the the purpose of this video is eventually to get attention in a way that feels genuine that feels like my way of getting attention basically CH P found the right movie for me I know what I'm going to sell I know roughly you know the angle the angle is very important once we talk again is I'm not making just another course and you're making the course to learn to code for entrepreneurs not employees entrepreneurs this is very important because then you can dit 90% of all the stuff you have to learn when you're a software engineer or an employee so it's a minimal course that teach you everything you need to know to go from zero to a software I think when you I mean like most people I guess you eat around 2 hours before bed M you eat that 700 and you go to bed at 9:00 or you eat at 8:00 you go to bed at at 10:00 we used to do that and then we started to do 6: and 5: p.m. 3 4 5 hours before bed and we realize that when we go back to the original 2 hours before bed the heartbeat is actually racing M and when you do four five hours before it's like you're much more relaxed data says we have better deep sleep and I feel much better as well MH you do feel any difference after I don't see much difference between five and 7 hours like we do now yeah for us I think the big shift is at least 4 hours before bed you're done 4 hours before bed you don't touch any food even not water so you don't go to toilet when you wake up now it's 8:00 p.m. still rolling man we never working that late yeah we normally finish work at least at 6 and wow a long day I think it's honestly one of the stress most stressful lunch I've ever done yeah yeah I'm launching late because of Black Friday like I have a deadline and so I have to check every little thing like there's so many things like from check out to customer dashboard that there's no you know like everything is responsive it's like works on mobile like crazy just crazy do you think you will ever make it today Black Friday I I there's no way I don't make it yesterday I was actually yesterday was a big failure who were supposed to launch yesterday I I realized I don't know anything like I thought it would take me one day to make the video and it took me 2 days and now I'm like super late still the countdown 4 hours I'm going to release okay so now right now I'm literally this is the Tweet I'm about to click publish it goes live Twitter thread LinkedIn whatever and then I'm going to use cod fast uh data fast to monitor the traffic on COD fast how many month of work this is 9 month of work in the making one click for 9 month should I click oh what I clicked I clicked it's publishing wa the first sale alert oh man that makes you so happy it is not a z product so it's time to check the revenue Bo it's it's not even 24 hour yet 23k 17 hour 23k I've never seen I mean holy this is D first dashboard $1,000 in the last 24 hours she first doing great and this is absolute Madness oh my God my man I mean look at that it's spread across the world French people what's happening look at that we launched 36 hours ago one day and a half ago 68,000 honestly I don't know if it's real no way what the hell man there's no way there's no way honestly I'm happy you're recording this because this is this will never happen again this is just insane wait me we sent 11,000 visitors on Coast 11,000 visitors and it makes 50k it's like a 4 $4 per visitors if you're more than $1 that's amazing and $4 is a god level 2% conversion rate on a product that cost at minimum 150 bucks all mostly Twitter mostly Twitter yeah wow 7,000 from Twitter wow that's a lot oh so 7,000 visitors yeah that's that's quite a lot yeah wow there's so many people who didn't know how to code following you and wanting to man this is so yeah this is so crazy yeah that makes me so happy man one of the best moments I I like most Joy I feel cuz I mean this is extremely happy but this will like f like dopamine you know like tomorrow we'll fade away but seeing from all those students a lot of them will follow the entire course and do something and get results and that's what happened with sheep fast and the she fast testimon the greed of love like the wall of Love on cheep fast is probably it's honestly my happiest place to go on the internet go there and I see all those people who at some point trusted me give me a little bit of money and then got RS and like thank you Mark I quit my job thank you Mark I make my first doll on the internet like I love making software but digital product and info product like this how much happiness it brought to the person who make the the info product crazy crazy crazy crazy I got in the bank and I the simple analytics [Applause] guys oo where oh a little hello I am still sick but we're doing it anyway uh it's been almost 7 days I launched cast and this is a little recap of what happened uh it made close to $200,000 us in a week and this is absolutely mental I had no idea it would work this well I knew it would work somehow I'll show you why later but this much man this is just crazy so I want to break down a few things about marketing and finding ideas first let's quickly look at the launch uh you can see here uh this is number of visitors so almost 50,000 visitors and uh whooping $4.4 generated per visitor which is again this is insane I've never had this before the best product I've had was ship fast and he was close to $2 per visitor at his best so this here shows me like there is something big coming Revenue wise it's mostly coming from Twitter uh YouTube and a little bit of LinkedIn and I guess Google or people who've heard of it on social media and search for it I'm PR impressed by how spreaded it is there there's like purchases from a little bit all over the planet which makes me very happy so um I saw this tweet from Max a couple days ago that he thought the course would never sell and there are a few things at play here the first one is when we come up with ideas on what's to build what is what could be a promise promising idea you want to check a few boxes one of the first one is you want to build something that solve your own problems I see too many people coming up with what if I combine this Tech Plus that market and I make a product out of nowhere the problem with that is like it's pure blind guesses and well it's fun you can ship an idea in one week but but the odds of success are very unlikely product like this one's invoice this is not making crazy amount of money if we look at it is making around $1,000 per month but it's zero maintenance zero customer support it's fully on autopilot and it's working like clockwork every single month and I know it would work because I experience the issue I know that when I pay invoices on stripe I have to give them 4% to generate a PDF and so by solving my own problem could potentially guess that some other people have the same issue as me and so that almost guarantees me that if I build a product I will have customers now I knew how to code already I don't need a course to learn how to code the reason I came up with this idea is because I have a YouTube channel and I read every comments on this YouTube channel and one of my best performing videos if you search for how to you end up on finding gems on what people want to achieve how to buy domain name for your project how to build this amazing UI Builders how to make a responsive website how to make those websites seeing these comments over and over tells me that people somewhere on the internet have a problem and it appears that I have the solution cuz I know how to code and this this is how I came up with the idea of code fast a course that teaches people how to code to build those tiny businesses if you go to udm and you search for JavaScript or react you will find hundreds of Great Courses already so with SC fast I knew that there was a huge demand and I also knew that the market is very competitive and when you enter a competitive market you want to have one marketing angle you you want to have you want to find one thing that sets you apart from all the other competitors and the good part is I use UD me myself to teach myself how to code and I remember seeing those courses where you would have 68 hours of content for JavaScript and then you would have 70 hours of content for no JS and another 30 hours to learn HTML and then in the end you would have like a package of like 300 hours to learn how to code the reason those courses are so long is because they are main for people who want to have a job and since the job market is a zero sum game which means that if your neighbor gets the job you won't get the job you have to compete on who has the most skills so in this case it makes sense to to learn as much as you can so you can compete better against others but the thing is in my case I only care about making tiny websites on the internet I just want to be me my computer a few of my customers and that's it I'm not I don't intend to build a massive app for millions of people that requires a team of software engineer to handle and because of that those courses here are like a pain for me I don't want to go over 300 hours of content and this is how I came up with this idea of a course that would teach people only the minimum the the those core skills needed in order to build a tiny internet business and just like this I had one marketing angle that set me apart from all the other alternative and on top of that I remember when I learned how to code it was a pain to search for what should I learn what is Javascript what is HTML how those those thing combine together what is a back end what is a front end I had to think about how the the entire thing works what I did with cast is I bundled everything I explained uh students how to go from literally zero to an actual finished product is not about a specific part on the journey it's about the entire Journey which I bet is one of the reason the launch was so successful and then there is another one mistake that I see lots of people making my friend Yuri asked me what would you do with the money and then it made me think okay if I don't have to work for money what would I do with it and I realized that actually I want to build an alternate school for kids who were not good at school or for people who just don't feel like life Clicks in in general like like finding a job or like working for a big company or whatever for people who just you know want the freedom of not being dependent on others just have a computer and be free that is for some reason what is driving me and if you look at the Journey of everything I built everything resonate with what I want to do what goal I want to achieve now if we look with one of my very first product which was called viral buts it's a little software that uh that made my first internet dollar and then somehow let me move to Bal because he was making a little bit of money here I was helping escape room businesses get more money it was like a marketing tool for businesses and he worked he made a couple thousand per month but it did not resonate with me I have close to zero care for the escap room businesses I I don't specially care about them I care about people who want to do s with their computers but a business I'm not so sure and these product never really took off because once again it was not align with things I do things I like and I see lots of people out there who again are trying to combine uh this tech for that market but they don't care about the tech they don't care about the market and they try to make something out of that but I feel like there's a sort of like a a power that knows how much the product resonate with you what is the fit from the thuner and the product and I think if you want to get reach you have to do something that aligns with yourself okay now talking about marketing um of course having an audience on Twitter and YouTube really helps launching products but uh if you can see here this tweet got 1.3 th000 likes this is the only promotion I've done for the course and it would never ever get half a million views if I didn't have make this video here it's a skit where I play morphus in Matrix and I try to convince Neo Who currently has a 9 to5 job to quit his job and learn to code for himself the reason I did this is first because I absolutely love making this kind of videos but also because it works well it's like an ad that's pleasurable to watch and even though you're not necess interested in what I have to sell you might want to share this to a friend because it's fun and that's how this tweet went viral and got half a million views the launch part of your product is very important you want to uh craft everything to be perfect when you launch and just like in real life where conversion rate matters that improve the actual conversion rate of the product so even though you don't have an audience you can play around with writing a beautiful story of how you came up with this product idea you can go on figma and create a beautiful chart that explains your product you can make something that gives a good first impression for your product okay now I'm talking about what is next for cut fast uh at the moment I'm recovering from my sickness I couldn't work for the past 3 days I've set up an affiliate program where um people can uh become Affiliates and then they would earn 30 30 to 30% commission to 50% commission uh since the conversion rate is really good on the site Affiliates are already making lots of money at the moment I think they're making over $1,000 per day I added this little uh slider here that gives an idea of how much money you can make if you get I don't know let's say five people trying the course you can make actually 300 bucks and at the same time I am trying Facebook ads so uh the campaign has been running for just a couple days I think the first day Facebook was learning who is the audience and then now the results are pretty impressive yesterday was $60 per purchase today is $13 per purchase which is extremely good really actually really really really good uh it's early to tell how far they would go for now I'm only spending I think uh $70 per day for The Campaign which is not uh much but I think in this case it's worth the try because the product converts really well and I've had luck with ship fast in the past where I would spend $50 and get $150 uh in revenue for this I am not alone my good friend Nico janen is helping me run those ads is excellent at Facebook ads and he buil this little guide here called makers guide uh which I vot and it's excellent it teaches you everything you need to know to make good ads on Facebook so if you have a product that you think is worth sharing through ads definitely check it out it's a masterpiece and then as soon as I'm recovered I am going to work on the AI teacher so I want to train an AI on the course so it knows the captions it knows where the student is in the course at the moment it knows the code of the course and is able to help the students learn whether it's explain things or debug when students are stuck I guess I'll will need a little bit more of those Ginger cheese we're so back oh my God spent an entire week I was sick and it's the first night of sleep where I sleep properly and that was a crazy week I wish I was nut sick and enjoyed a little Bard but still the week was completely crazy I know some of you got the course out there thank you for that and I'm very excited for your coding Journey learning how to Cod change my life I hope he does the same for you um I'm going for a surf session one of the last of the year because we're going to Portugal with my wife in a couple of days uh if you're in Portugal I'll be around AR area and Lisbon just drop me a DM somewhere on Twitter and maybe we can do something the this is one of the happiest moments of my life and it only happened 27 times there we go my man there we go that's my 20 27th I think project whatever they're not all on the wall but all the ones that I built recently are there and uh this this little portfolio of small bits is growing EX excited for 2025 I almost forgot this is likely to be the end the final vlog of the year so it's good time to wish you a merry Christmas if you celebrate and of all just a happy New Year and crush it for 2025 until the next one I hope you keep shipping
