[Applause] This is crazy. 5.6%. &gt;&gt; I'm dying. The most painful moment of my life. If things don't change, I will just burn out. &gt;&gt; How much is our MR now? 55K, man. &gt;&gt; That's crazy. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I am so freaking happy. There is one biomarker to track is V2 max. Let's get a V2 max list. [Music] What is he doing? Mark, what are you doing? I thought you were working. &gt;&gt; You were waiting for that moment. I knew it. Okay, I can explain. &gt;&gt; No, you're busted, man. &gt;&gt; I have a really good excuse. I don't code anymore. AI codes for me. And when I wait for the AI to code, instead of checking my phone, I lift this dumbbell. AI is working and I am lifting. It's a new world, man. Okay. So, AI is my husband now. Okay. I think we have to go. We're about to leave. &gt;&gt; Oh, true. What time is the flight? &gt;&gt; Very soon in few hours. &gt;&gt; Okay. 5 minutes. &gt;&gt; 5 4 3 2 1 Heat. Heat. Oh wow. You can put your stuff inside. &gt;&gt; It's the seats and the luggage at the same time. Viva Korea. &gt;&gt; Viva Korea. And even we can order here. &gt;&gt; Wow. So good. Healthy veggies and protein and bar. &gt;&gt; This is the first Korean meal in the last 6 months. I think &gt;&gt; it's so good. &gt;&gt; It is so good. Yeah. I'm starving and it's hot. So hot outside. We're going to be here for 30 days. &gt;&gt; Your parents are going to take care of us like we're 12 years old. We're going to spoil what is amazing in the cell bar. You can refill all the side dishes here. &gt;&gt; Excuse me. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. I Korean girl. &gt;&gt; I'm getting into the Korean style with those umbrellas. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You mean you're into Korean skin care, the boy, the sunlight, sunscreen, and the sun umbrella. &gt;&gt; Brian just would be really proud of us. Everybody's wearing umbrellas here. That's true. &gt;&gt; Your parents come back from Norway &gt;&gt; and they're like, "Why are Europeans all the way at midday standing under the on the grass under the strong sun?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hey, feel free to say hi. Hi. Heat. Heat. 1 hour 20. &gt;&gt; 1 hour 20. &gt;&gt; How many kilometers? I don't know cuz it's on my I think 16 or 17 maybe. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's do 50. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. First is my teacher. &gt;&gt; I think about a month ago I wanted to start to train to the gym. And he was like, "Oh, you know, like uh if you're looking for a PT or something, just I'll train you." And he refused any financial incentives or anything. Like he's been literally training me just for free. So that's how kind people are. And we're going to now head over a little session really quick. I'm dying. This is the end. This totally the end. Yeah. one. &gt;&gt; This is horrible. I hate this. We say goodbye to &gt;&gt; He killed He killed me every single time I struggle to walk. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I saw you did all the maximum weight in the machine. &gt;&gt; He's pushing me hard, but just enough. &gt;&gt; Okay, maybe we give a little backstory. So, 30 days ago, we we arrived in Korea and I wanted to get into the gym just to see how that goes. Yeah, because you before you didn't do any weightlifting, so you wanted to learn the perfect form to prevent injuries. &gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. And I did ch method. So I asked GPT and YouTube videos and I think in the first session he saw me like doing whatever you know, with the weight &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so he he doesn't speak English and I barely speak any Korean, but he started to coach me the first lesson and then he's like, I can actually coach you like twice a week or something. And then in the ended up like he coached me like almost 10 times. is super kind. It's like a free PT. It's amazing. I think it's a good example of Korean people &gt;&gt; like this act of kindness that they would we offered him to pay him for his time like the PT sessions, right? &gt;&gt; He keep denying and really beautiful kindness of Koreans. &gt;&gt; So maybe let's show the results. &gt;&gt; Oh, the weight, the body weight and stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So we did the inbody test to see how much muscles and body fat you want. Can you show me? 4.5 kilogram of fat. That's crazy. You are 5.6% of body fat. Are you a bodybuilder? &gt;&gt; It's crazy, man. Do you think it's really 5.6? &gt;&gt; I mean, your skin is very lean. It shows the body fat level. &gt;&gt; Ah, maybe the the reason it's very different from bodybuilders body &gt;&gt; is because I don't have much muscles. So, it doesn't &gt;&gt; Yeah. They they have way more volume. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. New Zealand 6 months ago, body fat was 11%. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. So that means like I reduce my body fat by half. &gt;&gt; Like if I want to really get muscly, &gt;&gt; I need to eat way more. &gt;&gt; More carbs. &gt;&gt; More carbs. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz so much protein texting liver. So it's not good. &gt;&gt; But at the same time, this kind of like cardio stuff, it's better when you're not kind of lean &gt;&gt; cuz you can run longer, faster. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Uh it's kind of a in between, you know. Actually, talking about V2 max, we have to do a test, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. That was our promise. Oh, let's get a V2 max test. &gt;&gt; I think if there is one biomarker to track is V2 max. &gt;&gt; It tells how much your muscles &gt;&gt; are able to use oxygen that you breathe when you're exosing. It's a good indicators of how fit healthy you are. &gt;&gt; And it's a good predictor of how well your your heart and the rest of your body is aging. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. What is your goal then? What is a good level? &gt;&gt; I think so. Okay. So, we are kind of following Brian Johnson's routine. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; So, our kind of reference point is Brian Johnson, which I think is a 55 elite athletes or around 70 in our age. If you're above 50, I think he's really good. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, I hope we have 50 plus both of us. &gt;&gt; Uh hopefully. &gt;&gt; Hopefully. &gt;&gt; So, not only you to test, we actually did the blood test in Korea. &gt;&gt; Yeah, true. And the funny thing is because I built also apps related to health that I was like wait I need to add a feature where I can upload my blood work tests &gt;&gt; into bio age. And so this is basically how it looks. The book good energy about all the important stuff to track in your health. Those are all the biomarkers the author say to track. And so basically the feature is like you upload your lab test a PDF whatever file and it's going to extract all those bio markers and put it in the little table here give you a glimpse of how good it is for you and then you can see one column equal one lab test and you can see over the month or years how you perform and the idea the big plan is that later on I connect blood work exercise data sleep data food data basically a sort of chachi PT but trained on my own health data &gt;&gt; hopefully Anderson also use it. &gt;&gt; I think he might be working on something similar. He's big into AI and he's definitely the person to go to for when it comes to longevity. So I'm pretty sure he has something planned. &gt;&gt; So on the blood test last year I had over 300 cholesterol level but this year I reduced by half. We're working so hard for our health. So let's see what is our score for the V2 max test. &gt;&gt; Before we do the V2 text max, I cannot not see this. I I cannot talk to you while chewing gum. It's very impolite. So I had to rest my gum on myself. &gt;&gt; And in 3 seconds, me in the most painful moment of my life. &gt;&gt; Very good. view to test. &gt;&gt; I think this is where we go. &gt;&gt; Close to your heart, like right below your chest. &gt;&gt; You know, it's harder than it looks. This was the worst. &gt;&gt; This is what the wor I feel dumb. Okay. Oh, actually it's like 100k all equipment cost. So if you cannot make it, just grab the bar and then keep running and he will decrease the incline and speed. So as soon as you grab the bar, then it's &gt;&gt; okay. Game over. &gt;&gt; Actually, I was thinking my mix. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; you're like a crazy king. Looks like a picture human. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's really you breathe in. Yes. &gt;&gt; Sh. &gt;&gt; Let's start it. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Now we're walking quite comfortable pace. Very rarely people make on to seven. So your goal is maybe seven. Oh, it's getting faster. 50 seconds before the stage four. working. &gt;&gt; Ah, good job. You did so well. &gt;&gt; Very good. Very good. &gt;&gt; How was it? &gt;&gt; So hard. &gt;&gt; Yeah. At the end, &gt;&gt; like my uh my brain was getting dizzy, like passing out. &gt;&gt; I think we're not used to climb &gt;&gt; like this. And it's just a killer. So hard. &gt;&gt; And also I don't know maybe cuz I have a massive nose but it presses here. So I end up breathing only with my mouth. &gt;&gt; Ah &gt;&gt; you couldn't breathe with the nose. &gt;&gt; Always the first thing is better to be low so you can see the improve it. &gt;&gt; Yay. Always find the positive side. &gt;&gt; Results in 3 2 1. &gt;&gt; We got the result. What is your view to mix? &gt;&gt; 57. &gt;&gt; Wow. That's so nice. your top three% of the male &gt;&gt; max economy. &gt;&gt; It's a estimated record of your current like a capability to mix and everything. So it looks very nice. &gt;&gt; I could make a marathon in less than 3 hours. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. This &gt;&gt; Wow, it changed. &gt;&gt; This is super interesting. &gt;&gt; We have a theory for this &gt;&gt; is because smartphones people look down so they don't cross the road when it's red. &gt;&gt; I mean, it makes so much sense though like when I see people they all look at their phone like or look at the floor &gt;&gt; and Korea must protect this citizen to compensate with &gt;&gt; population. So, we need to save one more young people. &gt;&gt; Yeah, true. By the way, we haven't done it yet. &gt;&gt; Our daily routine. &gt;&gt; The new daily routine. &gt;&gt; Are you going to check now? &gt;&gt; Should I? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Was it? How much is our MR now? &gt;&gt; Oh No. We were checking data first MR every day when we walk at the end of the day and we're like, "Oh, when do we get 5K?" Because this is very like &gt;&gt; where I spend the last 9 months of my life working on this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wow. Finally 5K man. &gt;&gt; Which means I have to run 5K. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. So Mark will run 5K, 6K, 7K whenever he reach those stage. So &gt;&gt; that's no good. I prefer the 5K MR than the 5K run. I think it's time to get the out of here until people think we're weird YouTubers. Finally, $5,000 monthly recurring revenue for Delafast. And I am so freaking happy. The reason is about 3 months ago, I think it was around May. I was wondering if things don't change, if it doesn't grow a little faster, that I might have to move on because I will just burn out. Cuz I literally spent a year working on Dataf Fast and I felt like it was really slow. The churn was high, the revenue was not growing crazy, but then luckily something happened. So I talked about that in my previous video how this little uh public map globe of uh visitors on site created a little sort of like network effect. It gave customers something to share on social media which get them attention and at the same time it would bring some people to datafast which would grow a little uh customer base. Then around 2 months ago, I started to redesign completely the onboarding for data fast cuz I realized lots of people actually just signed up but never created a website and so I changed the entire onboarding and I learned a lot of stuff. I'll drop a link to a little free article I wrote on my newsletter uh where you can dig into everything I learned. Uh on boarding is very important because that's how you get people from just being uh curious about your product to being interesting and having their attention. And then finally, I think because of the recent feature I shipped, which is especially this one, the funnel part where uh people can see like how people move from steps to step in their the journey for whatever they're trying to achieve. It helps people find bottlenecks and it position data fast not just as uh a nice to have analytics tool, but as a way to find bottlenecks inside of people's marketing funnel. For instance, one thing that I've learned uh this is datafast funnel uh on datafast and it's basically the scroll uh depth of datafast. So that's how far people scroll on my landing page on datafast landing page. And I just saw that uh around 60% of people never even scroll past the hero section. They land on the site and they just drop off right away. So this was a very like huge insight for me and I as well for some customers which I think is one of the reason why datafas grew and what I'm doing right now is because of this number exactly this number precisely this one I am a little frustrated uh so I'm trying to change the hero section of data fast I have a feeling I could write something much better here some people say it's generic so right now I'm focusing more on the marketing side and especially on the literally like the front page the landing page of data fast also I have been working on this very very long series of videos. I will only release that if I actually manage to grow data fast to a million dollar in valuation, which is around $25,000 in monthly recurring revenue. I'm extremely far from being there. But if it happens, if I ever reach my goal, uh I will have all those uh videos uh that I can share that I literally go from whatever kinds of emotion from day I think day one, day two, whatever until uh what whatever date it is now, I think day 331. So that would make an interesting video and I will only get there if I ship a lot of stuff. So now it's time to get back to coding.
