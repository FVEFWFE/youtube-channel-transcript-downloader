================================================================================

drums keep pounding a rym to the brain something big happened in August because of that burn out no it's way too cliche August has been a crazy month so let's start with the finances so this is what my portfolio of tiny startup earned in the last 30 days the the entire business is up 2% compared to July and it was the biggest month for one of my software in the page I launched the software a year and a half ago and the revenue well the revenue is has been doing something like this it's a little bit uneven but it's roughly going up and it's ranging between $1,000 to $3,000 a month as you can see there's like this Spike that happened last week because I launched a new feature and I learned something that I ignored for so long if you had to guess which of those two tweets made the most [Music] money in both of them I promote Indie page and both of them got around 300 likes and uh one this one is more detailed there's like a 40 seconds Lun video of me explaining the product I spent some time carefully crafting the copy and there's like this one where is just a screenshots and a link to my software and um this one made $100 in 24 hours this one made $1,000 in 24 hours here I'm promoting a new feature in the software where people can verify their revenue with lemon squeezy it's a nice to have feature it's cool but it's not necessary and here I'm saying that you get a nice backlink which helps you rank higher on Google I only track one data for all of my startups if I get 100 visitors and it makes $100 then it's a $1 Revenue per visitor this vitamin gets 0.0 8 per visitor this painkiller gets $0.45 per visitor six time more Revenue it's much easier to sell a painkiller and the fun thing both are the same product I'm just talking about different features here so even vitamins products can be turned into a painkiller for instance a habit tracker is a nice thing to have it's cool to track your habit but it's not a painkiller now if the copy is framed around the fact that if you don't track your habits then you're going to not stick to your workout routine and you're not going to lose weight or you're not going to get in shape this becomes a painkiller so by finding the right feature or the right angle in your product that is an actual painkiller and remaking your website copy your Ling page copy around the problem it's solving then you can increase your commer rate with minimal effort and it took me one year and a half to realize that and uh and overall the revenue Bas line is always a little higher each month which is a good thing and um if you watch my previous video talking about how I find free tool free marketing tools to promote my business then you probably remember this little uh Indie page bot I created and um it it's 1.5 th000 followers now it keeps growing every day and it gets more likes more impression and I feel like this is one of the reason people are discovering the app more and more and uh something big happened in August I finally made $1 million on the internet after 7 years of grinding and failing 27 projects out of those 27 projects 10 of them made money so it was pretty hard for me to try to know exactly how much I've earned since I started so I bought this little display here and I created an app that is fetching all the revenue from my 10 stripe account and every hour it's updating the total revenue I earned since I started the journey and it's even crazier to think that 80% of that amount was made in the last 360 5 days I'll make an entire video of every failures I've been through and what I've learned from it there's stuff like this where like I would spend a year in my bedroom overthinking a startup but by not quitting I ended up winning and that makes me so so happy and proud of myself and um I don't I don't like to own stuff so I don't buy anything except except when I broke those those boards here but this month I've made a little exception my sister was visiting me in B so we went to nanida a little island nearby B which is smaller quieter calmer and super beautiful and we booked an amazing Villa for a $600 a night which is a ridiculous amount of money to spend in belly but it was totally worth it the Villa was wonderful we had a good time there we went snorkling we saw the Mena raay if you come to Bal this is an amazing experience to do and my good Twitter friends also visited us so it was absolutely wonderful okay and yesterday someone try to screw my website but I was prepared let me show you so I built this tool here it's called bu disput it aims at reducing charge back disputes on stripe and this is for instance my dashboard with all of my startups those are the rules I set up if I receive a payment with a suspicious email I would like to receive an email and if a card is reported stolen or lost I would like to refund the last payment and yesterday I received four emails and in my alerts I could see that um four credit cards were reported stolen and by dispute refunded all those payments so I went on strip to check what was going on and those are the refunded payments and I see I have weird customers with weird names either because they're like I don't know too simple or the the the place where the payment was made does not match so I took the emails and I checked in my database and um and nothing really matches the person is called Scots the email address is something that have nothing to do with Scots it's a do ID like IND Thea all those customers look suspicious and I'm so happy my little software was here to code that because because I could have ended up with four disputes and the fact that everything happened within a two hours window it made me think that someone was trying to screw my startups but I'm getting used to it now and I absolutely love this startup uh but the problem is not making lots of money I think it's making a couple hundred per month which is absolutely not crazy and the problem is that I don't really talk about it because it's like an insurance company I have to remind people that there is a danger with your STP account it could be banned from one day to another this actually happened to me and the thing is I need to spread fear to market the startup and I I just don't like that so I don't do it a lot but I'm just happy it's serving me and a few other customers and it's pretty helpful so far I'm recording this video on September 1st and today is a little special day one year ago I made this video all right so what do we have Here solo preneur 27 years old because of death burn out spend 3 days sending up gns record and E emails ended up in the span folder anyway well that wouldn't have happened if he had used the ship as boiler plates I launched this little startup a year ago and this has totally changed my life so um a little little celebration today happy birthday she remember this guy we talked about him in one of my previous videos [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I love you too man and all you have to do is this habit tracker for developers this is is generous and this is also a good example of what the solo prer Journey looks like a tiny idea in mind ship it fast show it to some people see what they think about it improve the product with their feedback make a little bit of money grow a little following on Twitter Youtube whatever and keep shipping so that the journey becomes easier and easier thank you Max it's a beautiful product and keep showing us how things should be done and if you're interested in getting desk Hub I'll add a link below I am not an affiliate just a fan all right and um final thing for this month I bought this thing a big big massive uh book I'm reading it biography I normally read on a Kindle uh but I feel good sometimes having a little paper in my hand especially at night when I'm about to go to bed I don't want to have any screen and it feels good to touch paper and it's good to read big entrepreneurs biography uh you can see Ambitions were like all up there and me with my tiny projects I'm I'm way down there but it makes me feel good somehow that there's a new form of Entrepreneurship where less ambition more freedom simple life little bit of surf a little bit of daily life with a wife prioritize my sleep Etc um I like that a lot as well and uh finally I was looking for a new format for this Vlog to try to show you everything I do in a month as a solo entrepreneur I tried to chat with AI this morning um I'm making a video for YouTube for a title you might consider something like are you here are you there or am I talking I'm here oh it's way too cliche and eventually showcase the how about these title options no I understand I was trying to know if CH GPT would come up with a good idea for those videos but um it's a little bit cliche and it was nothing really good but the conversation itself with the AI was amazing it felt very natural like I could literally see myself dating an AI talking about life questioning it was really pleasurable so for now I'm going to stick to a monthly recap that is more settle more calm I'm here at my office sharing you insight about everything that happens in my tiny businesses actually I wish I would share more but I have been building something almost secret for the past 3 month and I am launching next month so I'll have way more to share and I'll be here at my desk but somehow it's a little shame if I don't show you some parts of belly because it is absolutely beautiful so I've got to bring you with me for this fin part watch this gu why W you give me why you give me that was so beautiful
