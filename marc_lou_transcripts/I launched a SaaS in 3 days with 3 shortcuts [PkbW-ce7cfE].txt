================================================================================

in 2017 I spent one year building an app that got zero users two weeks ago I had a random startup ID in mind and it took me only 3 days to build the product using Ai and 24 hours later the launch I made $1,000 Us in profit in this video I'm going to show you the software how I got the startup ID and especially how I use artificial intelligence in order to build really fast let's go all right let me show you real quick what the product is it's called poop up it's the Ling page that you can see here and it basically it's a little script for website that will display popup notifications like those ones customers would typically use it to show that they know the pain of their own customers in order to improve their website conversion rate so this is the landing page that I built right here as you can see we got a couple things going on in here and when customers are ready they can click here they will be prompt to pay and once they've paid they go to their customer dashboard I'm going to show you that right now right there they can add websites let's say we're going to go to that website right here and here is where they customize the pop-ups they want to send they can add messages where each message could have text you could have some icons and everything people can reorganize it and once they're ready they will get a little script at the bottom right here and once it's installed on their own website they can test it and you can see on the right side we going to see those notifications coming up I have built over 20 side projects and one of the most common question that I get is how do you find startup IDs and the answer is simple I do not search for IDs they come to me these product poop up came after I launched Zenvo a little tool for stripe users to to generate invoices without paying the fee I added popup notification on the site to nudge customers into buying and people say we love the notification and poop up came up and prior to Zenvo I was playing around with ship fast a boiler plate for nexs developers and I found out that I paid a lot of money for stripe invoices and I decided to turn those off and I realized I needed to have some kind of product that would let me generate invoices for free and that's how I came up with Zenvo and we can go back in time and the loop keeps going on I build Chast because of another product because of another product and another product so the answer to finding startup IDs is to start somewhere anywhere you can build a note note taking app just make a better version or a version that you would use and you're going to stumble upon real problems in your workflow you're going to learn stuff you can build a tiny audience there will be things happening and those are promising idas for the future I built the product poop up in 3 days and I'm going to share the three ways I actually use in order to build fast and first is that I use a code boiler plate it's called cheap fast it's a boiler plate I made for myself it includes a bunch of learing page comp components so I just have to fill the copy and the landing page is ready it includes also some cool features like user login private dashboard with just a click of a button it handles all the stripe web hook events so I have users updated in my database as soon as they pay and so the actual final part that was missing was to create the script that would sit on my customer's website in order to display those popup notification and this is where AI comes in very handy and I will share everything that I do with GitHub co-pilot in order to build sometimes code that I don't even understand I use GI up cop highight in order to write code two to three times faster it's basically chpt inside of your code editor I can write code fix your code explain your code but you can also do a bunch of other stuff like generate a nice color palette or sometimes even write your copy for the landing page it's absolutely awesome and let me show you how it looks I use copilot absolutely everywhere to write most of my code and I can use it for very simple tasks to very Advanced and integrated tasks let me show you how that works so basically you would write plain English let's say I want to have an array of all the days of the week with all the days of the week you press enter and bingo I press Tab and then is going to create the JavaScript array with all the days of the week which is very handy if I want to do something a bit more advanced I can keep typing English and it knows the entire code of this file and so he going to be able to interact with it let's say now I am on the product when we press test we're going to fire some popup notifications at the top right what we want to do is if the person change to a different page we want to remove those popups and so we need to have some kind of cleanup function and I am familiar with reactjs but JavaScript a little less so I can just tell copilot like if a route change user navigates away call cleanup I press enter and boom I press Tab and GitHub copilot generated this little event listener and we call the cleanup function which is right there that was actually created by copilot and it's going to remove all the pop-ups that we've had it's also really good at generating copy for your websites so not only code but like actually plain English like copyrighting so here on this page I removed this is the headline of the page I remove the text that was right underneath on purpose and if we go to the hero file we are going to see so we have the H1 here and this P tag here is the text that's underneath and bingo you see copilot already has a knowledge of what the product is about thanks to everything that I've uh written previously and it knows that this P tag is underneath the H1 so it should be some kind of like helper sub headline thing and it says oh poop up is a NOCO tool that helps your increase Visitors convers by chowing a poop up to your visitors it's not perfect you can fine tune it there a bunch of way to make the results better but it's really a good start for the copy and you can even use copilot in order to do some very cool stuff like play around with multiple files in your project so in this poop up example I have an API endpoint where I would basically get the script and get the data for the script to show which messages we have to display and I can say something like a functions that fetches the data from the endpoint and return it and here we go you see that we have an entire function um I'm going to come in that we have an entire function right here that is going to hit my API endpoint it's going to pass some parameters and I'm going to get the data back and it's going to sanitize the data and return it and it knows exactly how to write the function for my own code because if I go to that API endpoint so the script in the API part here it knows which parameters are needed the body which part of the body we need the domain and then is going to pass on the right parameters based on what this API endpoint needs and it knows which data will be returned from the response by default GitHub copilot is very awesome but to make it even better you want to use those little tips first you want to provide context to copilot so by default when you type English copilot is going to create some code for you but you want the code to be usable right away so it means it has to hit the right API endpoint it has to have the right variable names in order to upload your new documents to the database right away and the only thing you have to do for that is to keep tabs open as you can see here at the top I have a bunch of tabs open and especially here I'm going to create a react component that lets users proceed to a stripe checkout and on the right side I open this file here which is an API endpoint that basically take on a few parameters create a strap trick out session and return the URL if I did not open this file copilot doesn't have access to it and so when I'm going to create my react component right here it will Generate random API endpoints and you will not name the variables as you do in your code so you want to keep all your files open and when you do this when you start creating your own react component in this case it's going to use all the files it knows from the project in order to create the right components so here we're going to say constant button bu you see as you can see here the price ID here is likely to be what we're going to have somewhere here in the API so it knows it's going to be calling this function so it knows it needs to be pass this variable and if I keep pressing tab enter it's going to Bingo it creates the entire components right here with a loading state with the call to the API it handles it knows when it's loading when it's not it's going to disable if it's not loading handle the click handle event and it's going to call the right API end point with the right parameters right here and this is achieved because it knows this file and this file knows how this file is working this is my database model it knows how users are restores in the database which Fields do they have by default copilot already knows the packages you've installed as you can see here it called those two packages at the top so you don't need to do anything for that another part that very helpful in order to get the most out of copilot is to have your own boiler plates which means a code base that you reuse across different projects where you name variables the same way you have the same way of naming your database schemas and all that so that you already provide the foundation to co-pilot so it knows already how are you going to name this API endpoint how you're going to name a new users uh fields in the database and all that and the final part to leverage GitHub copilot is to use very tiny functions that you can reuse everywhere in your code so in this API route we can see here we have a function that creates the checkout and if you go here we open the stripe.js file which has a few helper function function for stripe such as a function to create a checkout or create a customer portal those are very tiny function that have a specific use case and this is useful because anytime I create a new API routes for instance copilot will be able to reuse those functions in order to do a specific actions and finally in order to ship this app in 3 days I use a bunch of unconventional methods such as not using typescript not using G branches not testing my code I will share somewhere around here a link to that video if you want to dive into it more and so after spending three days on the product it was actually done and I launched it everywhere from producton Twitter hicker news and reddits in total I think there was about 7,000 visitors on the site it made $1,000 within the first 24 hours and I think it's been 4 days now and it should cross $2,000 pretty soon which is pretty good for a tiny product like this one that's it I hope you enjoy the video and you realize the power of AI how a little guy like me can have a junior engineer and a copywriter and maybe even a secretary assistant thanks to AI if you want to dive deeper into how I get couple thousand visitors and the first customers on all my products I'll link to another video somewhere where I go more into details into that if you like the video you can like the video and if you loved it you can subscribe to the channel until then I'll see you for the next video and I hope you just ship it cheers
