================================================================================

what I what I there there are three things I like in this world right it's time to get out of here I made $667 in July 20124 and I was on holiday for 2 weeks in this longer format Vlog I'm sharing everything I did in July as a solo entrepreneur who is not ambitious and build 24 tiny startups but first I I need to holidays are great but I need to go back to the office in case it wasn't obvious that I'm French Fu don't [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] now look what I'm stuck with don't care if I'm in the room on July 3rd I did a podcast with stter story it's a big YouTube channel that tells successful entrepreneurs stories and how they got started the founder Pat walls is awesome we had a great time and if the interview is available I'll add the link in the description and it's crazy to think that two years ago I was a random guy in my room well I I still I still am but now I end up on like those podcast where I get a chance to tell my story those same podcast that I used to listen to get inspired and get motivated and all it took was building the right startup and since startup story is based in the US and I live in valy they send someone like a professional with videography guy who came to my house to show that interview and uh and that guy become the person who is editing those videos hey y I'm out here on the road you can hear little voice still get look the money speaking for itself I call it Fortune ta five top from a that work at corporate sales chinchilla youan we skiing out in Cor chel break the news they try to kill him but the boy prevails everybody's sleeping out there and uh I found my little office uh joke aside the entire EV crew is so friendly they just set up the entire space for me and everybody was so up to it all right so in November 2022 I built gamify list it's a little directory of gamified apps it has around 600 apps that help people achieve their goals using gamification and I built it just because first it's fun and second because I also owned a habit tracker that's gamified and I wanted to build like some kind of like side project to promote my habit tracker and the directory of gamification apps is the perfect place to do that but it appear there's some turbulences it's a it's a moving shaking office back then I had zero clue about SE and Google started to index and rank some of those pages and fast forward to today there is a constant growth in terms of impression and clicks and it brings around 100 clicks per day and somewhere in July I saw this app called Pokémon sleep it's making 100 million in profit per year it's and it's just an app that lets you grow Pokémons if you sleep well and I love the app that's why I added it to my repository this month if you've been watching my previous videos I'm looking for some kind of software where I can spend my entire day adding features and I hope to bring that software to a million dooll valuation I already have the idea in mind and I cannot reveal exactly what it's going to do cuz I get a bunch of copycats but I already have an idea in mind that I've already started building and earlier this month I run a design bounty on Twitter because I was struggling with uh a specific part of the UI for that application a design Bounty it's basically an open contest where uh every designer can submit their creation and the winner receiv some kind of financial reward was the first time for me to do that on Twitter and um I found a design that I really liked so now I'm just coding that software and I think I should be able to launch a first version by the end of the next month one of the biggest struggle and the biggest shift for July was uh my YouTube channel if you've watched some others of my videos you'll see that in July I've made a big change in terms of how I tell the stories I'm not sitting at my desk anymore I'm traveling I'm doing some workouts I'm wrapping those business encoding stories around like lifestyle stories just like this Vlog and um I'm having three times more fun shooting those videos and YouTube is giving three times less impression it's not that I'm doing those for the numbers but it's somehow what keeps me motivated to make those videos and at the same time i' like to have an impact so if you think is pushing my videos to more people then that just makes me happy and so I'm trying to find a good mix of what's valuable and what's fun my channel went from 5,000 to somewhere around 70,000 subscriber in the span of like 2 to 3 month and it was mostly because of three videos how many website I made my text Tack and how fast I launched assess these are great videos I enjoyed doing them but the problem is that I cannot replicate that all the time so I can milk the entire story over and over but you deserve much better than that and it's kind of boring to be honest that's why I'm trying to round those business story inside of a lifestyle Vlog so it's kind of fun new and different but YouTube is a mirror of what people think and since it's not giving much impression I also kind of assume that it's a little bit boring and this is pretty much where I am stuck at the moment I don't know if I should follow the number and keep doing the same videos that worked well on my channel so far or if I should just follow my instinct have fun and make more of those videos and I also shipped a new feature for my software called Indie page it's a Linkin bio for entrepreneurs customers can add their startups and connect with their payment provider so that they get a public page with a verified revenue and a few months ago I added a little board where those startups are ranked based on on the revenue in the last 30 days and I wanted to go a little further so I created a Twitter bot that every week shares the leaderboard for the past 7even days it also tag the person and on top of that it tweets three times per day when a maker is receiving a payment so if you want your daily dose of motivation I would add a link of the Twitter bot in the description it's the craziest setup I've ever I've ever done I think [Music] 2 hours transit in Tye there are three things I like in this world building startups surfing and skating in the airport my penny board not to loaded okay got toas I'm baby Chas too [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] me so all right let's talk about Revenue all right so this is the revenue breakdown for all of my tiny project for the month of of July 2024 and the revenue is down around 24% compared to June 2024 and it was kind of expected because I was off on a holiday for 2 weeks I was actually a little surprised he didn't drop more than that because I was well I was completely off for half of the month which shows that I probably don't understand much in business yet talking about holidays oh the bur paining to you heart this is my little YouTube Studio for the next couple of second because my front neighbor think I'm doing something illegal by whispering to this microphone all right so talking about holidays I went back to my hometown in France for 3 weeks I usually never take time off because I love building stuff but that make a little exception for Summertime with my entire family we went to the south of France and we did some surfing cycling and hiking and this is usually how I get good startups IDE when my brand is rested that's exactly how I came up with my startup that's bringing the most Revenue then I went back to Paris I didn't see the Olympics but it was a fun exotic Vibe because all the Parisian were gone and only tourists were in Paris all right it's time to get out of here before the cabin crew opens the door ran little home just Landing in bing all right the final updates for this month is that they added a tiny feature to Zenvo it's a tour to over customers to pay the 4% fee to generate stripe invoices and as I'm getting more customers I'm also getting more feedback and one of them was to add the name of the vat next to the rate of the vat for instance in France we have to add vat next to the percentage the more customers I gets the more I realize that the entire invoicing system is very complex especially in Europe where each country has specifications and if I want to make this invoices compliant in most countries I need to cover lots of use cases and my my code is starting to look very um well I I had to recreate my entire invoicing object based on where I get the data from stripe whether it's a checkout or whether it's payment intent there are so many use cases that I'm I'm getting around a thousand lines of code just to create an invoice financially wise it does not make sense for me to invest my time on this startup but I still do it because a that's how I save money on the stri fees because I use my own products two because I'm also learning a lot about the entire invoicing system which is pretty complex and interesting and three because maybe by getting customer feedback I'll land on some kind of a new feature or a new product that can be an entire startup that makes way more money I am a big fan of Brian Johnson the the vampire guy I uh I invested a little bit of my profit into health I like Brian I like his Spite and I like how ComEd he is he's using his own product and it kind of remind me of what I do with with my own little startups on a much much smaller scale though and now that I'm back in belly I I really need to do that back to the office
