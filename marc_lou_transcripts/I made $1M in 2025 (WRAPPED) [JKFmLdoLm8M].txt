================================================================================

I made over $1 million in 2025 from those 15 sources of income. And even though it's about 20% less than last year, I wouldn't change a thing because this was my most peaceful year ever. And also, this is the most diversified my portfolio has gotten. So, those two products right here are the one generating twothird of the revenue. Those are Codefast, which I launched last year and is making around $20,000 a month at the moment. And the other one is Ship Pass, my codebase for developer, which I launched over 2.5 years ago and is also making $20,000 a month at the moment. The next one in orange is DataFast, which is the one I'm the most proud of. It's a web analytics software. It tells me for all of my project how many visitors and how much revenue it has generated. I spent over 200 days uh building features for this product and sharing everything on Twitter. And that eventually paid off. Currently, the SAS is at 15 close to $16,000 in monthly recurring revenue and the annual recurring revenue is around $200,000 which with a multiple of four uh this would make an around $800,000 assets. I would of course never sell it, but just that makes me uh proud that I was able to build this thing and it's also my favorite product to work on because I never have to do any marketing. My users are actually doing marketing for me. They share a screenshot of their dashboard and then when people are curious um sometimes they mention that they're using datafast and that brings organic traffic to the product. All I have to do is to build a screenshot worthy features that my users hopefully are going to share on social media. To be honest, I don't really know what is next for data fast. Uh what I do is I just listen to feedback from power users and build the features. I also recently built this like a new little feature where I can see what people share on social media and when I when I see people mentioning features I just um if if many of them mention that I will just build a feature and hopefully that will grow the product. The next source of income and the most unexpected is the one in blue here which is around $50,000 uh uh which I launched two months ago in November 2025. This was initially this little website here uh where it's like a big database of uh startups. Each startup has a page where we can see the revenue over the last days, years, etc. Within a couple of days, this product went from zero uh just an idea to something making around 20 to $25,000 in monthly recurring revenue. This was a crazy journey. And if you're curious, there's a little video on my channel where um I share more about the initial launch. After the initial craze of the launch, I wanted to hopefully make this project sustain and maintain for long term. So I started to build vertical like a bunch of different alternatives like verticals of this initial project. So I made this game and a bunch of other verticals and most failed but one of them uh this one ended up working really well. This is a marketplace built on top of the database. So anyone can list a startup. uh those are the actual revenue from Stripe. Those revenue are verified which builds trust and the people who are interested in buying startups can just go here contact the seller and they enter a place where they can chat with the seller and hopefully they get acquired within the first 3 weeks of launching this feature. Uh there were bunch of new startup listing on sale and it keeps growing more and more every day and also about a dozen of startups have already been acquired. That makes me extremely happy and this is where I'm spending most of my time at the moment. Uh currently what people can do is they can uh they have a private dashboard where they can uh chat with uh people with buyers and sellers and the next step is to add a system where it creates all the legal documents. It put them in the escrow account and then the seller and the buyer can exchange assets safely. Another new source of income for me was stock markets. I made $140,000 this year from the stock market. Uh this is my portfolio or screenshot of my portfolio. I'm not a big fan of investing but I know that if I keep my money in the bank uh it will just be eaten by inflation. So I started investing in the uh S&amp;P 500. I think it's the most safest assets which has a good return on investment. So I started to dollar cost average on the S&amp;P 500. I started at $5,000 per week and I increased that to around $15,000 per week. I think right now I have close to a million dollar invested in the S&amp;P 500. And recently I started investing $5,000 per week in CHN which is basically the equivalent of the S&amp;P 500 but for Chinese tech company. Uh besides TrustMr I failed three new startups this year. Bio age which is an app that I use my wife and I use every day but for some reason it couldn't find any product market fit. Um I also failed this one which is a little clipping campaign. And the rest of my revenue is coming from this little software right here, which all combined, they made around $20,000 this year. They serve a specific purpose. I automated everything so that it doesn't take any time from me. And now a little note on the health side of things because I realized that the healthier I am, the more I take care of myself, the better I am at uh building startups. And so I recently reach minus 18 years old biological age with my wearable. It's telling me that I am 14 years younger than I currently am. It sounds a little bit cliche, but uh it's looking at a bunch of metrics in order to get this number. And it's actually pretty hard. It looks at the daily step counts over the last uh 6 months. Some metrics like V2 max, resting heart rate, how much you sleep, what is your sleep consistency, the time you spend in strength training, different heart rate zone, etc. One of the big games changer for me this year was that I started going to the gym and as a result, I gained 4 kilos of muscles. I never went to the gym before because I thought it would take too much of my time. But I also realized that it's much easier to go to the gym if you don't have motivation because you know there will be some people you've paid for the class, you've committed ahead and so that makes fitness a little easier for me. I also tested my V2 max for the first time this year. It's basically a test where you put they push you a rupture to see what is your lactates threshold. This is a really good indicator of your overall uh health and longevity markers. Uh my score was 57 something uh milliliters per minute per kilogram which puts me in the top 500 of males of my age. If you have ever done the test or if you intend to do it, it is just absolutely horrible because you literally have to run until you literally pass out. And final note on the health side, um as last year I also drunk zero liter of alcohol. I try to get at least 10k daily steps which made I think this year 4.2 million steps in 2025. And I eat I ate or I still eat 90% of clean food. And on the more personal side, my wife and I started to travel the world. We visited seven new countries this year. We've been to New Zealand, South Africa, Greece, where I am at the moment, India, South Korea, France. We've been a little bit everywhere because we're looking for a new place to leave after Bali. Another reason we started to travel is to meet you all, the ones uh behind the camera. Uh we started organizing meetups across each location we've been. Uh this was in India, this was in Korea, this was the first one in France. The goal with those meetups is to just gather a bunch of indie hackers. Uh we talk, we chat, it's super easy peasy and friendly. People make friends and sometimes they become co-ounders. Those meetups are really amazing and it warms my heart. And finally, those are my three favorite books I read this year. Uh I try to read 15 minutes a day either with my morning coffee or before I go to bed or both. And those are the ones I like the most. That's it for 2025. I hope 2026 unfold exactly like 2025 did. I'm on the same discipline. I want the same work life balance. I just hope that I can build more startups because I've been a bit slacking last year shipping only four side project. And now it's time to wish you a happy new year and all the best for 2026. I hope you crush all your side project and everything you dream of and I will see you in the next video. Cheers.
