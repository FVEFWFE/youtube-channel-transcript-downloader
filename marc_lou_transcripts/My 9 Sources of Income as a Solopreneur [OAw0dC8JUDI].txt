================================================================================

hey it's Mark in the last 3 years I taught myself how to code managed to get a software engineer job and get fired and I also built 20 websites that are now making $50,000 a month at 90% profit and zero employee I'm going to break down all those sites but before I'm going to share uh how I ended up in this journey in 2021 I was living at my parents house and I was a bit bored so I Tau myself how to code using UD me and uh YouTube videos uh this is me learning how to program at my parents place um within a few months I started to apply on Angel list which is now I guess well found and I miraculously found a job as a junior software engineer and within 5 months they fired me CU they realized I was a really mediocre programmer but thanks to the job I realized that I actually love programming because it kind of reminded me of Lego which I used to uh be crazy about when I was a kid where I could build stuff and with programming you can show it to people and it can be of use of other people so back then uh it was the end of 2021 I moved to Bali and I decided to work on projects of my own build my own websites my first website was uh this little thing where uh you can find movies that are related to your mood if you're in a romantic mood maybe you want to watch some uh whatever movies um and I get I get to love the process of like building and launching those websites um I would go on product Huns and share my uh website there it would uh get a little bit of attention I will also share it on Twitter uh with other people doing similar things where I also get to me a lot of friends uh I studed Twitter in 2022 with zero followers and the fact that I was sharing what I was doing um I managed to build a little audience there and made a lot of friends and when I realized I could actually also make a living by building website I studed to focus on other tools like AI tools like this one where uh you can make an entire landing page uh than thanks to AI um I built softwares I bu I built productivity tools uh anything think that I could add a pricing on so I could pay my bills and fast forward to 2024 um my Revenue in the last 30 days is almost $60,000 and I am a solo entrepreneur I built about 20 websites most of them never made money uh a lot of them may make just very like very little money and one of them is uh paying the bill much more than I need so I'm going to break down the revenue for all those this is making uh less than $100 month it's a uh AI tool that will create workbooks uh so you can practice a new language based on topics that you like so if you like uh K-pop you can learn Korean with K-pop topics it will craft the workbook just for you um I also built a software called viral libot I used to work with escape room businesses uh to help them get more uh customers they would get a messenger bot which is what I called a viral bot um this is it on messenger it's a an automated conversation with uh it's not even an AI it's just a basic um you know just a basic replies but you can play games as a player and you can say oh I want to play this game and the bot will reply to you with uh some riddles and if you solve the puzzle you can get a discount coupon for the escap room businesses I work with and that would get them more business and I would charge a monthly subscription for that I also built a buy dispute it's making uh I would say less than $1,000 a month which is a tool a no code tool for developers like me who work with uh with tripe uh to avoid getting dispute chargeback like Angry customers that would uh make yourself get banned from the platform uh it connects to the plat to your strap accounts and you can add rules uh where you say oh if this then that and if something suspicious happen then prevents the action uh I also built something called Indie page is kind of like a link tree for entrepreneurs where you can showcase your startups and you can connect with your your payment provider so it shows your revenue and it links to all your startups it's making um actually this is built using Indie page uh it's making 1.2k in the last 30 days um I also created a course recently uh because some of the video some of the product that I would launch on Twitter and product hunt uh I would use videos like this one where I would embed myself with a personality either in a movie or someone that's famous uh to help the launch uh to get some awareness during the launch and this made uh about $6,000 in the last 30 days and finally uh my biggest product is ship fast it's a code template um that you can use to ship startups faster I used to so because I made 20 website I realized I was doing the same thing over and over uh which is like sending up a database uh sending emails to the customers processing payments handling the subscriptions and so I package all that into a bottle plate and this is making um about $50,000 $50,000 a month and finally uh this is not a website but I got paid by Twitter uh this is recent um it's paying something between $150 a month to sometimes $400 a month uh which is pretty cool because I love Twitter so being paid for something a love it's it's super nice um and yeah um I didn't count this but I also sold three startups last year on this platform acquire. comom uh it's a place where you can buy and sell mro startup like a product like a habit tracker for instance uh I sold one for $10,000 uh this is this allows people like me who have no ambitious to um build a unicorn or go crazy and raise VC and have a lot of employees it allows people like like me um just you know make a living and and get into the startup world without uh going super big and finally I have a new later uh that's called just ship it that is about to reach 10,000 subscribers it's not monetized and I have no intent to monetize it U but I keep sharing my learnings in there and if you want to join it I'll add the link below I'm taking YouTube seriously this year and I'm going to share everything that I do and learn about this entire um entrepreneurship for developers Journey uh so if there's any questions or anything that's helpful please let me know that would help me craft better videos cheers
