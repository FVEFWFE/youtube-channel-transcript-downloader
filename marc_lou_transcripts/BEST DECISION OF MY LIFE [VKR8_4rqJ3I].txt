================================================================================

my wife is still sleeping it's almost 5 a.m. but I cannot sleep because today is a big day but let's talk about that later let's go to the beach first hey you don't watch that watch this time to [Music] Surf I love B the wings are so so good I have to work out every day but since the waves are so good I never have to go to the gy oh my God two boards two weeks at this point I might have to get a real job soon all right so this is yesterday night and that is today 100,000 followers on Twitter this is insane in this video I want to explain why it was the best decision of my of my life to uh try to build a little audience on the internet and how it change everything this is me thinking that I am the next Mark zenberu dollar ID and after one year it failed completely zero users zero doar of Revenue generation I failed multiple project and I always run into the two same issues first one is that I couldn't get anyone to use my app see if that spent month working on something and that nobody even cares what's the point I didn't have money to run ads and I don't even know how to run ads anyway I didn't want to raise money from VC because I want to work solo with my computer and second I felt so lonely no one in my family is an entrepreneur no one in my friends back then was an entrepreneur so I started with zero knowledge I didn't learn anything from anyone I didn't know anyone I could ask proper questions and so in 2021 I burned out after failing for so many years I was so angry at myself for being a failure that I punched the walls in my room and I decided to quit entrepreneurship and get a job as a software engineer while I was working for a guy that you probably know Ty Lopez knowledge who was not working from his garage anymore back then I discovered cryptocurrencies and I had to go on Twitter to retweet some stuff about nft and for the first time in my life I opened the application Twitter and I was like what if you know I'm just curious and I go over the news feed and I remember seeing a tweet from someone that changed my life I don't know who wrote that tweet but it was something along those lines I am a developer I work solo I travel the world and I make this amount of money I got fired a few months later but it did not matter because this tweet changed my mind and it made me want to go for this new generation of entrepreneurs so I restarted the journey with a totally different mindset I will share everything I built publicly on Twitter and I will try to connect with other entrepreneurs I showed up every single day and 8 months later nothing happened I was writing every day about the things that I was building or the things I was learning but no one really cared it was one two sometimes three likes and most of the time it was actually mine but it didn't matter because in those eight month I made a couple of friends five to 10 people who were doing the same thing as me and I know over the shoulders they were looking at what I was doing and that was just enough to keep me motivated because I couldn't just bust nothing so I had a reason to wake up and work on something that I would share with them it took 8 month to get 1,000 followers and then it took another 8 month to go from 1,000 to 10,000 and and finally took a year to go from 10,000 to 100,000 but it didn't matter because I was not focusing on numbers instead I was focusing on building cool stuff I was learning a lot building my own little portfolio and refining my signature until one day everything clicked so now I build a relationship with my audience they trust me with their attention so I'm pretty guaranteed that whenever I launch a new product I'll get a couple thousands of visitors so I never have to start again from zero at the beginning I would have to work this much to get these results and now with an audience it's the exact opposite and on top of that I got connected with amazing people people that I I never thought would ever talk to me I got the guy the podcast my first million that I watch every week in my DMs and Noah Kagan I did a podcast with him the CEO of absum $100 million a year and he's here wanted to make a podcast with me that's just crazy and if there is one thing I regret is to not have started earlier okay enough of me bragging now let me show you some guys who are doing it right and I think are going to explode soon okay first we have Anthony re Anthony reer anony he is a software developer and he's making the software to help uh Freelancers charge monthly subscriptions for the services the software is a beast very a bunch of really cool features and he's changing the life of its users and at the same time he's documenting his entire journey through very beautiful and well tell stories and at the same time he has a great sense of humor and then we have Max blade this guy is building a habit tracker for developers when you make a commit then he will show this on your habit tracker and he's documenting this entire Journey where it's stuff that we don't see normally like Hardware stuff it's very interesting and he is making really nice videos to share his entire Journey a which team grow from almost zero followers to what it is now in just a couple of week and this is amazing so give those two guys a follow there is just so much to learn from them see you at 1 million I broke a board this morning and the wavs are so good that I climb all the way up there those 350 stairs rush back home pick up this bigger board and came out again for those beautiful ways now that I'm about to upload this video I realized that it's been one year and one day I got married to this person and this might have been the best decision of my life
