================================================================================

Hey, get the camera rolling. Okay. Rejecting $1 million in cash, building a mobile app in 24 hours with AI, reaching 85% of my million-doll SAS goal, our new life in Greece, and a bunch of other things. Let's get this video rolling. &gt;&gt; Mark just turned down $1 million deal on MR here in Greece. &gt;&gt; Hopefully, we find the home here. In 4 weeks, there was 1,000 startups listed for sale. That is crazy. I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] proud of myself. &gt;&gt; Less than a day of work. No idea how to build iOS and Android apps. 3K to do until you were a child making. &gt;&gt; Is it time I tell you I don't have a gift yet? Wow. &gt;&gt; No time to think of consequences. Show yourself. only a family of trees to be haunted. The water is warm but suddenly shivers. A baby is born. Crying out for attention. Guys, I just heard a crazy news. Mark just turned down $1 million deal on Trust Mr. We have to investigate. Husband $1 million. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How can you reject this? First of all, who buy start of leaderboard with $1 million? Explain. &gt;&gt; How do I start? Someone reach out. They say that they want to buy trustmr for 1 million cash. I said no because I think the value was higher and I I just love the project. And then uh I realized that you know like when you do acquisitions and stuff you stay on board for a little bit and I I think I got scared of it. I wanted to work for myself so I don't want to work for someone if that makes sense. &gt;&gt; I like my cow free range like this. &gt;&gt; So because of that we said no. &gt;&gt; What is trust Mr. now? Because last time when we shared it on YouTube it was just the leaderboards. This is a bit crazy, but this is the massive pivot from a leaderboard to startup acquisition marketplace. So, initially the website looked like this. That's the leaderboard. And then you have this entire marketplace where all those startups here, those are the startups that are on sale. And when you like one, you go here, you say, I want to contact the seller. You enter your email here. Then once you're done, you enter this dashboard that I spend some time building. You have a conversation with the person. You agree on the price. to talk about whatever you want to sell like the domain name are you going to work with a person after you sell the startups and stuff what's the crazy part is every single day there is one startup that is acquired &gt;&gt; really already &gt;&gt; yeah because I think it's getting a lot of noise like I think it gets around 5 to 6,000 visitors per day the thing is I realized that building the marketplace is one thing but then after people have to do stuff create legal documents a letter of intent assess purchase agreement I had no idea what was it was so I had to do like some research and stuff and I built something in the app where you can draft all those legal documents You have those acquisition progress like you can draft an APA and then you enter all the legal stuff and you make a little signature right here. Haha. This will generate documents for you. Like AI is so good cuz then it makes those legals documents for me. Helps me make prepare those documents. And then the final part that's where the monetization of the marketplace come in. You need like a third party that you trust that you can send money to. you can send the assets to. Then it's time to transfer the assets to the buyer and then the third party sends back the money to the seller and boom, the transaction is done. And we do that with escrow at the moment. Most importantly, they handle disputes if you know you get scammed by someone. And those are all the new startups transactions that are listed almost every single day. In 4 for sale. I think selling your startup is kind of life-changing. You know, like if you make $1,000 per month with your startup, you can easily sell it for like 30 35,000. With $30,000, you go to Vietnam, Danong, whatever. You like a cheap Southeast Asia place. You leave for 2 years. You have 2 years of leftover. &gt;&gt; The parents reaction was also fun. &gt;&gt; Is it okay? &gt;&gt; I'm [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] proud of myself. I coach the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] camera with my dame [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] feet. I am a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] legend. When you work online probably our parent generation cannot really understand what we are doing. The moment when you sell your startup the way they look at you become different. Please don't feel alone even though you cannot be understood. Just keep working hard show your value and when you have the right moment you can harvest all those effort from you know selling your startup. Justin is the place to sell. But no, no, seriously, not to be jo like not to be like the goal is not to be salesy, but we sold three startups and every single time there's a little life-changing moment. It can give you some runover money that you know you can feel free to build more stuff. There are also websites like acquire.com and FIPA who are also places where you can sell. Actually, I sold two of the startups on acquire.com. &gt;&gt; Why people has to choose you rather than those two platforms? acquire.com and those platforms are more for bigger businesses. I think this is targeting like more indie businesses like we build. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Um so that has a better fit with the audience I think &gt;&gt; to ship it and sell it fast. &gt;&gt; Acquire fast. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Back to work. He has a bunch of features to ship. &gt;&gt; Let's let tonight's performance be the best performance. the Santes Iroas. This is about the Air Force memorial. You serious? &gt;&gt; I started to learn Greek uh for one week on Dualingo because we're staying in Greece to cyers for 2 months. So I thought learning Greek would be nice to talk with the locals and learning language is my passion. So why are we here? Why are we in Greece? &gt;&gt; Three things. Number one, we got to meet some entrepreneurs. Number two, &gt;&gt; there are many longevity hacks here. So, we're going to discover why they live that long cuz it looks like Greek people are very happy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I mean that's one of the real reason we're here because we want to build longevity hotels like a little place where you have like 10 mini villas, you know, you have like a super nice bedroom or soundproof. It's completely dark. You have a bed that is a cooling mattress. You have a air purifier. You have a food that is like prepared by a chef where it's approved to be very healthy. Since Greece is a an amazing place for this, we're looking for lens and stuff to see if that is possible. one less reason. &gt;&gt; We're leaving our home for 7 years. &gt;&gt; Bye-bye, Bali. And we're looking for a new place to, you know, just leave. And Greece is on the top of the list because it's amazing, sunny, good food, good people. So hopefully we find a home here, man. I think we have to go gym now. &gt;&gt; Good day start with a workout. &gt;&gt; I think there's some smell. I think it's all smell of PR. &gt;&gt; So, what is your goal? &gt;&gt; 120. &gt;&gt; 120 for how many reps? &gt;&gt; Three. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; This is my coach. &gt;&gt; 120. But you did last night. I can do 123 also because I have 1 1.25. &gt;&gt; 5 by 5. 12. &gt;&gt; Okay. Deal. &gt;&gt; This is breakfast for me. &gt;&gt; Nice. &gt;&gt; I don't even need to score. Not in the main course. &gt;&gt; What is this coming? &gt;&gt; 125. &gt;&gt; 125. Ah, it's your PR. &gt;&gt; It's three times bigger than your face. My gym rookie. &gt;&gt; Engage your either. Engage your &gt;&gt; fighting or watch out. &gt;&gt; You could have done five. &gt;&gt; Easy. &gt;&gt; Let's see. 1:30. 1:30. &gt;&gt; 1:30. &gt;&gt; 130. Sorry. &gt;&gt; Come on. Okay. &gt;&gt; I think he wants to make us do veget. &gt;&gt; How many kilo is it? &gt;&gt; 105. &gt;&gt; Wow. 105. through the hard times. I have to celebrate you, baby. I have to praise you. &gt;&gt; I am pumped as hell. So, a minute ago, I checked my emails and there is a deal on TrustMr, an acquisition deal for $100,000. And it's not just like random number like people spamming or anything. The deal is actually in escrow. And the papers have already signed the letter of intent, the um asset purchase agreement. Maybe this like little stupid marketplace that I launched a couple weeks ago is about to have a $100,000 deal. And since now the the marketplace is monetized, we're gonna get a 3% fee. So just like that, by facilitating the transaction, we're going to make $3,000. That is mad. That is completely crazy. &gt;&gt; So for the record, the monetization of the marketplace is like 48 hours old. I hope this happens. I will keep you posted. This guy just sold a startup for $85,000 on my little platform. Yogesh a couple months ago started to build his own startup and grow it from like zero to a couple thousand in monthly recurring revenue. Then he wanted to sell so he listed it on TrustMr for $100,000. He received six offers and among them one person said yes and they agreed on a transaction for $85,000. This is the biggest acquisition on Trust Mr. And in the same time, I earn a 3% finder fee. So, I made $2.6,000, which is also the biggest amount of money I earn in a single transaction. That makes me so excited because the platform is new. It's only 45 days old. So, who knows what could be happening in the future. And as a little motivation reminder, this entire website was born in like 8 hours just foding a little uh website and then I just built features that people requested. Even the marketplace thing was not a thing at the beginning. It was just I was just listening to someone who wanted to sell their startup on the platform and now it's paying the bills more than I would ever expect. So, uh, keep shipping those videos. &gt;&gt; Are we live? Yes, we're live. Good morning. It is 7:16. It is time to rock and roll. Today, I have a massive update to make. I need to try Clo after all those months of not trying it. I will build a mobile app with it. I hope I can make it in one day. That would be crazy. And yeah, just a regular day. We are rolling. &gt;&gt; Someone just bought the new monetization I tried for Trust Mr. which is since there are many people listing startups, I'm trying to add premium listing where people who list their startup, they'll get more visibility if they pay a little fee. So it goes from 99 for 30 days or 499 for uh also 30 days but get more visibility and that push the listing higher in the ranking algorithm and some perks like uh they can choose the colors of their listing so it stand out more it goes to the newsletter etc. And this is the startup of this new type of product I'm selling on trust R. Let's see how that goes. I think they got over 100 buyers checking out their page in the last couple of hours. The multiple is a little high. I think it's over nine multiple with like 50% profit margin. So, this will be a harder startup to sell. But, uh, you know, we never know. &gt;&gt; What happened? &gt;&gt; I was not expecting this. That's something to tell you. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. It's coming. &gt;&gt; Feels unreal. &gt;&gt; 17K. Yay. &gt;&gt; 3k to go until 20k. This is absolutely mind-blowing. So, everybody is talking about clo code at the moment. So far, I didn't have a good reason to use it. And then I realized I wanted to build a little mobile app for my software analytics like data fast. And I thought it would be a perfect use case to try clo code for the first time. And man, I'm so glad I tried. It's insane. So, first I built API endpoints for basically the entire data pass dashboard. If you're a dataf user now, you will see in the documentation is slide. You can literally get all your data fast data using your API key and you can build an entirely new dashboard if you want. Then I initiated cloud code and I just asked low code to go dive into datafast codebase and build a native mobile app for users to be able to just read their data using the newly created API endpoints and within 24 hours the app was done. It's mad. I have to show you how it works. So here now I can see the list of all of my websites and for each of them I have pretty much the same thing that I would see in my data fast dashboard. Revenue generated, where visitors are coming from, which pages they visit, which country they're coming from, the goals they complete. I can also see which refers make the most money. Less than a day of work, not typing a single word. I have no idea how to build iOS and Android apps. And this was entirely made with AI. This is absolutely insane. So right now the app is under review. So, if you are a Dataf Fast user, when this video is released, there is a very high chance that the app is also released on the store. So, go check out Dataf Fast in the app store. So, you can import all your analytics and just have your analytics on the go. Man, we live in a crazy world. &gt;&gt; Ah, man. Today is the my favorite and and most hated day. &gt;&gt; What is the day? &gt;&gt; V2 max. 1 km as fast as possible and then recovery for 1 km. &gt;&gt; So, you're going to kill yourself. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then we're going to have a lovely lunch. &gt;&gt; So, what is your goal of the speed? &gt;&gt; I think 345 per kilometer. I ain't trying to tell you what to do, but try to play cool. I ain't playing by your rules. Everything look better. &gt;&gt; Man, you killed me. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it was hardcore. Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Look at me. The protein and the vegetable baby. I playing by your rules. Everything better with a view. &gt;&gt; Bonjour. &gt;&gt; Data fast is finally live on product hunt after being in the shadow whatever not on product hunt for like 450 something plus days. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Product hunt of the day for data fast. I made this little demo video. I usually make those kind of videos when I want to launch a new product or an old product, but they haven't launched yet. I try to make them fun so they get a little bit of attention and that helps promote the launch. If you have 2 minutes of your life to lose, I'll add a link to this video on the description of this video if you want to watch it. Now, it's time to go. A girl and I typical desire in the water not a message from &gt;&gt; I shipped 21 features on trust Mr. in the last 3 months. AI has removed the gap from ideal and reality and we live in the best moment in the entire tech history. It's crazy. Just keep shipping. So far just hoping I seem wondering again. The wind around the window will felt the ice. The message of time down the window and now I'm thinking of the wind. The bottle in the ocean. The strikes the message from God for shows emotion.
