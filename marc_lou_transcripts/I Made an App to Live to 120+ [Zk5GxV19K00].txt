================================================================================

This is what happened when you book an entire business class. I wake up and make stuff I'm excited about. It's an app that has access to my entire health data. And from that moment, I remember nothing. Leave like a &gt;&gt; to leave until 120 years old. There are three important parts in the workout. &gt;&gt; I spent an entire day doing nothing. All right. &gt;&gt; Okay. Then sign the deal. [Music] We leaving Korea. No. &gt;&gt; You were leaving your parents. &gt;&gt; Oh, it was so nice living with them. &gt;&gt; It was really fun. Yeah. Literally one month going back as when we were teenagers. &gt;&gt; My favorite part was eating breakfast with parents all together and we talk about life. The more I grow up, the more I appreciate family time and have a deeper connection as a same adult. And they're very supportive of what we do with this even though it's not very their world. I think we're boarding right now. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Welcome to how we on right now. Okay. Bye. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. Pokémon everywhere. Hello Pikachu. Even the wing has a samurai bird. &gt;&gt; This is what happened when you book an entire business class. [Applause] I got Alex Ori on the line. He's asking me, "How did we get so rich?" &gt;&gt; What's your favorite flight? Sorry. &gt;&gt; It's about AGI and super intelligent. It would be the biggest revolution ever. It's already here, but it's the beginning of something much bigger. Hello Mark. &gt;&gt; Hey. What's up? &gt;&gt; Do you remember this? &gt;&gt; Holy moly. That's good old times, right? &gt;&gt; Happy anniversary. It's been 8 years together. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's true. All those photo of us, we were party so hard. &gt;&gt; Do you remember him? Frank? &gt;&gt; Yeah, Frank. Of course. He let us meet. No. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was actually doing teo teo with me in Korea and in the Korean culture the you know, you go drink soju after you're done. And he's a good drinker and he made me drink some soju and I was like I just remember the dinner and then after he was like, "Hey, you know, let's go clubbing and stuff." And I know you were you and like people from the startup center were at a certain club. So we went to that club and from that moment I remember nothing. Complete blackout. &gt;&gt; So our love blew from the darkness. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a nice way to put it. Yeah, we were drunk as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; In Korea, when when we live together, we always partied, sleep at 1:00 a.m. or even later. &gt;&gt; Yeah, even later. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we always went to convenience store like eating the cheap sugary food. Our health was really, really bad back then. You could tell from the photos. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, things has been changed. I think when we started the jumping rope jute workout. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because we were very poor back then. So, we couldn't afford gym. So, we just follow the jumping rope guys free workout routine. So, we used to go to the park on the top of the mountain. &gt;&gt; And then we were so poor. I remember the breakfast we were having. We knew nuts were healthy, but also nuts are expensive. And we were sharing like 30 g of nuts. fleet into. And then we went to Bali and I think there's a second time of change because we were surrounded by all those like healthy fitness people. &gt;&gt; There was something that triggers in the brain. We're good about diets and workouts and we stopped drinking alcohol around this time, but there was still this mindset of like, oh, I got to wake up early and I got to do my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and it doesn't matter if I sacrifice an hour or two of sleep because I can work harder. And I remember that costed me a burnout. Like I was not thinking clearly because I was wanting to grind more. Then I read the book and I was like, "Oh, maybe we ditch the alarm, the morning clock." And then we started to prioritize sleep again. And then we feel so much better. &gt;&gt; But still health is really hard cuz even though we do everything so well, &gt;&gt; there are some days that you feel very tired, negative. We actually track our health through oop the fitness like the health tracker. It says the record is great. my recovery is the best and I slept well but still I feel tired so I feel like there is another reason we cannot connect the dots &gt;&gt; that's kind of what I want to do with bio age I hope that eventually there are patterns between workouts food supplements and sleep and eventually you realize like oh if I eat this food too much then my sleep is disturbed and I also think there's a little bit of randomness in life we're now robots so it's also normal that days we're tired and days we're not tired &gt;&gt; well we're lucky to have each other always motivate each other to be healthier and not giving up and we are trying to find a reason together. So maybe this week we check our routine with body weight and see who is getting younger more cuz we're very competitive. So if we are playing game I think I'll be even more excited to keep up my health routine and nail it. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; What's going on? &gt;&gt; I spent the entire day making this video and I got nothing. I literally got nothing. I wasted the entire day. &gt;&gt; What kind of video? &gt;&gt; Launch video for that. &gt;&gt; What's blocking you? You couldn't find nice idea. &gt;&gt; I have beats of ideas and I cannot stitch everything together and I try different stuff and it didn't work and it was super [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] So you're doing at least 10k step today to build &gt;&gt; not even that's why I run &gt;&gt; I didn't I achieved nothing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; you know all the great philosopher they had to walk to have amazing idea. So I think you're on the right track. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm far from being a great philosopher because I cannot even come up with a freaking video for it to launch. God damn it. &gt;&gt; It's time to go to bed. True. Actually, very true. &gt;&gt; 1 hour before going to bed, we wind down. &gt;&gt; I know, but I feel so guilty. &gt;&gt; It's okay. Tomorrow will be a new day. And it's better to sleep to turn off your brain so you can restart strong. &gt;&gt; I know. &gt;&gt; Such a terrible day. I'll make something out of this. I'll be back tomorrow and I'll make a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] banger video and nobody will know that I spent an entire day doing nothing. But it doesn't matter because the video will be out there. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Just outcome is important. No more blue light. We're going to the cave. We always set up AC 18°, no sunlight. Wow, look at this magical room. &gt;&gt; Good night. &gt;&gt; I just woke up and for the past hour or so, I was in a weird conscious unconscious mindset. I was kind of thinking of yesterday and I think I found the video I want to make. Actually, here's a little teaser of what's coming. &gt;&gt; Straighten your back, stand tall, and walk over to her. &gt;&gt; Hi. Uh, I see you there. And I I didn't want to regret not talking to you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Why? &gt;&gt; Um, it's because, uh, I really have, &gt;&gt; Mark, open up your chest and look straight. &gt;&gt; Might be a complete flop, but I think I got something. So, I guess she was right. Sometimes you just got to let it go, turn the computer off, and start again fresh the next day. Okay, now it's time for coffee. Time to enjoy the sunrise, go to the gym, and get this done. Look at this first papaya tree of our house. Good morning. It's already time to do workout. Today Mark went to surf. So I will show you how we do training to leave until 120 years old. There are three important parts in workout. First lift the weight three to four times a week. Second run two to three times a week. Third, walk 10k steps per day. So, I'll show you how we train in daily life. Chip makes our workout routine. Usually, two times of lower body, two times of upper body. And today is shorter and chest day. So, let's train. Wait before you cannot miss coffee before workout. Drive slow. &gt;&gt; So, we just finished the workout and I'm so starving. Let's see what's in the fridge today. &gt;&gt; Oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; She's taking over the YouTube channel. This used to be Mark channel. Now it's WJI channel. Da da da. The meal prep makes the life so much easier. So, we prepared all the ingredient once a week and it makes us so much easier to eat healthy because I just threw all the ingredient to the plate and change the sauce daily. One time of hard work saved the whole week. One, two, three. Tada! Lunch is ready. As a finisher, we're going to put Brian Jen, extra virgin oil, and apple vinegar cider to lower the blood sugar. Welcome to our vegan day. Every dinner with tofu, tempe, beans, and every two to three days, we eat full day of vegan meals. On the bio age, we updated the goal. Every meal we take a photo then it will calculate how much calorie, protein, carb, all those macronutrient but also the sory fat and sugar level. &gt;&gt; This app I think it's probably one of my least used app yet the one we use &gt;&gt; the most &gt;&gt; the most. &gt;&gt; Yeah, true. &gt;&gt; Every single feature added there is because you requested or I needed it. Actually that's um I think it could be an interesting topic. There are lots of people who build stuff with the intent to make money. This one is really an app made for now for us and you can tell by the landing page. It's the most anti- business landing page I've ever made. &gt;&gt; So, is it different from your previous apps? &gt;&gt; Not really in the sense that every apps I've made are apps that I would at some point need. I think it's coming from the frustration of 2018 when I was working for escape room businesses and I gave zero [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] about escape rooms. like not in a bad way. The tons of problems to fix that I just don't care about and this one was one of them. And now I'm really trying to focus on building only apps that I experienced the problem. That's how she pass was born. &gt;&gt; That's how fast &gt;&gt; cuz the course I wish I had. Yeah, exactly. And then most most of the time data pass cuz I really want a a tool for me that is like my founder dashboard where I see my revenue traffic etc. And bio age now for health. I want to wake up and make stuff I'm excited about. For me, I have to care about I have to have the problem to care. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, scratch your own itch. &gt;&gt; Scratch own. &gt;&gt; What are you doing? &gt;&gt; I'm being photographed by Paparazzi in the lounge in Malik. &gt;&gt; We have something we haven't finished. &gt;&gt; Oh no. She's always competing against me. &gt;&gt; We need to see the results before going to France. &gt;&gt; Oh no. &gt;&gt; The game we started in Bali must finish in Bali. Before showing the results, can you say how hard you tried versus how hard I tried? &gt;&gt; We'll see the result first. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; I'm 18 years old, which means 15 years younger. &gt;&gt; So, actually soon I will be doing illegal stuff &gt;&gt; cuz I married a a minor. &gt;&gt; Recently, I picked up running and that really gave my cardio health like improved so much. And of course by weight helped very much. Hopefully we can see all those diet, sleep, exercise, like blood test all in one tab so that we can have a consultation with the AI. &gt;&gt; I know. I know. I know. I know. Like as soon as we land in France, we're going to be there for a couple of weeks. I'm going to lock the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I'll build like crazy. I'll ship like crazy. &gt;&gt; Okay, then let's go to France and make this bio happen. We're walking to the gate and we have to do our usual routine, &gt;&gt; the daily check. &gt;&gt; When we shoot the Korea vlog, it was 5,000 and we're already 6K almost. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amazing. &gt;&gt; Crazy. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You're going to eat so much. &gt;&gt; How do you feel? &gt;&gt; I'm excited to have some cheese. &gt;&gt; Cheese? You mean my saturated fat? &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Look in, man. Just look the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Look at this, man. What is this doing? &gt;&gt; You know, I shipped funnels on that fast and I tested the new headline and new hero section for the entire website to convert more people. So, this is the funnel for 2 weeks before I made the change. And this is the funnel for 2 weeks after the change. The conversion rate from landing page to signing up went from 4.5% to 6.2. I completely changed the hero section and I give interactive demo and I change the entire headline. &gt;&gt; We're final in Paris. &gt;&gt; I'm building an app to leave until 120 years old. At least I hope so. The goal itself is not to leave uh super long. The goal itself is especially to have fun in this journey cuz uh being healthy makes me happy. Being happy is what I thrive for. So I'm building this little thing called bio age which uh tagline is your body's operating system. It's really work in progress. Basically it's an app that has access to my entire health data. So it knows my sleep from my wearables. It knows how much nutrients I intake through snapping photos of my food. It knows uh how well is my exercise going like um through again my wearables. It has access to my biomarkers. So I just upload blood tests here and then it extract them the important ones. And then what I hope will be the core feature of this app is the AI chat. This is basically chipt trained on my own health data as context. It knows again what I eat, what I do, how I sleep, my blood sugar, etc. And I hope that by doing so I will be able to find patterns for some reason. Maybe some days I feel like a little more tired, some days I underperform my workouts, my run, whatever. So for instance, I can ask, do I drink too much coffee? Does it seem to disturb my sleep? And then here I give this AI a bunch of tools. A tool to uh check what is my last night of sleep to uh see sleep patterns for the past 30 days to uh see if there's caffeine uh intake inside of my food intake. There really are a bunch of stuff. It's work in progress. So, as you can see, it's actually terrible. Something might have been wrong here. But I I just hope that after grinding more on this little weekend side project, I will be able to get an AI that is extremely smart, that is trained on all my health context, and able to tell me how to improve my overall health. Judg might kill my startup really soon, but hey, it doesn't matter. I'm having fun building this one, and it's all about enjoying the journey.
