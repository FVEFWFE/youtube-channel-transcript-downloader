================================================================================

so I get just earn $1,000 and here is my reward who's the boss I'll never forget my first customers it's a wonderful feeling to make money on the internet with my own little creation so in this video I'm going to show you how I use hiker news to drive well over 25,000 visitors for my software AI tools and habit trackers you'll see there are some patterns you can replicate to get visibility and customers for your own project but there are some very strong codes on hiker news and if you don't want your post to go seen or worst getting banned you want to avoid the three mistakes I will share at the end of the video let's go at the very beginning of the journey when I just got started and had zero experience I launched mood to movie on hicker news and within a few hours the post went viral it got 5,000 visitors at the beginning and I didn't know but it was the spark of something way bigger there are tons of other platforms that feed off hiker news content and when they see top performing post they will usually reshare the content later and so occasionally I would see my app movie being re-shared on other Platforms in Tik Tok news lators and other Tech aggregators and sometimes even in languages I don't understand a few months later I replicated the exact same formula for my habit tracker called habits garden and the post went viral again hitting the front page of haer news and this time the app was monetized so I made a couple $100 and also reach 100 Mr within just a few days and I keep replicating the same formula over and over for the past 2 and a half years and even though not every post will go viral it usually bring good traffic and customers for my own project and I'm going to share exactly what I learned if you don't know what hiker news is it's a tech news aggregator read by developers software Engineers it's run by the community so anyone can post anything and other people vote and choose which post goes up or down and you will see why this is important for us later it was created by y combinator the famous startup incubator so there is a special category for people like you and I to share our own little startups even though we don't aim to build unicorns let me show you the results I got with that the first thing you want to do is to post in the right place in hiker news there are a bunch of category only one matters to us it's the show Hacker News category this is a place where people like you and I where we can share our own little project when you submit your post write show hn column before your title that way your post will automatically be posted in the right category of hiker news first your post will be shown in the/ new subcategory it's a mandatory Place uh every new post has to go through and if it gets a couple of OD votes then he will go to the SL show category I suspect there is a moderator that checks the quality of those post so follow along with the uh things not to do later because this is very important if you want to be promoted if your post is promoted to the slash show category you will get a bunch of traffic couple thousands of traffic as well as a lot of comments and feedback from the community and sometimes if you're very lucky your post will appear in the slash category the main homepage of Hacker News I've never been there but I've seen some other Indie makers reaching that stage and you get crazy traffic all right so the second part to increase your chances to go viral is to be very personal you are not a faceless Corporation trying to make more money you are a cool developer building cool apps in your bedroom or after your 9 to5 and you want to showcase that start your post with something very personal saying things like I made I built or after 6 months coding blah blah blah those usually go pretty well just tell your own story with simple words all right the third part is you want to use The Hacker News language it's a community that's read by developers and Tech enthusiasts so you want to talk to them and for that you want to use Tech words like GPT for SEO or whatever llm is being released at time of the video if you're using generic words like a course coaching or e-commerce it's likely to be ignored unless you turn it into a techy world for instance my habit tracker called habits Garden is just a simple habit trucker but the fact that there are some uh games features like leaderboards and competing with friends I use the word gamified I gamified a habit tracker to fight procrastination and thanks to that the post went viral and get well over 10,000 visitors so you won to make sure to include some kind of techy words in your post the fourth and probably the most important tip is to tell the outcome your post will be competing against dozens of other higher News Post and you have 60 characters to convince someone to click on your post and for that you want to tell exactly what people will get by clicking on it all the product we buil serves a purpose and you want to showcase that part in your title why is it worth my time what's makes it special how is it going to help me if it helps I have a simple formula I use pretty much all the time I start with I made to be personal then I include the product with if possible a tech word like a nextg boiler plate and then I tell the outcome like to ship startups faster or to automate all the boring stuff and finally you want to contribute after you make your own post go in the comment section and write the first comment and explain your story like hey I'm Mark and I realized I was spending lots of money for stripe invoices so I built an alternative show people that you're an actual human behind the post tell them your story tell them what may you create these products and if your PO get up and start to get some traffic you will get some genuine comments from hiker news readers they're usually pretty rough but they're also pretty accurate and they give good feedbacks make sure to reply to comments and ask question because that could be really helpful for you to know which features next to build for your product all right now three mistakes you really want to avoid if you don't want your post to go unseen or even worse getting banned the first one is to avoid emojis don't ask me why Hacker News doesn't like emojis so don't use them the second mistake and probably the most common one I actually made did in my post got B is to ask for up votes unlike other platforms like product tant where you can ask friends and family to support you on hiker news it's against their policies as I said before I believe there is a person that decides which post can be promoted from the show new category to the show category and I'm pretty sure that moderator has access to some more data that we have so for instance if you send your Hacker News Post to friends and family the moderator will see that the traffic is coming directly from that link or that the up votes were made by new Hacker News accounts which looks pretty suspicious instead of asking for super ort spend more time crafting your headline because this is how your post can go viral and finally do not overthink it there is very little you can do to influence the reach of your post so make sure you craft a good headline post it and move on your first post might not be the one that goes viral but if you keep repeating the same strategy over and over you increase your odds of winning there are many ways to get traffic for your startup even if you don't have an audience I'm working on making those videos to help you get customers and if you don't want to miss them out you can subscribe to the channel and there is a link to my blog in the description of this video where I
