================================================================================

let's talk about Tex Tac I get a lot of suggestion from software Engineers who mention that I could save some money by switching to another text Tac or maybe a new UI components Library that's trendy but I never listen to them and I always stick to the exact same text stack and thanks to that in the last 2 years I was able to ship 21 products and those products are getting 260,000 page views per month and are making over $50,000 in revenue and I'm working solo and I handle the customer support and there is barely any problem and the Tex tack only cost 67 us per month all right now let me show you exactly the tech that I use all right so for the front end part I use reactjs it's a very popular JavaScript library it has a bunch of extra Library like drag and drop features for instance that can plug and play right away and some people say that it's quite complicated I only know 10% of reacts I just use use State and use effects in 99% of the cases it's way enough for all my apps then I pack all that into a nextjs application it's very good for page routing and to have nice page is ranking on Google and it's also super easy to use to style my apps I use tawin CSS I feel like it's much easier than CSS because the style is return return directly on the right HTML tags so it's easy for me to understand what's going on and on top of that I use a UI Library called Daisy UI it has a bunch of components like uh buttons form cards that make things way faster to ship there are a bunch of new design Trends popping up every day which means new UI components libraries coming out and to me that's just distraction customer don't care if I'm using the latest gradient colors or whatever so I stick to that UI Library it's clear it's simple they have 30 or 20 plus themes that I can customize so whenever I ship a new app I would pick a theme and find a cool type face on Google phones and boom I have an entirely design cool looking apps that's up and running all right and for the backend part for my API I would use next year's serverless functions whenever I clone a Nexus project I just add a file in the API folder and I have an entire API endpoint that's up and running I don't need to install packages I don't need to maintain an OS it's just working so well for me and I never had any trouble with overcharge for several less so all good with that for the database I use mongodb I don't know why developers don't like mongodb I love it it's so simple I click a button I open a new database and in minutes I can make queries and I can add anything I want to that database it's just so simple and I absolutely love it I set up a m0 cluster for each new project that I start which is free and just in case things go wrong I do occasional backups cost me about $10 per month and so if something goes wrong I can still use a database backup and restore all the previous data when I'm coding on my computer I use a local version of mongodb that lets me avoid making a network request to the production database when I'm coding so I can code in a train in a plane remote somewhere in the countryside if there is no internet and the the database is here and I can do everything I want and I also don't mess up the production database just in case on top of mongodb I add mongus which simplifies the queries they're more English friendly I would say all right and all my apps use user logins to send things like magic links so that they can sign up with a secure token I would use mun as an email provider for that it's free to get started it's super easy and you can set up a bunch of domains that you want for each of the apps at the moment I'm recording the video I spend three to four us per month in order to send 3 to 4,000 emails which I think is really cheap and finally I use stripe in order to process payments whether it's onetime payments subscriptions credits it works for literally anything stripe API is a little bit daunting when you are getting started there are a bunch of things going on so I will link to an article that I wrote to help you handle stripe subscriptions all right so for the hosting part where my websites are actually leing I use versal for that uh so I push my changes to a GitHub repo and then versal automatically pulls the changes that I made and deploys it to versal instance and I have 21 projects running on versal at the moment it gets over 50,000 visitors a month and I still pay $20 a month so overall pretty good really happy with versal and the Simplicity it's bringing and all my databases are hosted on mongod DB Atlas where I have over 21 clusters and most of them are m0o cluster which are free to monitor data to actually see what's going on in my apps I use a few Services first is plausible it's a simple script analytics that lets me track how many visitors are my my site and sometimes occasionally I will track events like did people click on that button or not it's costing me $29 per month at the moment which is surprisingly the most expensive part of my text te if I receive a customer email support and something goes wrong there's a bug that I don't know where it's coming from I will check the virtual deployment logs it's free to check the last 24 hours and it's usually when I catch the bug and for advanced monitoring things like split testing I would do it manually with the database I would store some kind of like integer in the database randomly and then just make the relevant query in the database see I don't let's say like the last 100 sign up customers filter them by their split test number and see which one purchased which one didn't I don't use any other services for that because I barely track any data and if I need to I would just use the raw mongodb queries and finally some of my products need specific features so for instance I would use AI models for products like logo fast where I help people generate logos or for Workbook PDF to help the help again people will generate workbook to learn a new language I use GPT for under the hood and I spend about $20 per month in open AI credit if I need any other cloud services I would go to Amazon web services the two most common that I use are awss 3 a big bucket where I can host images and this is what I use on Indie page where people upload pictures of their startups or their profile picture this is where the image would go and I also use from time to time AWS think cloud front it say CDN so images or videos load faster for things like a course for instance and a final touch it is not really part of a text tack but I hire a junior software engineer called GitHub co-pilots it cost me $10 per month and it's helping me code way faster I'll link to another video I made about how I turn on a startup ID into the first $1,000 in 4 days using GitHub copilot when I learned how to code I remember struggling finding the perfect text tack but I wish I knew this text tack don't matter customer don't care about the visible what matters is that you pick one text Tack and you stick to it it's like a muscle the more you practice one rep the more comfortable you'll get with it and the faster you'll be able to do it and the faster you ship the faster you'll get customers all right that's the end of the video as always if you like the video you can like the video if you loved it you can subscribe to the Channel please also let me know in the comments if there are any topics you would like me to cover and until the next video just ship it cheers by the way I got someone to help me edit those videos so I can spend more time building apps please let me know what you think about the editing
