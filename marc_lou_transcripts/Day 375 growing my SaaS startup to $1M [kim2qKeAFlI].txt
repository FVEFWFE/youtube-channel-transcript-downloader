[music] Let's talk about the future of this YouTube channel. There will be some failures. Spend an entire day doing nothing. Some learnings. There will be [music] some new features. &gt;&gt; Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] [laughter] It's amazing. There's your photo on the map. This is going to be the entire journey. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this. Growing a software business to a million [music] dollar in valuation. I'm going to polish this and ship it. &gt;&gt; It's AKM R. &gt;&gt; If you think about it, it's crazy though. &gt;&gt; Don't you dare. Don't you dare. &gt;&gt; We just can't believe what just happened. &gt;&gt; We did 400 MR in 2 days. &gt;&gt; Crazy. So, what is our MR now? &gt;&gt; 7K. &gt;&gt; 7K. The growth is crazy. &gt;&gt; Let's see right here. &gt;&gt; Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] The subscriber turn rate is 6.8%. This is the lowest it [music] has ever been and it's down 27%. And we pass 500 subscribers. 500 paying customers. If you think about it, this is crazy, you know. 500 people who agrees to have their credit card charged by the end of each month by me. 500 people. It's like a plane of people and they're like they're flying with us and they're like, "Hey, it's okay. Here's my credit card numbers. At the end of the month, you can charge it because the product is good enough. [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yes, as sun going to the moon. Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Actually, the thing is dataf fast price double on 31st October. That's what I said on Twitter a couple days ago and I think some people were in between subscribing and I want to be cuz people help me build this thing, right? I have a customer support. People tell me feedback and I just build what they say. Mhm. &gt;&gt; So thanks to the people who've been using this app from the beginning who trusted the app when there was nothing we've been able to build like this little SAS that now people like and [clears throat] so all the I don't know 600 700 previous customers they can keep the current price if they subscribe before October 31st or if they keep their subscription and because of that then the MR like just the [music] growth went from like growing 20% month over month to like 37% month over month now. &gt;&gt; So are you saying we have to increase the price often? [laughter] &gt;&gt; December we quadruple the price. Yes. It never stops. No, I think it's crazy and I think also it's fun because it picked and then it went flat for a couple days and then recently I announced this new feature. Yeah, you can see icons of people and so whenever someone mentioned data fast then then data fast will scout Twitter and then this is a visual feature. And I think a lot of people join because of that. Literally every single hour there's someone there's there are multiple at least two people mentioning that fastest. &gt;&gt; Here's a tip. Make a new viral feature. So make people talk about it. So the word of mouth it will grow your says very fast. &gt;&gt; Make it so freaking good that people cannot resist but share it. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Mr. 10k. Yay. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Come and set me free. &gt;&gt; Looks like you. &gt;&gt; Let's Let's talk about the future of this YouTube channel. Well, if you're new here, uh my name is Mark. I have built over 30 little websites in the past 3 years. Most of them failed. One of them changed my life. And it's a bit cliche, but I made enough money to not have to think about making money. And so that leaves rooms for experiments like uh growing a little software business to a million dollar in valuation, which is exactly what those new uh YouTube videos that I'm going to put out are going to be about. If you're wondering, a million dollar in valuation, it's basically around $20,000 in monthly recurring revenue. And then if you apply a multiple of four, you'll get a million dollar in valuation. This is just a fancy generic uh goal I give myself just to have something to snack on to know if I'm heading towards the right path. And in this uh new format of YouTube videos, I'm basically going to be documenting everything. So it's a behind the scenes of growing this software business. Uh there will be some failures, there will be some learnings, there will be some new features I build, there will be some AI uh lots of AI, lots of coffee as well. And I also believe that uh this new form of entrepreneurship is not just about the business itself, but also about the life around the business. So it wouldn't really be fun for me if I was not able to choose when I work uh go travel whenever I want to decide to just randomly on a Thursday afternoon watch a movie with my wife. So there will be a little bit of these too. Uh there will be some workouts. There will be some random diet experiments I'm trying in order to uh feel better in my body. There will be some health related stuff. There will be some travel across the world in those videos. This is going to be the entire uh journey. I'd like to do a little bit of everything and this is exactly what you're going to see in those videos. And talking about this, it is time for workouts. &gt;&gt; Let's make lots of [music] money. You got the brains. Let's make lots of money. It's working, bro. If people send with a real profile picture, then I'm going to see their real face on the map like this guy. &gt;&gt; That's why you're dancing like this. &gt;&gt; Yeah, we're cooking. We're cooking. AI is cooking for us and we're dancing. Soon this map will be filled with avatars of my users. It's coming real. You know, it's like you see real. You're like, "Oh my god, this guy with this profile picture in this country is using my app at the moment." Yes. Okay. Real demo. Real freaking demo. You are going to sign up for that pass. Okay. Okay, you logged in. Holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] This is you. You're on the map. It's amazing. There's your photo on the map. Okay, this might be another useless feature, but now people can send metadata with data fast. This is coming alive. Yeah, &gt;&gt; Mark is super locked in and I'm afraid he's out of his mind now. I &gt;&gt; got to [music] polish this and ship it. Cheers. &gt;&gt; Let's pray the MR gods, &gt;&gt; please. [screaming] &gt;&gt; It's AKM RR. It took just 10 days [music] to get 1K MR. &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait. The math is really fun. 4 month to 1K MRR, 3 months to 2K MR, 2 months to 3K MR, 1 month to 4K MRR, 3 weeks to [music] 5K, 2 weeks to 6K, and then very similar like 14 days and 10 days to 7 and 8. Don't you dare give up. Don't you dare. &gt;&gt; Why? You worked for a whole day. You lost track of time. You don't know what time to eat, what time to work out. &gt;&gt; Today was mental. Like I have a to-do list that is this big. Every single day there are more stuff added on the list and it makes me freaking addicted to just bam bam, you know? Like I just tick all those tasks and it's fun. &gt;&gt; How do you make that work fun and have a monster amount of focus? &gt;&gt; You and I, we've been struggling a long time for how to make work fun. The very very hardest is when you get started &gt;&gt; because there's no results. &gt;&gt; Maybe it depends also for people. For me, it really is about what people think, how people pursue my work. The fact that people like it, it gives value to my work. It makes me like, "Oh, wow. I want to do more of this." &gt;&gt; Then for people who don't have the traction yet, what how would you say &gt;&gt; exactly what I did 2022, which is like you really have to frame this work as little piece of a collection, which is your creation. Could be a website, could be videos you make, could be Instagram posture, share, whatever, or tweets. It doesn't matter if it flops. It's just you're building it. Yeah. I think at the beginning, that's how I found motivation. In the end, there's only one answer is to ship and run down to [music] taking away to the dark side. I want to be your left [singing] man. &gt;&gt; I love you when you sing. I got in [music] my life
