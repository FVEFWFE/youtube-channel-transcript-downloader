================================================================================

in February 2024 I launched one new startup and added two sources of revenue to my income in total I made $4,250 as a solo entrepreneur with zero employee in this video I'm going to break down everything that I did this month and also why my revenue is down from $57,000 in January 2024 and finally a new routine that I found that helped me produce a better and deeper quality uh work let's get started I spent most of February working on Zenvo my new startup it is a no code tool for stripe users to let their customers generate invoices themselves uh without having to pay for the stripe fee I got this startup ID when I realized uh I gave stripe $1,600 Us in 2023 to generate invoices for my own startups it was a bitter feeling uh the option was turned off by default but I just didn't realize I turn it on after that I decided to turn off the option and then my emails were flooded with customers asking for invoices uh mostly Europeans who need to have well structured invoices with vat and so I had a new startup ID born there was something painful and there was also a financial outcome it would actually save me money uh to build a startup so I built it and I wanted to do something different I built it live on YouTube uh with uh you guys who came and join the streaming it was really fun to connect and also it helped me be more productive so so I would have to show up every day and I cannot just go on Instagram and CH chill when I'm on YouTube so uh overall it was really fun to be doing this um although the entire setup um you know relying on uh Bell internet connection which sometimes drop off uh was a bit stressful but it was overall really fun experience that I'm probably going to do uh one more time this year I spent about 8 Days building that startup Live on YouTube and once it was done I launched it everywhere um I actually shared a video of that launch day uh in the channel in my live videos You'll see the day probably nine is the day we launched it I went on product hunt Twitter hicker news uh Reddit uh I made little videos for that and the product got somewhere around 4,000 visitors within the first 24 hours which also got the first customers to my surprise it got the attention of some people like gear Mo R the COO of versal a billion dooll company I think he enjoyed the little notification popup that I created this is absolutely crazy to me as I am just a little uh internet maker alone in my room and I get the attention of really famous people like this it was just mind-blowing also Peter levels uh of the most prolific Indie makers out there retweeted the launch um and that kind of made my day and added a bunch of visitors as well overall the launch was pretty successful it made $2,000 within the first week of launching and I have some promising signs that uh there is a potential for this startup because customers would email me that saying oh finally a solution for that so it feels like I'm relieving a pain for some people which is a promising ID for the future all right now let's talk about my product bringing the most revenue shiest shiest is a botle plate for programmers to ship startups faster it made $39,000 this month which is down from $49,000 back in January this year it went down maybe because uh it's been 6 month that been running the product it has made almost $300,000 and it might be fair to say that it has reached the the EOS the tech ecosystem and there is some kind of Market saturation going on or uh maybe it's just me uh not spending enough time marketing it uh I'm not so sure about that but at this point it really doesn't matter because um I receive messages from people who are actually shipping startups and making money online thanks to ship Fest and that really fires me up I also added two new components to the boiler plate thanks to the launch of Zenvo uh there is now a new testimonial component as well as a with and without competent my four other startups had a steady Revenue this month bringing about $3,000 um I have no customer support whatsoever so this is some kind of true passive income if I may but this would not be possible if I didn't have an audience of 75,000 people on Twitter talking about Twitter I made $250 in February from the creators earning Revenue nothing crazy but I'm just happy to have this little income income stream and also added 5,000 new followers and if you just join discover my Twitter thank you and finally I added a new uh stream of income to my Revenue it is YouTube I just got U 5,000 subscribers on YouTube uh this is just mind-blowing I think my Twitter following helped a lot and my channel got monetized a few weeks back and I already made almost $50 uh which compared to Twitter Twitter is pretty nice and it's just so fun like it's a New Journey and I'm just so happy to keep going making those videos and this month I started to follow Brian Johnson's blueprint routine in order to improve my health and this was a mistake I bought a uh sleep tracker in order to calculate my sleep score by the end of the night and I realized that the Deeds got me really anxious because I was getting obsessed getting the perfect sleep score which ironically would keep me awake at night and make my sleep score worse so I ditched the ring I got back to my simple routine where I don't work past 6: p.m. my wife and I would go out of the house because that's where we work at night we would stretch play games uh read books whatever uh which is not work and my overall uh sleep would be really good actually in the past 5 years or so I have put sleep as my number one priority without tracking the data it literally changed my life it made me much more motivated to work uh it improved my creativity made me um better at handling Stress and Anxiety this is by far what has impacted my life the most if you can take care of your sleep all right that's it for February for the month of March I expect pretty much all my Revenue to go down because I have a really big project that I want to focus on um I expect it to be about 3 to six month of work which is a little bit daunting uh I'm a little bit stressed about it but I think it is the right thing to do and so I'm going to go uh on holiday and disconnect a little bit from the internet and spend some times on that project um I will also document everything I can on YouTube so if you want to follow along uh you can subscribe to my channel and if you are looking for another video to watch um you can watch a day in my life as a solo entrepreneur living in B I hope you like the video if you liked it you can like it cheers
