================================================================================

all right we are 20 hours after the launch day and my software already got 1.6 th000 users registered I was also selected to be the product of the day and I got this little badge right here and the crazy part is that two weeks ago the idea didn't even exist so in this video I'm going to show you how I got a bunch of startups ID I'm also going to show you the product and the text tack that I use and some methods I use to build a product in around 7 days and some software Engineers will not like this part of the video and finally I'm going to cover the launch day and how I managed to get around 7,000 visitors on my lening page let's go how do you find startups ideas this is one of the most common question that I get asked on my channel and the answer is a little bit counterintuitive when I started the Journey about 6 years ago I was brainstorming startup ideas for hours like sometimes even days thinking I will come up with something magical and I implemented those IDs and none of them actually worked but about a year ago I started to stop thinking about ideas and instead I started to build stuff whatever it is and then I would stumble up across problems all the time like DNS issues or like knowledge uh issues or like I don't know where to launch my startups I don't know how to do this I don't know how to do that and then now my lease is filled with startups ideas for instance for the software I just launched here is how I got the idea I have built 24 products and seven of them are making money and I want to build better products for people so I as them what they want to use and for that I use a feedback management tool called Kenny it's a little feedback board where people can suggest features and upot them so I know which one to prioritize the problem with Kenny is that first it's made for a big company so it's very cluttered there's a bunch of features and is very complicated for soloers like me and the second problem with Kenny is that if you have more than one product it cost at least $99 per month which is an insane amount of money for a feedback tool and just like this I had this idea of building an alternative to Kenny that is much simpler for smaller markets the niche of solopreneurs so instead of looking for ideas I buil solutions to problems I experience and chances are I'm not unique so many other people might have the exact same problem as me and they might be in need of my product and when I launch it I saw that many other solopreneurs experience the exact same frustration with other feedback management tools and that's how I know I have a product that uh will be used by users so unless you have been working for a company for 10 years and you know that there's some uh pains in their workflow like they're slow for this or they struggle to hire people then you might be able to have a good startups idea born from that but if you're uh a guy just like me and you spend most of your time home and you just want to build apps chances are you don't really have a problem that can be solved with a digital product so the way to find good startups IDs is to actually to build something anything rebuild a habit tracker that you use make a not taking app a grocery app for you and your family build anything along the way you're going to stumble across problems whether it's not knowing how to implement this feature or struggling with DNS Rec course or maybe it's even a marketing issue and you don't know where to launch your startups and these problems will give you tons of startups ideas so the way to find good ideas is to think less and build more all right now let me show you the text tack I use and how I build a product in 7 days and let's start with a quick demo of the software okay so this is the demo of inso the little feedback management tool I created this is the landing page I like to make interactive demo on the left so the cards are clickable and this is the landing page here for the feature part I like to have some interactivity so it makes people want to discover more so if you hover with your mouse you'll see all the little thing moving here and there and that's pretty much it for the landing page uh once you are signed up as an admin you will see all the feedback boards right here so this is the one that I use for inso as an admin I can change a few stuff here so I can change the themes to match my brand I can also uh manage the feedback that are being given by users uh this one was canceled because I fixed it I can change say that I'm working on this one or I Shi that feature and then there is a public uh dashboard link where on the right side we have all the features suggested by users once they're logged in they can uh click to upot them they can also suggest any features they want right here and they can have a conversation on each uh feedback given if they uh want to add more things there so here is the text tack I use to build this software and this is the exact same text tack I use for all my 23 websites when I don't change my text tack I don't procrastinate and I can focus on shipping features and product it's a nextjs repo so the front end and as well as the back end I have the little API routes by nextjs everything is handled with next I also use tawin CSS instead of CSS as well as Daisy UI for the components so things like uh the buttons the inputs and the forms my database is mongodb I hear you coming super base developers I don't know why mongodb gets so much hate I absolutely love it I click a button deploy a cluster I have it little string I add it to my code and boom it's working and the cluster is hosted on mongodb Atlas to authenticate users whether it's uh admin users uh who log to their actual dashboard or it's just users who want to provide feedback I'm using NEX oath it's a very simple library that has a bunch of social authentification providers so uh Google Facebook and GitHub for instance and I also always add a login by email so like a magic links and for that I use mail gun to send those emails there are tons of developers who don't really like mail gun I really love it it's super simple to get started and they have pay as you go service so for $1 you'll get 1,000 emails which I think is really fair it took me around 7 days to build the product and this is not very common especially for software Engineers is because I make lots of trade-off first I remove a bunch of features that are not uh essential so there is no way for people to delete their account to retrieve their password or stuff like that and my second trick is that I don't use a bunch of software engineer tools so there is no typescript I ship straight to production I don't use G branches I don't test my code I I make all these trade-offs so I can ship faster I come from a developer background so I used to do stuff very slowly very securely I spent years building apps that made zero to sometimes a couple hundred bucks but nothing crazy but after years getting almost no results I changed my entire mindset and I focus more on shipping fast and having a better copyrighting on my landing page and surprisingly at the same time my Revenue went from not being able to pay the bills to about 50 to 150k per month at the moment because entrepreneurship is about making small bets and you can see the pattern applies to most successful solo prur out there they start to ship one tiny feature of a product and sometimes nothing happens sometimes it takes off and go viral and then at this moment they double down on it and they grow a big company my advice is this try to show the smallest version of your product to the world as fast as you can that's how you gather genuine feedback and know if it's worth or not your time and now that we're talking about one of the most exciting part it's time for a little coffee I usually launch on every platform so product hunt RIT hiker news and Twitter at the same time and the goal is to create some kind of momentum and get as much traffic as I can in about one day but I made a little mistake I normally schedule all my post on Twitter to make sure they go right on time when the product hunt launch starts and one of my good friend was in budy for just a week so I really wanted to see him you might know him already it's tibo maker one of the most prolific Indie hicker out there he's built a Twitter tool that he grew to $600,000 in monthly recurring revenue and he sold it for $9 figures he's an absolutely Legend as he was here for just a week we were having a lunch at the same time as I was launching and during the lunch with tibo one of my close friend Nik called me and said the product hunt link on Twitter is wrong and I didn't know if my computer had nothing with me besides my phone so my friend chibo gave me his computer and together during the launch we fixed the launch all right enough of this here's the launch strategies all right first Twitter is the most important part of my strategy because this is where most of my potential users are and they're also very active on product ton so can help leverage the launch on that platform as well I usually try to make one funnyish video you'll tell me if it's fun or not um where I say that I'm launching the startups and I give the product hunt link so people can see the products through product hunt and hopefully they will leave an up vote when they see the product the reason I'm making these funny launch videos is because first they do well on X at the moment videos X doing well it's kind of weird the second part is because I love making those videos I'm having a good time and I hope people can see that and so my tweet is more likely to perform well now that I have close to 100,000 followers on Twitter it's tempting to think that it's easy for me to launch and it's not easy it's just easyer I started to make those fun launch videos when I had a couple hundred followers on Twitter and back then my tweet would get as many views and many likes as my tweets right now even though I had barely any audience there so even though you don't have a big audience on Twitter right now you can still make a nice interesting tweet for for people to discover your product those fun launch videos were my style and I absolutely love it but you can also be just show behind the scene make a video show your computer screen explain why you build the products if you're a person who make and launch app your life is so cool that there are many things you can share on Twitter you just have to find the right format and find your own signature so as I said before most of the launch strategy relies on product hunt I already made a video on my channel last week to show you exactly how you can get traffic and how you can optimize your product hunt launch you can refer to that and finally I launched on hiker news and on Reddit those are two platform that if you get lucky the post can go viral and can give you a bunch of traffic uh unfortunately this time I was not one of the lucky ones but definitely worth considering all right now let's talk about numbers the product has been on the internet for about 2 days now and there are 7,000 people who visited the site from product hun Twitter Reddit and hiker news 1.5 th000 people sign up for the product which is really big and I also got some really positive feedback especially from Peter levels one of the most prolific Indie maker out there who said the product is amazing and he loves the Simplicity of it yay that makes me so proud I also got the badge the product hunt of the Day badge from product hunt which is a good nice social proof for my website and this is just the beginning I hope that some Media or newsleter will probably check the content of product hunt and I might get more traffic later financially wise I spent $0 and I also made 0 as you've seen there is no pricing on the product is 100% % free for now I'm going to leave it as it is for free and what I'm doing in the reason there is no pricing uh which is very unusual if you've been following me I always uh say that we should add a pay Woll on websites first this is a bit special because I'm not disrupting anything I'm just taking an existing product and I'm making a simpler version of it and I think it's not fair for now to start charging for a simplicity so what I'm trying to do is I'm putting the product in as many hands as I can for free and I see how sticky it is um I'm looking for power users I'm looking for people who will use the product for month and either love it or tell me that it's solving one of their pain and then from that I will be able to know if it's worth opening a paid plan on the product and building more uh features for those users so for now I'm collecting feedback and waiting to see for an opportunity all right that's it for this video if you want to see the other 23 products I made I'll share a link to that video somewhere around here and if you like this video consider subscribing to the channel that really means a lot all right until the next one I hope you just ship it
