I'm renting this car for 4 weeks and it cost about $ 1.5 th000 and if I leave the car in the garage for one month without touching it it's pretty much the same amount of money I lost because of one line of code [Music] all right so I use a stripe for payment for all of my seven tiny internet businesses they take around 5% cut in all the payments and for me that's around $3 to $7,000 per month which is a lot it's actually more expensive than every other business is expensive I have and it's even more than what I spent in marketing and the fees I pay are always different it depends on the credit card I charge it depends on the currency of the payout it's always so different that I usually close my eyes but sometimes for boring accounting stuff I have to export all the strip transactions and that's when I discovered something all right so these are some of the transactions on my account and there is the the fee the strip fee right here and then sometime there is a this line right here that says post payment invoices and usually it's about5 to $15 per day every year there are around 30 million French people go on a holiday during summertime and today I'm one of them now I understand why everybody wants to come here it's so beautiful I don't mind paying a little premium but I kind of want to know where my money goes so I did a little bit of research about those Tri post payment invoices and I realize that stripe charges 4% to generate invoices 1.6 th000 Us doll for a PDF ouch so I went to my strap account to deactivate this option and on the payment link option there's this create an invoice PDF for 4% but it's already already turned off it took me a while to find the culprit but the reason was hidden in my code so since I'm lazy I'm I'm a programmer after all I use GitHub copilot to generate most of my code and so it generated this function here to create a stripe checkout session so that clients can pay but it turned out that this line of code is the reason stripe creates invoices for every customers and the reason I paid 4% for every transactions after I realized it was just money down the drain I was still a little bit curious and I went through the stripe API documentation so I checked for the invoice creation option and it does not say anything about charging 4% for those invoices seriously stripe but in the end I ended up creating a tool for myself to generate those PDF invoices and I turned it into a startup which I called Zenvo and it made way more money than I lost on those PDF invoices so I really believe that profitable cups are born out of frustration enough Fe we love you hey come here you look like a
