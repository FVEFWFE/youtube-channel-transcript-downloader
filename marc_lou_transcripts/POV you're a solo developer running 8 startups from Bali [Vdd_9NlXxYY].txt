================================================================================

backpack this little backpack has eight tiny businesses very small businesses but we can move there anywhere we want are you ready let itce focus is overrated he almost guaranteed to make money wow hello the family just hello so where are we going now we're going to n p uhhuh um my parents decided to visit us in Bali for a couple days wow nice so we're moving the startup office somewhere else to a little Paradise Island it's like 40 minutes away from B it's a little it's actually a pretty big island we have this like very famous place where there's a cliff that looks like a dinosaur and uh you can go down the beach you can have fun it's beautiful they're going to visit that part wow look [Music] you so I'm uh I'm working on this new software I launched it a week ago it's called Data fast and it already has 300 in monthly recurring Revenue as well as 133% of turn rate which is not really good so what I'm doing is I I get each customer's email and I ask them personally with my Gmail account why you stop your membership what is the one feature that's missing in the product that way I hope I'll collect good feedback to make to build a better product as well at eventually new startup ideas honestly it's the boring side of things business owners don't really talk about but I think this has lots of value when you start talking to your customers they see the email of the person who created the product they used and they are usually providing really good feedback and I believe if I keep listening to them eventually I'll land on a million dooll software a day in the life of a solo partner wow this is the dad and this is Mom right here if you ever come to Budd this is a absolutely crazy hike the final step if we're making it to the beach like I think focus is overrated I think I've focused two times in my life and every time I burned out because when you focus on something you put on the time you put on the work you have expectations and then after 3 months if you have no results you just burn out so I never focus on any product unless there's a clear Market feed then I spend all my time on it because I know there's a proof which was a case for chipas on the other side if you don't focus on something and you keep building little bricks here and there you have less expectation for one product and then your head is you zoom out from the product and instead of like making Indie page the perfect link bio for entrepreneurs by adding more features more features more features I'm more like yeah let's tweet about this and tweet about that and then I try new stuff short stuff and then suddenly I didn't have no expectation that it would become a backlink Marketplace it's an interesting conversation so yeah yeah I love I love this conversation people ask you what is the standard of like uh choosing good startup best startup so that people can like uh drop out the best project fast and then move on you know but in the beginning in the page looked like oh this a p obviously you shouldn't really focus for a long time and you should move on but like a late bloomer suddenly people it kind of like a discover the new market by itself and people suddenly find their like own solution from there so it's about timing you know I don't I don't think I think in this Cas in Chast timing is mattered but in this case I don't think timing matters it's more about having my head I Shi the side project it's not a clear here go like no nothing crazy happens I don't ditch it but I don't focus on it I'm working on other products I looking at what's happening in the revenue I looking at what people say I looking at the customer support and then something sometimes at a random moments something clicks like it was the case for the backlinks and then I have so many like man this is this is the same thing for all of my projects even the SEO project I made I shipped like a two month two two years ago like little SEO project and then I moved on and then from time to time I add one page for ranking and then slowly slowly slowly it starts to grow and then after years you start to see things feedback from people like whatever something happens and that is this is just what happening with with indepent so the important thing is don't put the too much High expectation on your actions and then keep it running and eventually and one of the seeds will grow like later exactly it's like planting seeds so that's why sometimes they will just fade and then nothing will happen soil is not good and sometime they will grow very late and sometime they will grow because of another seed you planted later will make it grow and then it feeds by itself on the fairy back home I was checking my phone some YouTube comments and I see this question popping all the time about how to find startup ideas and now it's kind of easy for me to find startup ideas because I have like built 25 websites so problems happen all the times and when there's a problem there's a solution there's a great startup idea but the thing is when I got started I had zero business idea that I could build because I had no problems and I was looking for this creative idea that would be promising and eventually makes money but I I couldn't come up with any but I found the easiest way to come up with an idea that is almost guaranteed to make money there are already existing markets there are existing problems and there are existing solutions for those problems people are already paying for that so the money is already flowing there is no need to come up with a new creative idea sometimes the easiest way is to just replicate something that is already working and make your own version out of it my my 25th startup data FAS is just web analytics nothing special but the market is here people are already paying for these kind of tools so if if you're if you're if you're just getting started and you're looking for an idea to build could be an existing problem find something find something where people are already paying money for and make your own version of what you think the solution should be add your touch add your signature make it playful make it super easy to use add some some stuff that were not there already but make sure you focus on a problem that exists already and that people are already paying for it that makes me think I have tons of work to finish before the week ends and so it's time to go back to work I mean I think this is terrible and it it's applied from anything from lifestyle to business there people who don't want to change and then they feel bad when someone is trying to do a different way I don't like to wear clothes so being topless is weird or I'm learning how to code and there is this software engineer who's been here in the industry for 10 years he telling me you have to use this framework yeah I'm like yeah but this one looks like much no you have to use this like this's this this really sense of like this is the way things should be done and if you don't do that then you're wrong and when you're getting started you don't you have you don't have a confidence so you don't question that and if you do you still feel bad because in the end you you don't have foundation so you're not sure and you easily lose your confidence which is everything at the beginning when you start you need the confidence right cuz that's that's how you keep going where working from home sleeping 9 hours at night I would never believe it because I believed what I saw on social media and somehow by finding this little success and success and success I starting to follow my own way and I realize everything I've seen maybe it works for some others but it doesn't work for me and I wish I knew that earlier so I didn't have to pretend play the game that they've you know set up mhm and that goes for again like uh whatever whether it's like daily habits about sleep and not working too hard or it's about using these special new framework that the JavaScript engineer should all be using it's all [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] man yeah sometimes I wish I would be back in time and and see 21 years old Mark and just tell him come on bro just keep doing what you're doing like don't try to change don't try to please someone don't try to follow someone just keep doing your own way if you have this stupid idea follow it if you don't want to wear t-shirt don't wear t-shirts and who cares who says what he's a good man so my parents are visiting us in Bali and uh since they've been hosting me for 20 years of their life I want to kind of give back and we inviting them to beautiful restaurants hello very beautiful I think I can eat this make a wish what is your wish finished that $1 million I just came back from a delicious lunch with my parents and um I was surprised because my mind was some sometimes thinking about work problems always happen like all the time there are problems at the beginning there are problems when you start to make money there are problem when you make more money I think learning how to deal with problems is very it's it's a very important skill to master if you don't want this like entrepreneur ship thing eating every part of your life that's something I I wish I knew when I started the journey I so I I hope that's a little helpful here um and at the same time one of my other business is making is on track to make $10,000 this month this is crazy because it's running 100% on autopilot it's still early but I will keep you posted in the next video fa cheers
