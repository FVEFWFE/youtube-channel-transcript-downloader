[Applause] [Music] what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is I'm getting a bug that is extremely weird uhhuh and within the last 2 minutes uhhuh we made $400 what yeah I don't know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is going on here we made a 400 buck yeah two customers uhh they both like a very similar time frame uhhuh so this you know there a mix of like punch you in the face and like go [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] yourself like deal you with your bug and at the same times there a liter Universe sending me another message like let me give you 400 bucks oh wow but still [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I don't know I have a bug and I have no clue how to fix it wow that's a nice dish for what the this happens all the time I always blame whatever like I told you like it's a random error I don't know what's going on and Etc then I realize it's it's your fault it's my fault what did you what did you miss it's always the developer fault remember I was making a thumbnail for YouTube video a couple days ago and I put some codes where I kind of reveal API Keys which is secret Keys you're not supposed to reveal that API Keys AP ke and and for that I faked a I created fake API key inside of the project why so I can fake it no so I can fake it so I can make screenshots of fake API keys but the problem is I forget that I saved the file so now my my computer was reading these fake API keys that don't exist so of course he was telling me like hey I cannot connect oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that was fast I'm I'm literally about to launch data fast it's been three months I'm working on that startup um what I'm doing here is I'm testing the happy flow I'm logging with a new browser erase the cookies try a new email address and pretend I'm a new user try everything from visiting the landing page to using the product to being able to pay make sure the happy path is working um once I'm done with that I'm going to press play actually launch that startup I'm not going to lie I'm a bit stressed about it um let's go okay so this is not yet posted on the internet but this is a launch tweet and uh when I click here I officially launch this thre Monon old project [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] the Tweet is live oh my [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it never gets easier it be three years launching 24 websites and I always have this stress whenever I launch I didn't add oh my boy and I don't remember if maybe I it's a website analytic tool and maybe I don't even track my own data oh no okay I'm tracking oh boy okay I I will turn on the camera again if something happens for now it's going to be uh just me overthinking again but at least it's public it's live it's launched I launched it it's been just 1 hour since I launched and there's there's 14 days of free TR so people cannot pay at the moment I got maybe 20 25 signups and two people already secur the launch deal and input their credit cards so the subscription and they are two active subscription this is maybe the road to the first $1 in monthly recuring Revenue with this product let's go that's why [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] I see lots of uh advice for productivity out there and uh most of it I think is really toxic about work hard work hard work hard I've tried that in the past trying to work as much as I can setting up alarms so I can work earlier sometimes neglecting workouts and the only time I burn out like the two times I burn out in my life were times where I neglected sleep and I was not in shape I was not working out every day when I restarted the the Journey 3 years ago I remember made making three rules for myself to make sure that I never burn out again and it's been like a thousand days almost and I've been working every day without taking any holiday and I I always feel great whether it's for work or whether it's my life with with a wife there's no no sense of burnout and I work way less than I used to and I'm way more productive I think working hard Works only if you don't neglect the three important part which are diet sleep and workout and mine is very simple I go to bed at the same time every single day no matter what and make sure I have 8 to 9 hours of sleep and then clean food most of the time and uh not eating too late not eating too much to make sure I don't destroy my sleep and work out every single day no matter what cuz that's the way I tame the little box up there that's how I'm more focused that's how I'm more productive that's how I sleep better and the next days are even easier and I think I work from 10 or 11:00 a.m. until maximum 6:00 p.m. which is pretty decent day but nothing crazy and I'm able to do that every day without sacrificing what matters the most which means having a beautiful Lifetime with with a wife being healthy being happy not being stressed and and really it's all thanks to those three things workout diet and sleep I launched datas my 25th software yesterday and I just got to see the number after a good night of sleep and I was really not expecting any of this to be honest I was really pessimistic about the launch and every time I launch a new product the couple days before the actual launch date I always feel like this is not going to work and sometimes it's the case and sometimes like today it's very surprising I'm going to show you the numbers but just the takeaway and it's always the same but you never know until you actually launch so launch that thing now let me show you some of the numbers Okay so yesterday I made this tweet it's poly written um again the product is a beta of a beta of a beta it's a big product I really launched an early version and um man this like I would never expect to get this much likes and especially the number of comments which show that if you look at the comments it's very positive yeah the overall comments are really positive so that this really shows there's something going on um the numbers are actually great so this now I can use data fast to uh track the data that are happening on my site uh this is data fast you can see the spike coming from the launch uh 5.8 th000 visitors with one tweet this is crazy so now we can look a little bit deeper at what happens exactly so this is the data for just today I'm going to check the last 24 hours so that's a big spike of traffic and that's crazy X or Twitter brought four over 4,000 visitors it's insane um here there are 468 people who went to the signing page that's less than 10% coming from the homepage so here it's telling me that is this is bad this is pretty bad 10 less than 10% interest from click to from visitors to sign up I think this could be really improved uh there's some really potential here to improve it's it's very interesting that H almost the same amount of people are visiting the affiliate page as the one signing for the product so half of the people are here for the actual product which is the reason they click but half of them are also coming for the affiliate program this is this is interesting data and then again from signing to dashboard there's about 30% of people who did not sign up and then half of them did not even create try to create a website W the funnel here is pretty bad um I'm I'm pretty happy with the launch I I I was excited about it because you'll see why later when we come to Revenue data um but it's very interesting to see that the the top of the funnel is actually pretty bad uh let's have a look now at um so this is tripe so of course the product made 0 because because there is a 14 days of free travel but what I do is I let people input their credit card details I charge them the zero until the end of the free trial the 14 days of free trial but by inputting the credit card details they're guarant guaranteed to secure the launch deal because I I cheap with the cheaper price and as I input more features the price will go up in the future and so that nudges people to input their credit card at the moment so they will be grandfather they will keep that launch deal forever and if you look at this those are uh all those are all the people who created an account and input their credit card details to secure the launch deal and they are I think 19 people 19 C 19 potential customers who have an active subscription which is going to start in 14 days most of them are on the 10K plan so that's a $9 a month plan and there are some of them on the 100,000 page views a month which is $19 at the moment I'm recording this video so this data is great the top of the phunnel lots of visitors very few sign up but among the people who sign up which is like somewhere around 150 20 almost 20 of them decided to give the credit card details to secure the launch deal this is really good and on top of that um I checked I bu this little um whatever feedback board for the product where only people who logged in and and have a subscription can submit stuff and I'm already collecting feedback from people so click tracking track events I think um yeah there is something here where uh literally tracking like events um on the website like custom goals like who signs up um and eventually making a funnel out of that I think it's this is the number one feature I'm going to work on after I'm done fixing all the little bugs I've seen and but this is great like this this is the day number one launching this product that's much better than I expected I'm collecting feedback it's going to take a while to get this product to a decent monthly recurring Revenue but I'm positive now I'm positive that it might make more than $100 a month and uh and that's beautiful all right so for today it's mostly there's no plans like I have a lot of like tiny little tasks here and there I'm going to check emails see if I get bugs reports from beta testers um since there have been a lot of people testing V app I was sleeping I expected to have broken at some point so today it's was it's going to be a day just like eating bugs for breakfast this is crazy too this is absolutely crazy so I launched yesterday and within 24 hours the ranking of that new website it's a brand new website no one owned it before it jumped from 0 to 23 that is just crazy and that is at this point it's an unfair Advantage cuz I would never be able to do that but because I built 20 plus websites in the past all of them have a little bit of like domain reputation and so whenever I launch a new startup I add this new domain to the previous domains I owned and it tells Google that the new domain I'm launching is trust trustworthy and so Google will start pushing it up right away and within a couple hours now if I type data fast the name of my new startup Google will rank in first place this is this is really crazy crazy so what I do usually is this this is for instance this is one of my websites and then at the bottom in the footer I had right here the new website and these are all of my other websites so that Google's trust these websites and then he's going to trust the new website that I just that I just created I think when you're getting started it makes sense to have a free project where you research some keywords on Google so you know where to rank like a I don't like a hobby project something you're passionate about that step by step month after month is going to start building a tiny reputation and then later when you launch a new startup you can always add your site to that previous site and you never start again from zero and uh actually I created this art this blog article is 100% free it's how do you get customers with programmatic SEO it's basically how do you create websites that rank on Google using SEO this is for instance an website I built and I I don't touch this website and over time it gets more impression more clicks so Google increase the domain rating and then I can use that website to rank my new websites if you want the article it's it's literally in my blog it's Mark marlb have.com this is where I share everything I've learned in the journey and definitely recommend these kind of like fun hobby projects to get started at the beginning all right about to wrap for today so the 24 hours recap for the launch is 6,000 visitors around 200 signups and 21 people who input their credit card details which I believe is great uh need to fix the top of the funnel I spent most of the day fixing bugs and also replying to customer support because well the app is new it's only be tested by me and three friends so there are some stuff that are not intuitive so people ask questions about how to do this um is it how that should work etc I think tomorrow will be another bug fixing day but now it's 6:30 p.m. I really have to log off because I need to wind down otherwise my brain never stops and I really want to have good sleep that's how I'm going to be able to be productive tomorrow so I'm going to turn off this computer go back see my wife have a little walk maybe outside in the dark alone and uh ready to crush it tomorrow that's all there is to it hey so what did you do you say you make websites yeah okay and you freelance and you work from buy yes okay and you said you started from zero yeah and now how much you're making a month I make like around like 4K this month $4,000 a month yeah that's pretty good buddy it's happening for real so oh yeah for now there is$ in Revenue but if we scroll to the monthly recuring Revenue there it is234 monthly recuring Revenue this this is uh this is just 2 days after the launch and uh there's a 14 days of free trial so people cannot pay for the product but they can inut their credit card so they start their subscription right after the free trial and stri calculate that as monthly recing Revenue already so within 12 day I think this monthly recing Revenue will be converted into actual revenue and there we go just like this the first step of making $1 in monthly recing revenue is completed still a long way to go until I reach a million dollar in valuation but that's that's a that's a little step already so now this is what I am doing in order to hopefully grow this product first I set up a feed back board so this is a little um something I built where only people who are authenticated to my product can submit features and then they are ranked here from the Most Wanted feature at the top to the least wanted feature what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go over each feature step by step the first one the Most Wanted feature first build it ship it let people know that I have shipped that feature and hope that by making a better product uh my people will maybe spread the word love the product and stay for for longer another thing I did and I wish I did that earlier it hurt a lot but it works so well is to ask people blun feedback so I made this tweet a little recap of what happened after the launch and here I asked if you visited the site but did not sign up why be blunt please and this brought so many replies 114 replies and each of them is a masterpiece all of them really really hurts but each of them is a little Pebble to build a successful software so what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to get read these over and over until I understand exactly why people did not sign up why people did not purchase and uh that's it that's the whole marketing strategy I hope I'll find the right problem the right objections until I clicks with the audience and hopefully build a product and hopefully reach that 1 million in valuation now it's same to grind time for no man life is two step dancing with theil trying not to lose my balance but God bless the K now I would say the most important so how was the launch um man you know the numbers is good very happy I think we have around 25 happy users 25 yeah already yeah well that's nice yeah I didn't check today so maybe a little bit more than that so you told me you're going to grow it to 1 million set long journey to go but how we going to actually do it how we going to grow it I mean uh okay so now we around two or 300 in monthly recing Revenue uhhuh 1 million SS is like uh I think 25,000 in monthly recording Revenue okay so that's I kind of have to like add two or zero to that yeah okay I I asked people on Twitter why they don't they sign why they visit the site but why they didn't sign up and I I learned something very interesting yeah so when I asked this question people said I don't understand why I would switch to this new product okay I I realized we ship fast and then my mind forg it yeah and then now I'm launching and I I I didn't pay attention to that yeah I have to find the right angle the right marketing angle what kind ofle see when I launched it fast uh there were already tons of boiler plates out there the thing is shias stood out like there was there was like this boom effect and people are like oh yeah that's night and people spread the world and yet shias is just another Boer plate mhm I think what worked is because I had a really totally new marketing approach like a totally new marketing angle it was not just it was not just a code base to do XYZ it was a tool for you to stop overthinking true and the fact that I branded it with a very emotional thing mhm I think that's the reason to off the reason they visit the site but they don't sign up is because my tool is just another tool it has nothing special it's just analytics it's boring and plus that I am a tiny little company it's just me why would you you know why would you migrate all your data to my software true this is where marketing angle angle come from this is where I have to give people a clear reason why they would sign up something that makes my site very special so that instead of comparing my tool with other tools the my tool would just be a different market like it's like there's no way to compare it with others because it's not like the others so how we going to differentiate you know I cannot say that okay okay we continue but that's a good point but I think it's something to remember for every product that I launch something that anyone who is launching a product should think about why is it different why is it special why someone would share this to their friends is it worth sharing and I think if you can answer that in a single sentence you're onto something M so is it like about more marketing find the angle like oh that's different or you have to really also build the features that is very different man I I I am a strong believer that if you package it in a way that's difference even though the product is not fully ready mhm you're doing a good service for people because you show that maybe there is a solution out there for them and so you can afford to make a product that's not perfect at the beginning it's it's okay because it's finally someone who like oh this guy he has a solution for me if I just make another Analytics tool then what is it like I'm a I'm another funer like there's no I'm making just I'm making people lose their time now if I brand it which I'm going to do I'm going to Rebrand it towards a new thing a new kind of marketing a new kind of analytics then it's worth people time yeah and then if I keep investing my time and I deliver on the promise I'll make hopefully that's the road to this 1 million software even though you don't know the angle fully you can just test in the market early so actually you will get the angle from people not by yourself that is it man oh yeah this is exact perfect Market fit so yeah good question the person behind the camera is an AI hello I'm an AI assistant AI girlfriend that's the new kind of tool no that's the this video I want you watching to think why is your product different and make your entire Ling page could be around that until the next one I hope you keep completely control
