================================================================================

bro stop coding what AI is getting so good they they they say it's going to replace us replace us we've built an entire company just using AI customer support for startup 13 how can I help you today why does everything has to be blue and someone clicked the fishing email we are so screwed we we don't offer refunds I'm sorry we need to change the Border radius here we we we should have used typescript hello boom no no guys we need a meeting right now did AI just turn me into a manager AI is not going to replace us AI is going to make it easier for us to replace everyone else so I'm going to show you in this video how I use AI to code 10x faster first I'm going to show you how I set up my code editor then I am going to show you how I use AI because uh I have built 30 startups using AI 80% of my code is returned by an AI and I also use it for advanced stuff like high level thinking and design and finally I'm going to give you a few tips on how to get the most out of a okay so I use cursor AI as my code editor and that's the only place I do AI stuff I don't use lovable I don't use V I only use cursor I am using the llm clo 3.5 Sunnet at the moment it's really good for every task it's pretty fast I love it and I also have Specific Instructions that I give cursor so in cursor settings cursor settings there is a part that's called rules for AI this is where I instruct the AI exactly how I want it to behave and if for some reason the AI results are not really good then I keep refining the rules for the AI until it trained perfectly on my preferences it is specific for my text tag but if it helps I'm going to copy past this into the description of this video okay now as I said I use AI for absolutely everything from just writing one line of code to having an entire brainstorm about the project architecture and so I've divided this in a few uh categories the first one inline and this is where you press comment K and you can uh write any instruction here I use that usually when I want to do a little fix in C CS so I'm using Tailwind CSS and it's really good at making Tailwind CSS classes from scratch like specific classes another uh feature I really love is when I copy an SVG from an HTML page and I want to turn it into a valid jsx for react uh this is actually just the perfect way to do it I find these uh inline instructions to be faster than the chat so uh whatever it does not need any specific context uh then I will just use this in line instructions all right one of the core feature is the chat so this little thing here that pops up on the right side when you press Comm L I barely use it for coding because I find it kind of boring to always have to all the time uh scroll through the entire stuff apply to uh the code and then check that it was actually added to the code I feel like it's taking time sometimes you make mistakes when it applies the changes so I used the chat mostly for high level thinking um for instance this is one of my uh project where I collect feedback from customers and um the more up votes it gets the higher the post is supposed to go now based on who created the post is it a regular user is it something that was created a long time ago or is it created recently uh there are a bunch of ways to sort those posts not just by uh the actual number of votes but by many other criterias and this is just like a little side project of one of my projects it would take me so much time to come up with a great algorithm so I would use the chat in order to give a few information like hey I want to change how those post are sorted like a don't code but just suggest like the architecture or how we can Implement that I give some of the instructions I want and usually it come up with um sometimes it's not the final results come up with really good ideas and then I mix match this and what I want to apply and then eventually I come up with proper instructions so I can code it later another excellent way to use the chat is to chat with the entire code base we're going to talk about context later uh but things like is there any way to make my API endpoint more secure is there any flaw inside of my API endpoint some sometimes there are days where I create like five or 10 API endpoints and uh it's it could be kind of easy to m one line to check if the user has a proper session or something uh thei is just so good at code reviewing to make sure that I ship my apps with less bugs okay whenever I need the AI to write code for me which is 90% of the case I use the composer uh the composer you can pop it up using command I and then it looks like the chat but it's actually a composer and normally if you see it's a composer there will be written agent here so it's an actual agent uh you can do stuff like uh go on the web and search for documentation but the reason I like it the most is because you don't have to apply the results it's basically like a smart AI that is going to try to apply what you said see if it works and then come back and keep changing until it works as expected so if it needs to create a new file if it needs to install a library you can run your terminal is going to update the files Etc and I just wait do nothing for a few seconds and then he came up with normally something that is pretty good usually the better the instructions I give which I usually get from the chat the better the results I'll get with the composer um I'm shooting this on February 21st 2025 I don't know when this video goes out I don't know what's going to happen with AI but one of my guess is that this will get un better and better it will get so good at some point that it will test itself it will have like a place where you can check if the changes were updated correctly like a sendbox an environment and update the results automatically until it's exactly what the instructions said it should be doing and finally my favorite feature by far is design uh I know there are a bunch of tools out there like versal vzer lovable bolt Etc I don't use any of this because I want my code Editor to design for me because it knows my code base it knows how I name my files it knows my color palette I want cursor to design for me and guess what this is actually possible so what I do when I want a new design um I would go to a popular website and I will pick the components I'm searching so in this case I'm looking for a search bar um I like this little search bar here so I'm just going to take a screenshot of it and then inside of cursor you can just drag and drop the image and you can just ask cursor to recreate this component and make it work with your API endpoint and so this is a very dirty prompt I I really didn't didn't spend time working on this one it was just about this video uh but I actually check it out and it is working if I search for sales so of course the design here is not very beautiful because well I didn't give any instructions but I would normally put it I don't know where somewhere on the top left but it's actually working this is crazy it even have a little effect of like this is just crazy it adapted these components that I found from Material UI to my website so those are my colors those are my borders those are the the the constraint the designs constraint I use for all of my other uh components and so crazy because the agent actually couldn't find everything like it struggled with something and then it fixed itself for some reason and then it created the actual components the API endpoint the CSS animations effect like this is honestly it feels like cheating it's crazy garbage in garbage out as the same goes in AI so here are some tips I use to get the best results with AI first is about naming everything uh actually in programming naming is the hardest thing to do you want your files you want your API input point you want your components to be named in a way that is easy for you and an AI to understand for instance for all of my projects every time I have a react component that is a button that's a physical button then I will name it first button and then the second part will be like for instance if this is button to delete a post is going to be called button delete post then the variables I create inside of the button are also uh very explicit so it's easy to understand that this is a Boolean because it's has is and loading because likely it's going to call an API end points is going to be loading all of my API end points are also explicit so for instance for/ API bu/ search I know that I am going to be searching for p this is really good because it helps the AI come up with better results because it understand your code base more easily tips number two is about the context what information do you give to the AI this is probably the actually the most important because the more context you give the better the results you'll get in my case it's kind of easy because I have built over 30 websites and I always always reuse the exact same code base so my tailin CSS classes are the same my components are all the same my text Act is exactly all the same and I just clone my codebase and then the AI already has foundation so it can easily uh build stuff on top of it and whatever it's going to come up with will be likely a good fit for the actual project if you don't have a code base if you don't have context what I recommend is you is use one of those like a lovable VZ bolt Tools in order to come up with your first initial code base build a project with it and then reuse that every single time for all of your ongoing projects and finally uh the rule of 820 it's again uh February 2025 right now ai is generating about 80% of my coding outputs but I still spend around 20% of my time uh reviewing the code that has been made by the AI and tweaking uh the little details until it gets better there has never been a better time in history to build a sci project now you see you have an AI that can code for you super fast that can help you with like high level architecture design Etc but now ai can also help you with like legal stuff if you need to open a company it can help you with uh gener smart marketing ideas it can help you uh right content for internet it can also help you come up with creative thumbnail like the one you saw and clicked so use AI all the time now you can build a oneperson company with hundreds of AI agents to help you with absolutely everything until the next video I hope you keep shipping this is the thumbnail I was working on yesterday I hope you was worth it
