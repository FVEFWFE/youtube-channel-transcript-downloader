================================================================================

AI is getting so good it's scary I think I wrote less than 10% off the code it's time to go New Zealand wow has finally reached a th000 in monthly recording Revenue yes keep creating keep learning because the future is bright bringing the startup office around the world this is absolutely mindblowing meet Mark Lou a millionaire who owns exactly zero pairs of shoes and way more startups than you'd think is reasonable he sits here in this disgustingly beautiful Tropical Paradise to show you how to turn ideas into Brands strangers into clients and your boring job into a distant [Music] memory okay it's quite early in the morning and I just finished this course by Justin Welsh uh if you don't know him he's very very active on Twitter and Linkedin he has over a million followers on those platforms been inspired by the way he writes on Twitter to write my own tweets and around 2022 2023 after discovering his account and applying what he was doing my Twitter following started to uh grow much faster than it used to be and I got busy and distracted and it took me like more than a year to purchase this course the course is amazing it is exactly what you would expect from Justin Welsh it is perfect if you have any intention to um create anything on the internet and you need to share your thoughts with text the course I bought is called the content OS so it's going to teach you how to come up with a bunch of ideas and how to format those ideas into like a great packaging something that is pleasurable and easy to read and now my problem is that I have so many ideas that I'm going to dedicate an entire 30 minutes time slots per day to writing so check out Justin Welsh course it is really great I will add a link somewhere around this video uh this is not an affiliate program I just really loved the course and I really recommend you to have a look now it's time to write this is such a crazy story I have to show you this okay so this person back here was one of the first beta testers for the course code fast and I remember back then he was asking CHP to build components and trying to piece everything together usually when you do that it's pretty hard to actually build an entire software and I remember when we started uh the beta student part of code fast we went back to the very basic learning the fundamentals of the internet and then the basics like react Tailwind CSS Etc and at the same time back here had a full-time job so he was just studying part-time and he showed up every single day and sometimes it was really hard because learning to code is not the easiest thing to do in the world but he still showed up almost every single day and then somehow with the skills that he earned during the course he was able to build a project and softwares that gave him the opportunity to work for a company as a freelancer to make a project which he was paid $60,000 for that project I think this is a very beautiful lesson about not giving up once and also that sometimes you don't know what is going to happen but if you do something something unexpected positive can happen so just keep creating keep learning because the future is [Laughter] bright 4 minutes 4 minutes okay have your computer my clothes and of course bringing the startup office around the world we're getting a world world tour at the moment that sounds crazy but it is true we are living Bal and uh we're looking for a new home we're doing like house shopping so we're going to start with New Zealand and then we going to go to Japan Korea probably India then we're going to slowly go back to Europe and then hopefully we're going to end the year with Canada USA and South America we have no idea that there's no concrete plan yet we'll go where we treed best we're just going to be slow mads like finding places where you know it's chill we're going to stay a week two weeks sometimes even maybe a month or more if we like it it's time to to good New Zealand hello I'm if you're filming this can you please turn your camera off thank you the is turned off also be careful thank you byebye we made it we freaking made it yeah yeah we were live we finally made it here to Mona New Zealand after a 24 hours long trip we have one our plane that was cancelled so we were moved to the next one and then the plane to come here to the South New Zealand we thought we would almost die in the plane then we had the car rid and everything and anyway we ended up being in this place for 2 weeks so I just finished the morning workouts now it's breakfast time and after that I'm going to go for I don't know four 3 four hours of deep work and then with my wife we're going to visit a little bit what New Zealand is all about and this AI thing is absolutely crazy so I am making a little change log for data so I want to have a Le least of all the previous updates I've shipped somewhere ranked on Google for uh just for backlog maybe even for SE juice and for people who are using the app just to show that the app is being updated recently and consistently I literally ask my AI agents to do all the work for me I use the composer feature on cursor and then I use the mode right here agents and then I describe exactly what I want and then he end up making this change log right here where I have an entire p so it's available at/ Chang log then I have all the previous changes I've made on my app with a date title and a photo the photo is extracted from the video I make to present the new feature and so if I look at the mo the one I shipped in a couple days ago this is marked down so I don't even have to style I just write markdown stuff and then boom I have a a beautiful page I have the demo video right here I have a little promotion that I design also for um well the software itself and at the same time I am using this markdown template on the main main dashboard of data fast to show this little thing right here at the bottom a little uh widget popup that if people click it shows the exact same markdown I have in my change log the crazy part here is that I barely didn't even code this is what's driving me insane these days with AI since I have a code base and I already have some components I just say what I want and it's going to make a beautiful design based on my previous designs and I just write English this is just mad it's crazy I cannot help but think about what is going to be in the future what a developer can do with tools like AI that can code design maybe even do marketing at some points or at least come up with creative angles for marketing that makes the entire process of creating something on the Internet much simpler which is good and bad because at the same time there will be much more competitions I'm just an observer here and this is absolutely mind-blowing if you haven't tried try the cursor agent this is phenomenal after a long day of work there's nothing better than jumping into cold reader how was it it's freezing but it's still good are you going to try no welome to new look at this monkey one two three I was the back fet wow he a human monkey good yeah this is our dream house oh you're very so you're old so cute so so cute love those shitty belly dogs mhm almost each every time they they see you prepare by the way my okay I have a good news and a bad news the good news is that DFAS finally reached a th000 in monthly recurring Revenue yes so this is what the data fast dashboard looks like the revenue overall is up about 10 to 15% month of a month and in terms of monthly recurring Revenue it is now four digits it's growing steadily every month it's pretty slow but it's growing steadily there are now 100 active subscribers so people who have their credit cards and are paying every month to use the service thank you that means a lot at the moment there is about 133% turn rate which is not great but also not bad I think and now it's quite steady so I think the promise I make on The Lending page and what the product delivers is kind of aligned the bad news is that there is some sort of a time bomb in my app um if you can see this is my cluster right here where uh I store all the data the page views and the events Etc uh the dis is already at 150 gab which is uh significant not massive but significant and the thing is the build keeps going up and up and up and up and now it cost me around 60% of the revenue just for the database I will have to find a way to reduce this usage because I might be losing money if I keep having the same structure here I think this is some kind of Advent Mong to be um Tech thing here and I would love to have someone who is an expert eye on it so if that's the case uh there will be a link below this video if you can just apply and uh because I am too much of a developer in my head I collect feedback from my software using this little uh custom made tool where people can up vote and suggest features I added this little thing here to hopefully make the more engagement in the comments people can just uh add likes to replies and that would help me as a business owner know what they exactly want I also changed the algorithm so it gives more priority to post that were made recently with a votes that were made recently as well hopefully it creates some kind of like Dynamic feed of what people want at the moments so I can build the right feature for them it's chicken bro seriously it's chicken ah come here I me you don't pet the chicken I think this is the weakest cat I've ever seen he's like oh this skin is too chewy for me it's so fun okay literally there's no sign of boundaries here yeah the kitchen is there the bathroom is at the bottom of the corridor JavaScript I think I'm going to go for the yellow oh I'll go then what's your favorites this or making YouTube thumbnails this I don't like thinking I I just like doing AI is getting so good it's scary uh this is one of my website ship fast and I have this little uh widget here that is embedded this is not from ship fast it's coming from my web analytics software data fast where I created this entire new uh feature called widget using AI so basically anyone who tracks analytics with datafast will get access to a little uh piece of code that they can embed to any website and it will display like this little cards here that make some of their web analytics public they can uh customize some options like colors light or dark theme uh there are some options and it's crazy that I think I wrote less than 10% of the code I'm using again the cursor AI composer this AI thing is making me so productive as a developer and now I can spend more time on other side that are important like marketing for instance now we are early 2025 I am so curious to what is going to happen in just one year the first Meetup was a month ago 12,000 km away from here and now we're having a new Meetup in Wan New Zealand This truly is a worldwide community and also it's a very tiny town here compared to Paris and still there are eight people who registered and it's going to be one of the most beautiful scenery we've ever had I guess 5 minutes before the Meetup start it's so yeah it's hot this Brian Johnson goes behind the shadow to avoid the skin two minutes ago was trying to look for ice cream shop and now he's like oh no the Sun is going to destroy my screen I have to be careful ah so you changed the travel PL just to Mark drove 2 and 1 half hours from Mountain cook back here to meet you yes oh yeah oh yes you did and NBA in oh also you leave you settle down here now um not quite not quite it's I think it's the biggest ice cream I've ever had crazy freaking mess I really I've never seen this before ever okay it's uh 6 p.m. and this little person here made us do a hike one of the craziest hike you can do in onea it normally takes 6 hours it's 6:20 p.m. it's going to be dark in 3 hours and a half we're going to make 6 hour in 4 hours we're going to do the most insane thing ever yeah right go you're good and another one here we made it for 1 hour 40 minutes wow and we are completely did we we de I know was worth it it's so beautiful yes I can see why they having fun training feels like adenines and good stuff I learned something dur we were doing 16 kilm trkking like it's impossible to do it but we made it so I thought no matter hard work it looks like you just keep going like a focus on your one step two steps and then go straight to the top that's hardest way will definitely bring you the that is one you Robin care morning breakfast a few supplements and a morning tea and best of all a book oh talking of which I just finished this book by Kevin KY he's the author of wired one of the big Us magazine and he also wrote one of my top three favorite book ever called excellent advice of wisdom I wish I knew earlier and I was so interested about the author that I read this one it's about 12 forces like where the technology where new technology like AI Etc internet is going to go which direction is is going to go over the next 50 to 100 years it was written 10 years ago and it's crazy how fast things went and how right he was writing this book a lot of things that he mentioned uh is what's happening now with AI chpt Etc it's an excellent read it's super positive like it's just feel pleasurable and look forward to the future and most importantly it's answering one of the question I get asked most often which is about like all ideas are taken it's too late if you read the book you will realize that actually we are at the very beginning of something much bigger than us and it is the perfect time to start building any business like a tiny little thing on the internet because there are much more things to come in the future things are going to accelerate even faster read the book build something breakfast coding let's go out of mind you like a kiss and have a good time come here rock and roll everything he hey hey
