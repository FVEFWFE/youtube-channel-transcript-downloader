[Music] oh man workout always feel like a burden before I start but it feels so good when I'm done okay so some people asked how do I get feet but the truth is I am lazy I've never been to a gym and I don't have time I have nine tiny businesses to run and so I build a little system for myself that requires the minimum input for the maximum output so here are the eight Fitness rules that transfer my body and uh my workout routine is at the end so rule number one I always g a really good night of sleep there is a part of the brain that is responsible for uh self discipline and decision making and that part regenerate during the night I think it's called the preal cortex like some Andrew ubberman thing but I can tell that if I have 6 hours of sleep I'm going to wake up and everything will feel hard I know I have to work out but I'll struggle to find the motivation and it's going to be so easy for me to just ditch that workout session but on the other side if I sleep 8 hours my motivation my self- will power is much stronger and then I never dit the workout and of course there is this like deep sleep thing where you have all the muscle recovering happening during the night so always try to get 8 hours of sleep this is super important a good place to get started is to always go to bed at the same time my bedtime is 9:00 p.m. and I never uh change that try to sleep in a room that is a little bit cold have a little wind down routine where you don't look at your phone or you don't think about work before going to bed and avoid having heavy meals before going to bed now the rule number two is to always work out in the morning the reason is because there is like the dopamine system that makes us do things in order to get the reward but now with like social media and and uh sugary food and stuff like that we can easily get dopamine for like the really minimal amount of effort and so that workout feels like it's really hard it's a really hard thing to do but the good thing is that when you work out in the morning your brain is like pure because during the night the the brain restores the dopamine level to like a Bas line it's much easier to find motivation early in the morning and whenever I tell myself I'm going to work out someone in the evening because I don't have time right now I always end up not doing it rule number three is to work out every single day I know it seems hard but the truth is you don't need to go to the gym and spend 2 hours what you want to do is you want to start extremely small you can start with 10 push-ups per day you want to do it every single day early in the morning until you start building an identity of a person who works out every single day there's a really good book about that which is atomic habits and this is how you forge a new personality and now because I build this like habit of working out every day it is impossible for me to not work out I wouldn't say I like workout but I am addicted like this is my new personality and if I don't work out I feel bad which then pushes me to do the workout no matter what and so what I started doing is at first I made the workout very small like super tiny so I couldn't say no because it was like 10 minutes and then I started to add a little bit more workout every day when it became too easy more push-up more chin up more ABS Etc rule number four is to know exactly what you want to get I don't care having a bulky physic I don't care having massive biceps I'm not Alex hormozi this is something I do not care about I know exactly what I want I want to be lean I want to be fit I want to be able to jump I want to be super flexible stretchy this is exactly what I want and that is much easier than having a massive body with massive muscles I have picked a goal that I can achieve relatively easily so that I so that I am always satisfied now the mistake number five is that to push extra hard and I see lots of people making that mistake for me I work out a very minimal amount of time 30 to 40 minutes per day but when I am in these workouts I become a beast like there's nothing else that matters outside there's no f there is no distraction I am 100% into the workout and what I try to do is I always try to have an extra rep I try to beat the teacher that's my new game I try to go faster than them like I am 100% committed into the workout so that in the minimum amount of time I invest for that workout I'll get the maximum output rule number six is to find a workout that feels like a play to you I have been struggling with motivation my whole life it started with school because my teachers were boring then I struggled to find pleasure in the in the workouts still but the cure to that is to play and workout is not my playground surfing is so whenever I can I live in Bal I will go for a surf session and dit the workouts because I do something that I like it is so easy to find the motivation to get started it is so easy to push that extra rep because it feels like a play try to find something you like that could be running that could be climbing there many other activities that you can do rather than just doing workout at home rule number seven is to move more of I used to think that um walking and things like low intensity workouts that doesn't make me sweat are useless I studed to understand kind of understand how the body works like how the food is processed and how it's used to consume energy and just simply walking consumes lot of energy it will basically drain the glucose out of the blood use it as energy and then it will consume the fat in order to find more energy and so just walking will make you leaner they say that everywhere that 10,000 step per day is making you healthy I refuse to believe it for so long and now I Chang my mind so every time after a meal I'll will go on the trend meal at home and I would spend 10 to 15 minutes walking fast making at least 1 kilometer so that I Cross My 10K steps because the problem with my work is that I am working on my computer most of the day and uh actually maybe I should make more YouTube videos because at least I get to stand a little bit rule number eight and the final one is eating the right food it's crazy how much it impacts the body shape the first one the most obvious one is that when you eat protein you grow muscles so for that I eat P protein uh in addition to what I eat on a daily basis to make sure I have enough protein and I try to eat at least 1.5 time my weight in protein so I have around 120 gam of protein per day and the second most important effect on the body is that it burns fat uh I'm not a scientist or a doctor uh but roughly what I understand is that first the body when it needs energy it will use the glucose and then it will burn the fat out of the body so technically if you don't overeat you should lower your body fat what I eat on a daily basis could be an entire video but it's roughly this I eat mostly vegetables like I eat tons of vegetables recently I tried an experiment where I cut down completely carbage Foods so bread pizza pasta grains and stuff like that and that had a dramatic impact on my Cravings I used to be hungry all the time across the day and since I remove that and now I eat really really low carbs I don't have cravings anymore I'm not even hungry I eat two meals per day and I just feel lighter not wanting to eat and of course that impacts my body and I'm lovering my body fat and on top of that I don't eat any sugar whatsoever and I don't drink alcohol I eat a few supplements so I have this like collagen peptide this is not a sponsored video by the way this is just literally my collagen peptide I I eat around 10 gr per day I think I feel like it feels good for the ligaments I have way less pain than I used to I actually I don't have any pain anymore um this really changed my life the supplements from Brian Johnson the blueprint stack as I said I also eat a little extra protein from like protein PE protein powder and creatine around five four to five gr per day which same could be an entire video by itself uh also change my life make my brain feel like better sharper and feels like the Muscle Recovery is way faster okay now this is my workout routine I have a base that is around 10 minutes that I do every single day no matter what that includes 20 uh pullup and chinups each 28 80 push-ups I do 40 push-up in a weird position and 40 push-ups in another weird position I always try to rotate what kind of uh push-ups I do I do 125 Russian situps and if possible I will use a dumbbell like a 10 kilo dumbbell on top of that and I finish with a 5 minute plank I put on a music that is around 5 minutes and I try to hold as much as I can the numbers are weird like 20 25 85 whatever is because as I said before I am building tiny habits and whenever I reach level where I'm comfortable I try to add an extra rep an extra rep an extra rep until I get comfortable and of course when I started it was much lower than that I couldn't even do five pull-up chin-up and on top of that I have two Alternatives if the waves are good in B I'll will go surf right away but if the waves are crap like they are at the moment and for the past two weeks I would just do a workout at home there are two types of workout I do mostly it's either calisthenic 30 to 40 minutes of like pure body weight slow movements uh very hard on the muscle but slow movements or I'm going to do interval high-intensity interval training for like 30 minutes while push the cardio to the next level and I tried to rotate a calisthenic a hit a calisthenic and a hit and just recently my wife bought some dumbbells and I started like dumbbell workouts like 10 kgam workout I found all my routines on YouTube I watch Caroline g a famous YouTuber's videos and I just follow along and I try to beat her and final part I don't think this one really impact my body shape but it makes me feel good uh I do 15 minutes of stretching for going to bed there is a huge part on Fitness which is about genetics we all have different metabolisms um so those are my results but my wife started to follow the same routine actually I followed my wife routine more than that she's Asian and she's a female so completely different genetics and the results she's had are crazy I'm super proud of her when we met 7 years ago we both had neglected Fitness for a little while and in the past year or so we've taken Health to the next level and the results she's had are absolutely crazy when I look at her back she look like she has like those almost you could climb on top of it um all because we are following these like rules that uh I just mentioned in the video and then I think I made this entire video in one shot right after workout I didn't eat any single food this morning and it's almost 11:00 a.m. so now it's time for the breakfast and the protein shake do that workout today
