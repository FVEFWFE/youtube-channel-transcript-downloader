================================================================================

in 2021 I was fired from a software engineer job and I decided to go solo and build my own websites today I have built 23 websites from software habit Strikers and AI tools and I do everything myself from the code the design and the marketing I'm going to show you every website that I made as well as the revenue it has generated you'll see that it's very uneven some never made money some made well over five figures and I'm also going to share three of those website that got acquired the first app I built right after I got fired is called mood to movie it's a movie recommendation based on your mood so if you feel like you're sleepy it's probably going to recommend you some action movies you can scroll through them and if for some reason you don't like the movie you can actually hide it and you will not see it again I never tried to monetize this app but the post went quite viral in total since I launched it it got 100,000 visitors one of the reason is because I posted on ION news I had zero audience back then and I made the post there as a nobody and the post went viral and I got I don't know I think about 10,000 visitors from that post and then it started some kind of like viral Loop where some people on Tik Tok would basically get this information and reshare it on other platforms that's probably why we see some spikes in traffic all around here and also I added a little joke it was not really intended but the horny mood it actually got people speak about this they seem like to enjoy the joke and that created some kind of like Word of Mouth organic word of mouth so pretty fun experience overall after m movie I thought of creating a project that potentially could generate Revenue so I'm a big fan of atomic habits the book and I thought what if we combine habits and games and I had this idea of building a habit tracker where you could stick your habits and it's going to grow a little garden a virtual Garden that you can friends can see so this is the landing page a few video demoing the product and it's priced at $9 per month or $54 per year when the users get access to the product they end up on their like a habit page where you can add any habits you want and then you can tick them and you have this habit grid that's going to fill so you see I've have not been really consistent recently and then you have missions so for instance if you show up every day you can open a box and that box will give you some little rewards so that you can plant flowers later in the game and you have a few achievement you have the streck system to gamify everything here is the little garden so you have different kinds of flowers they different Rarity you unlock them as you progress through the game and you can plant them with the gems you collected from the quests and there's also a social part where you can see what your friends are doing but there's a little Board of who's being the most consistent and you can see here I also managed to get 14,000 users on the app the traffic charts looks like this so I started launching the app on March 2022 there has been a few spikes I'll will share which one of those later and the traffic has been pretty consistent with a few thousand visitors per month to launch the product I went on Hacker News for the second time and I got also really lucky the number of points here show that the app went quite viral and that explained the spike in April 2022 where I get 14,000 visitors and thanks to that I also got the first customers for the first time since a long long time it was about 2 years ago since I haven't done any entrepreneurship projects I was really happy and I was so happy that actually my wife and I open a bottle of champagne I'm going to spare you the The Laughing there you go I spent about a year growing this habit tracker I will show you what the revenue looks like so I launched it about April 2022 and then the revenue was not crazy whatsoever it was about hundred few hundred per month at this point I decided to remove the free plan and the revenue really went up and then I stopped working on the app so obviously the revenue went down later and for the monthly recuring Revenue it went to something like $300 per month in recuring Revenue I also built an app IOS and Android app you can find it actually on the store still so it also had some Revenue coming from the stores I think it's about an extra 50% so probably at the peak it was about $500 Mr and because I stopped working on the app the revenue obviously went down and around this time someone on Twitter reached out to me and offered to buy the product that's why the revenue is actually zero right now because we did transition to its own stripe accounts so I ended up selling the Habit tracker to that person for $10,000 so in total it made almost $6,000 in Revenue plus around $2,000 from the IOS and Android store so that's roughly 17 to $18,000 at this point I'm trying to grow my habit tracker but I am a developer and I love creating stuff too much and so I try to find some clever way to do marketing by creating things and came up with books calculator it's basically a mini app that if you tell it how much you want to read every day at which speed for how long you're going to be able to read these many books and it's going to show you some of the books you can read it's basically a way to visualize your habits over the long run and if you curse and you say oh I want some motivation to read more then he's going to do a little promotion for habits Garden I launched the tool on producton Twitter and everything and I don't remember why there was a spike in traffic at the beginning but it happened and then the traffic has been pretty consistent over time and it's now a little bit growing at this point on Twitter I heard some people talking about programmatic SEO and I am totally new to SEO so I was like oh let's try programmatic SEO for this project see if I can learn something and I realized that for books there's some keywords that are easier to rank and so I created all those pages so if you type here for instance I build programmatically all those pages so I think maybe they're like over 300 Pages ranking on Google probably at the moment as you can see here we have one page another page and so I'm basically trying to rank a bunch of URLs on Google and traffic wise in the search console so Google will not let me show you the data before December but I started as zero like any project and there was nothing for a month and then someday at some point Google started to pick my URLs and started to send some traffic to it and it's not crazy but it's driving few dozens of clicks per day and it doesn't look like it's going to stop so it's not making any money but it's bringing some traffic and it's sending the traffic to The Habit tracker the fourth website I buil is called 50 hacks it's a list of the best productivity hack on the internet so anyone can post a new productivity hack like uh I don't know like no phone in the morning or Airplane Mode whatever this is that his is helping you and then anyone as well without an account can like or dislike those posts I try to mimic what's happening on Reddit so there is a Hot Tab where you would basically see the most recent hacks posted that got the most engagement you have the new one where people basically the most recent post and you have the top ones all time and for each of them you can go click it and you can have a conversation with other users on the platform again without an account I launched it on product T and for the first time ever I got a badge and it ended up being second product of the day so I was so happy and that also helped my Twitter account grow a little bit so I started to have a little audience traffic-wise it got a big burst at the very beginning 45,000 visitor on the month of the launch and in total so far 200,000 visitors that's quite a lot because it went viral a little bit everywhere people would restare this on Twitter Tik Tok and everything and and consistently there will be some new people coming onto the platform and so I decided to monetize it with advertisement so at the bottom of each post there will be an ad placement as well as somewhere yeah you can see here this is an ad for instance for actually one of my products dog fooding my own product and at the bottom there is another Banner here that is an ad as well and if I'm not mistaken to promote to advertise on 50 hacks yeah so this is the pay wall to advertise on 50 hack it's connected directly to my analytics dashboard and is going to show you how much traffic you can expect to get on your site and there is a payment link it didn't make a lot of money but it made $350 which is pretty fun for a project like this one some when in the summer of 2022 I was traveling from Indonesia to France and I set myself a stupid challenge of building an entire app within the plane and I commented on Twitter so that I had something to deliver and I managed to deliver a little something it's called body Crush it's a accountability groups for uh friends this is the landing page here and then when you sign up you can join uh groups with people and you can complete your habits and you can see what they completed so you can either create a new group or you can join an existing group so you have groups for uh I don't know people who wants to tweet every day people to want to become game developers Health Group like workout stretch every day and all those kind of like daily habits and when you complete your habit is going to show some little Comet I launched it on product T and to my surprise he also got a badge third product of the day which is amazing for a very tiny product like this one I guess it's because I got so much love from people on Twitter that they helped and pushed the launch a little bit higher traffic-wise nothing as much as the previous apps about 10,000 visitors in total and the app was free and it's still 100% free so no revenue generated for this one then I also built this little game called decision game the ID is if you have two options like you hesitate between let's say a burger and a pizza then when you press Start you have the overthinking monsters that try to eat Kitty and you have to choose one or the other before the monster actually eats the cat and when you press the cat is happy and your score is saved in the database and you can see there are 25,000 people who won the game and 5,000 who let the overthinking Monster eat the cat traffic-wise it was about 32,000 visitors so I launched around here he got decent traffic and then now it's almost to zero every month one of the reason I buil this game was to promote habits Garden my habit tracker shortly after that I realized I already built a bunch of apps that use games in order to achieve real life goals so I decided to create a gamify list it's a directory of gamification app so whether you're trying to learn math JavaScript Finance building habits any app that will used games will appear in here and so I paid someone on um I think it was upwork to gather some information about games so we have the famous duelingo we have my decision game here we have my habit tracker here and also apps like Strava that use some leaderboards and things like that and each app would get a page so for dualingo for instance people can actually leave reviews you would have some information about the app is it free is it not free where you can use it related apps and you can also search apps by categories let's say carrier you can have apps to I don't know do something like team buildings and all that traffic wise we are at a pretty decent traffic I launched but nothing crazy happened but you I'll show you why it's getting consistent traffic with about 30,000 visitors on the app so far it's because um I didn't know it was random but actually I rank for some keywords like for instance you can see basker here there are some keywords that start to rank for those apps and somehow people find the app valuable so Google keep pushing and giving me some more Impressions every month I Tred to capitalize on the traffic and add a monetization on the app so you can promote your own app it will be featured on some different places on the site it's been a few months now and I managed to get zero customers at the end of the year 2022 I started building an app called visualize habit it's basically an extension of books calculator you can pick any habits say how much you going to do per day how many days per week and it's going to show you some nice visuals on what you can achieve over a year and then you can build your little habits card where you can see all the habits you want to pick and some fun things like I don't know if you read 18 books you read for like 3 days and 19 hours in total for instance so let me show you how that works let's say I'm going to build on my habit gried and I want to code I don't know 30 minutes uh three times a week and I want to walk let's say 10 minutes every day and when you press enter then you're going to see your habits gri I call it this way pretty visual there's a way to share your card so you will download the photo and you can send it to any friends it's a little promotion for my habit tracker habits garden and when you click on this link it's going to open automatically the app habit garden and it's going to import all the habits the person wanted to build so there is a little onboarding flow and you can see you can take your new walk habit and then yeah that's typical of morning flow for habit Garden traffic wise it was probably one of the best launch I've ever made the month I launched so it shows the traffic for January but because I launched it I think by the end of the year so that's probably the New Year resolution time that's also helping a lot it went viral on Reddit and other platforms and it got a golden Kitt award from productons and as well as a producton badge you part of it is because I started to make those videos where I would plug myself into a popular movie or a popular podcast and promote my app in my YouTube channel if you want you'll see a bunch of those videos they do usually do pretty well on Twitter because they're pretty new and people were not expecting to see these from a mini startup fer So that obviously brought a lot of traffic to the app and managed to get a bunch of signups for habits Garden I built another habit tracker style I promise this is the last one it's called heroit where basically you pick a workout Avatar and every day when you work out you're going to grow your little Avatar he got the product tant product of the day which I was really really happy with when you sign up you have your this is your dashboard so those are my avatars let's say I surf this morning you can complete and you get a little bit of XP you can also create new avatars by choosing whatever sports that you like save the frequency and then create your avatar there's also a mobile app for hero fits it's available on the app store and on the Android store same as I did for habits Garden it's called capacitor it's a tech that will basically take all my HTML CSS files and put them into a web view that is going to run on any device and So within a few days I had the app live on the stores I actually built this app Live on YouTube if you find somewhere in my channel some of the first streams I did for I think what seven days yeah spent seven days building the product I did it live while I was actually eating some days I would spend 10 hours on the stream and bunch of people from Twitter would come and debug me help me with the design like Manu I remember is the one who helped me me make those acute Avatar things over was a really fun experience and so when I launched on product hunt I managed to get the product of the Day badge thanks to the community of people who actually help and supported the launch and traffic-wise nothing crazy but still pretty decent and for some reason it's still getting some monthly traffic and of course I tried to add a paid plan to add more avatars but I think I made like probably $30 of Sales Early 2023 everybody was talking about Ai and I wanted to build an app that uses CH GPT and I was totally new to AI so I reached out to my friend called Martin and together we built Naval AI it's a little chatbot on messenger and on Telegram and WhatsApp that's using CH pt4 that was trained on naval's tweet Naval ravikant and then inside of your WhatsApp you can ask question to Naval at least what's looks like a version of Naval it's a fairly simple landing page I also made a little funish video about the product where I was actually talking to naal here I was wondering how do become famous like you being a celebrity is no good uh same it's also available in my YouTube channel if you want to have a look at it we disconnected the app cuz it was a little bit pricey and some people were abusing the system and it's not like it was a business we just did this for fun so I think we made a few hundred I don't have access to a stripe account and traffic-wise we had a decent traffic for a tiny app like this one to stay on the naval Trend I built Naval 25 so I pulled 300 quotes from Naval and put them on a little website and they are organized by the most liked one and people can vote for them if they want where you have random Cotes and you have to choose the one you like the most and you have 25 votes this one is pretty nice and then it's going to increase the counters and update the page every day or every 12 hours it's a very simple app I did just for fun and it didn't get much traffic okay so this is the last app I built that did not make money it's called fake it until you make it it's an app that's available on IOS and Android it's a very simple app you can basically send yourself fake payment notification that look like the stripe notifications you would use it either to prank your friends or to motivate yourself to go back and grind and do the work the link page is pretty simple I made a video in The Wolf of Wall Street and this video actually got a bunch of attention and that's the moment where my Twitter account started to grow back then the app was paid I think I made probably two sales actually it made a little bit of money like probably like something like $30 I made the app free now and instead I'm adding a promotion for another product of mine I'm going to show you later at this point I had built over 10 products and I had a little portfolio website for myself where I would show little cards of the things that I built and I got good feedback from people on Twitter so I decided to make it a product and so I built Indie page it's like link tree for entrepreneurs where you can have your own profile descriptions and show all of your startups there about 5,000 solopreneur registered and the profiles are public so this is for instance the profile of Martin you can see his uh Revenue you can see all of his startups link just like you would do on link tree and you have some other cool features like you have some analytics you can personalize your page you can connect a newsletter and it's priced at $25 for one year access or $45 for an entire lifetime deal this is my Indie page dashboard so you see in my profile I can do anything here I can use markdown to update my B right here I can connect my newsletter like substack or beehive and then I can add any startup I want I can drag and drop and reorganize them hide them add some new startups I can also connect them with stripe so that's what I do for all my startup I add a stripe restricted API key to Indie page and it's going to fetch automatically the revenue from stripe so that the revenue is automatically updated every 12 hours and then I can personalize my page so I can change uh the font I can change the colors for instance I can do literally a bunch of things and I have access to some analytics so I can see the total visitors on my Indie page I can see where the peoples are coming from I can see which links they click and few other things like this and finally people can connect their own domain name so it looks like a really a portfolio website I try to make a kind of like a clone of product tant where startups will be displayed on a discovery page and people can upvote those it got some attention but it did not do anything crazy when I launched on producton back then it ended up being product of the day I was really happy I think it was one of my best launch so far and traffic-wise there has been almost 200,000 visitors that's quite a lot it's also because some people share the Indie page to Their audience so it also brings some extra traffic for instance this is my own Indie page and revenue wise this is an old strap account I disconnected it in January so you would add three, ,000 in Revenue to this so it made a little bit above $1,000 with something ranging from 500 to$ 1,200 every month I wanted to play with AI a little bit more so I created Mech Ling it's a website generator using AI so people would type some text and the AI will create a landing page for that query it would add pictures text and buttons the landing page is fairly simple it shows some customers demo as you can see here two features and the price has changed but when I started it was a onetime payment like something $30 per landing page so let me show you the dashboard uh let me pick one website and there are a bunch of features on each of those websites I'm going to show a demo of each of them so this is the website editor by default is going to generate the website and then the customer can do anything they want so uh you can change the text you can add some new buttons you can change where those buttons will go you can change the font the colors the themes there really are many things you can do here you can also add sections so there are few like headers testimonials ctas pricing really a bunch of things here I basically took all the components I built for my previous website and I try to put them in this site and when someone adds a website it will normally I think if I remember well is going to populate create some uh text using CH GPT and sometimes if it's working it should create an an image with AI the customers can also use let's say with typ PCAT they can also use the unsplash library and add anything they want in here so I'm going to remove that section because it's not supposed to be here and the user can preview the website on mobile laptop whatever so that they know what how the page will look like and when they're ready they can actually deploy the site to their own domain name or they can export the code to HTML and there are also a few analytics like how many visitors on the site same I reuse what I use for my other product in the page same components applied here traffic wise it went pretty well it's a trendy AI product so a bunch of visitors over 10,000 visitors per month and revenue wise I started under a different branding it started as lending AI it made about 7,000 us and then I rebranded to make lending later because lending AI was actually used by a big software company and it made another uh 8.6 th000 so in total it was something around 167,000 and Tech wise I was spending about 10% of the profit for open EI credits so for copy generation with chbt and for the image generation using stable diffusion around November December 2023 I realized I was competing against uh big companies like framer uh Squarespace even WordPress like all those website builder and so it was kind of hard to know how to take the product to the next level and I decided to sell the product so I listed it on acquire and within a few weeks the deal was done and made $35,000 in sale from this startup and so in total for Ming I made a little bit over $50,000 I stayed in the AI world and I created work book PDF it's a little platform where you can generate exercises to learn a new language on the topics that you love so let's say you want to learn French and you love food you can create a workbook with exercises all about food so you would get exercises with word related to food as well as some like a food uh cultural facts and interesting things the Ling page looks like this there is a little demo of the workbook so people know what they are purchasing and the pricing it's a day pass so if you access the product for 30day you will pay $30 I they don't want to go for subscriptions because I'm a big fan of no subscription as a customer I don't like subscriptions so I would like to avoid subscriptions if I can and when you get access to one of those PS you can basically generate any workbooks on the student side this is what you will see you can create a workbook where you would pick the language you actually want to learn you would choose the level you're at and you would pick the topic that you're interested in and once the workbook is generated you will have this little page right here where you have exercises where you have to match words some interesting cultural facts complete the sentence find the right missing words and all these kind of grammar vocabulary things you can also download it as a PDF file so that you can print it and do it without a computer traffic-wise it also went pretty well I launched it on AI directory tools and it's still getting consistent traffic but it's not really making much money it made some money during the launch time and then now it's a few dozen dollars per month at this point I was doing the same thing over and over like set up a landing page send emails to customer to confirm their login listen for for stripe events so I can update the user in the database and all that and I decided to make a little boiler plate for myself so I can reuse it for all my projects and I thought why not making it open so that anyone can use it and so I created chip fast it's a codebase for developers to launch their startups faster this is the Ling page here and we have a little demo of the product which is me with a beard explaining what's going on in the boiler plate it's price uh like this at the moment and we have some testimonials here and one of the biggest thing for the spiler plate is that I was a nobody for years like for six years I was no one literally like doing project that nobody wanted to use and seeing that I received hundreds of messages from people who purchased sh fast and that say that it changed their lives it made me just so so so happy yeah enough of me bragging but the testimonials are one of the most precious thing I got from this B plate so it is a codebase so it's available on GitHub and there's also a little documentation that helps the people to get started set up their landing page shut up stripe and all that kind of things there also a bunch of components as I keep making new apps I add new components to the bo plate so it's more complete traffic wise it is probably the app that got the most traffic I've ever had 4,000 visitors in the last 6 months or so maybe 7 months now most is coming from social media so like Twitter and YouTube and also some word of mouth and financially this is the first trap account I had I disconnected it in early January so that's uh a little bit over $200,000 us Genera since the launch plus another $176,000 and something like probably $8,000 collected from other payments like PayPal so in total she F made $380,000 in Revenue had to turn on the lights it's getting dark here I built by dispute it's a little software that helps prevent disputes or chargeback happening on stripe quick backstory when I was working on hadits Garden the first five payments that were made were made with a fraudulent credit card so someone testing a stolen credit card on my site and the payment went through and I was banned like literally banned from stripe overnight and luckily I had a little audience on Twitter back then and I managed to speak with someone who had a deeper look at my account and reinstated it but I was really really scared so this product by dispute aims at reducing chances that you have fraudulent payments in your account I show some examples of you know like if this happened then do that there is also this little component here so some solo entrepreneurs like myself back then have no clue that you could get in trouble for a few disputes on Stripes so but this is what I try to highlight on this page and then I have a few demo of the product and we have the pricing section here where it's basically a pay per transaction the more transaction you protect the cheaper it gets and on the dashboard size this is what it looks like so this is my I actually use that product for all of my other products so you would add a new stripe account by dispute would listen to events on your stripe accounts and based on the rules you set up it will try to prevent some fraudulent actions so you would add new rules like let's say if a credit card was reported stolen then refund the last payment and then there is a little notification tab where this is the actual data that's happening on my account and you can directly go to your stripe account to check the transactions or sometimes even just refund it or send yourself an email or all this kind of like uh prevention traffic wise it's still pretty decent couple thousand visitors during the launch nice and MoneyWise it made $32,000 when I launched it and then as for other accounts I had to swap my account and it made another 700 50 bucks this year so we are almost at $4,000 in revenue for any new product I launch I created one funish video that I would post on social media so either I would go with Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street or I would play World of Warcraft in real life and those videos really helped me Kickstart the journey it would create an initial boost on all my launch and get the first visitors and people on Twitter love the video so I decided to make a mini course so this is the landing page where I'm basically telling my story exactly how it happened with seen here the first video I made with jogan for the product visualized habits that started to Kink things off and then the story as it is today where most of my product actually end up getting a product on badge and even I got some big names in the game that were reaching out to me that say they love the videos so the landing page would show some features like everything that the course is about little hints most of the fun jokes are made with AI I'm actually not a smart guy and another funny guy as well but the AI chpt is really good at crafting jokes and that is what I use to make those videos and I also use AI to create fake backgrounds and create those like a fake characters in the movie The course looks like this so this is the curriculum on the left and on the right there are all the videos where I basically explain everything that I do how to do step by step from the script to shooting yourself editing the movie and also break down some of the videos that I made traffic wise it's doing pretty decent it's also connected to my Twitter so the traffic is coming from there and financially it made 6.7 th000 last year and this year it made 88.7 th000 so a total of about $15,000 the next website is called logas it's a free tool to generate a little icons so for every website I make I always do the same process I take an SVG and I just change the width and add some colors and this is the logo for all my products and I thought why not making it a product itself and so you would go here choose whatever icon you want and then you can change uh the size of the icon you can change the width of uh the borders change the colors everything there are some presets like this like that rounded whatever you want you can also ask AI to make a logo for you so you can describe your business and it will suggest some icons and matching colors and here on the right side there's a little promotion for my sh fast B plate so that hopefully it's paying back the time I invested for this product I launched it on product tun and it was I think my best launch so far so product of the day product of the week and second product of the month as well as a goldon kitty award for 2023 I was so happy I guess it's uh this video who helped a lot where I'm playing with Matthew M people loved it and obviously that spread the word out and the launch went quite viral at the same time when people download their logo right here is going to save those logos in my database and I created a little directory of logos made with logo fast and if you go here you can see for instance a logo made for uh softwares and you can see some of the logos that were made and if you click on some of them you can actually save it on your local browser or you can download it or you can even edit it and then it's going to open Logo fast and let you edit that SV the purpose of this experiment is to rank some pages on Google I tried earlier this year and Google has already ranked over 2,000 pages so if you search for icons for a SAS for instance you might find one of the icons generated with logo fast it didn't make any money directly but thanks to the promotion for ship fast it generated some sales although I didn't trke any of them when I realized I gave stripe over ,000 just to generate PDF invoices I decided to build my own product so I don't have to pay the stripe fee so I created Z invoice this is the Ling page though the typical when you create invoice with stripe for one time payment you can pay up to $1 per invoice and with invoice it's a onetime payment and you can generate as many invoices as you want the current pricing is this way it's a onetime payment of $49 or 69 for unlimited strap accounts and then the customers going end up on their dashboard where they have a unique link that looks like this that they can send to the customers so that the customers can automatically generate their invoices the users can edit the details they want to show on their invoice so they can change your business name the customer support emails their V8 numbers and all that and on the customer side when they send the link to the customers they'll land on this page where they can retrieve invoices or actually they can retrieve any payments made for the business and when they click here they'll get an email that looks like this and when they click on this link they would end up on this page where they can see all the payments they made for the business and they can download their invoice as well as edit a few information if they made a mistake in the name or if they want to change the vat number for instance and financially wise it made a little bit over $4,000 for the past 2 month of running the product and my most recent product is called poop up it's a little pluging that lets your website show some notifications like the one at the top right I created it after Zenvo because people love the notification I even got the attention of gearmo the CEO of versal which was absolutely amazing so this is how the lending page looks like um we have a little demo of the product with some of the features some use cases and the pricing here so it's price one time payment $9 for one website and $19 for unlimited websites the user dashboards looks like this so people would add their website here and then they could click on it and they can customize anything from when to show the message to when should they hide the message and they can also customize the message itself so they can drag and drop to reorganize uh change the text change the icons as they want and at the bottom there is a little script to add to their website for the pop-ups to show up and when it's going to work is going to look like a little bit like this here you go and revenue wise it made three 32,000 since the launch which was like a little bit over a month ago so pretty nice for a tiny product like this one it took me 3 days to create this product I'll link to another video here if you are curious about the tricks I use to build fast there are two more softwares I would like to show you that I created at the very beginning of the journey when I was learning how to code so the past two years or so I was a solo entrepreneur making all those projects I showed you and then prior to that I was working as a software engineer for a company and prior to that I was learning how to code and I created those softwares and the first one I created is called virally Bots it's the Ling page you can see here it's basically a little messenger Facebook Messenger bot to increase escape room businesses conversions so I would work with escap room business where you would go with your friends to solve Clues and puzzles and I would connect a little messenger bot to their Facebook page so it would look like this their users would type on the buttons on their Facebook Messenger app and the bot will automatically replies with a few games you could have puzzles like solve this puzzle here solve that puzzle and they would get some points and when they get enough points they can get a discount coupon for the escape room business I was working with and so my customers would use these fun messenger games to convince their own customers that they are the best escape rooms in town as I was learning how to code this is basically just a lending page there is no user account if they want to get started they would have to email me and I would have to manually go to their Facebook page to connect a messenger bot and I remember taking a course on UD me where the teacher was explaining how to interact with a Facebook API and I just copy pasted what I had deployed a node.js uh server I think he was Heroku back then and it was working and I was just adding some more messages I literally had no real understanding of what was actually going on and so I spent a little bit over a year on this business it's actually how I made my first internet Dollar online so it generated a little bit over $69,000 us I grow to couple thousand per month uh the Mr actually I think reach 4K in the month of December 2019 escap room businesses would pay $200 per month to access product the messenger bot and I had a couple like maybe 20 customers at the same time then covid killed the entire business and then I burned out and I abandoned the business completely and he keept making a little bit of money over the years until the last customer turn really recently this business helped me understand the foundation of programming and I built another software later that would cover the most important part of web development one of the main struggle I had with viral bot is that customers would have to share their messenger but with their customers in order to get results and because of that not all escap from businesses were getting good results with the product so I decided to create a new one called game widget which is basically a similar thing so it's a game but instead of being on Facebook Messenger it's on a website so the code is old so it's hard to show you but they used to be a little widget here at the bottom left that people can click and actually play a game and so when they would click here it will open a pop-up window in the center and they will be able to play this game right here and so it's like a mini escape room within a website so people can go across different rooms and then they have some puzzles to solve so here they would use the key to open the safe to get the lamp they could turn on the light here using the lamp get some stuff and once they're done solving all the puzzles they will get a discount coupon for the business so they can book I launched this product for a very wide Market I didn't Target Escape rooms but like basically any business so I really struggle to get customers I think I get about $50 in monthly recurring Revenue the pricing is set to pay per use so it's $19 per 500 website visitors which is a little bit price but the commer rates were really good and just like what Co happened and my other software went down I also abandoned this business and didn't touch it the product was making about $50 to $80 per month and so last year I decided to try to sell it and I managed to find a buyer so it was exactly 80 Mr so that's pretty almost nothing and the person bought it for $4.3 th000 which is kind of amazing that was the first startup that got Acquired and I was really happy with that all right that's a wrap if you want to check the text I'm using to build all those products I'll link to a video somewhere right here and if you enjoy the video and would like to subscribe to the channel That would really mean a lot until the next video I hope you just ship it
