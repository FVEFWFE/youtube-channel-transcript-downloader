[Music] this is what my current father-in-law told me on the day I married his daughter and that is what it [Applause] means that place that place it it needs a change I spent the last 900 days in this place at 8 hours a day how how much is that 7,200 hours in this place in this office and it doesn't feel like it's mine I want something that Sparks my creativity my my muse or maybe I'm just looking for an excuse to procrastinate first I'm going to get rid of that big black drawer that's full of junk anyway so that I can repaint the the entire white wall from there to there in the same blue color as the left one so that I can stick on all the projects I'm working on right now on the wall just like this that's my portfolio of tardos the problem is I have no clue how to paint my job is this and beside of that I have no clue how to use this in the real world FY buy P luckily I get my friend to help around another all right looking pretty good let's talk about intellectual property in 2023 I was working on an AI startup to help people learn language in a fun way so if you want to learn Korean with K-pop or if you want to learn French with cheese Cuisine then it will generate workbook so that you can practice with your favorite topics it would create a bunch of exercise like this one and make it inside of a workbook so that people can practice their new language no idea what it means the startup was a disaster but along the way I learned that I was doing the same thing over and over from creating Ling page components to authenticating users to sending them email which gave me a good idea because this AI language product was my 15th startups I created a little Cod base for myself so that I can ship startups faster and I turned it into a product so that other developers can use it and I call that ship fast on September 1st 2023 I launched ship fast I was hoping I could make a couple hundred I ended up making a couple hundred th000 and I was so happy it's the first time in 6 years one of my project is taking off and people are happy and pay for it but I wasn't prepared for what came next I share everything I do on Twitter from the apps I code the marketing strategies that I use and the revenue that I earn and sometimes when someone from YouTube who watched my latest video hacked my Ser I also share that when I created my Twitter account 3 years ago I signed up for transparency I'll be as authentic and transparent as possible so when [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fast took off I started to share publicly my revenue and lots of people were inspired with the revenue numbers but among them some of them were a little bit too inspired and ended up making questionable landing pages that really look like mine well let me show you some copycats so this is the homepage of my product and that is my headline I created it because I know EX exactly the pain of building a startup for one year and getting zero users and shortly after came in the copycat inspired websites there was this one with a very similar headline and it became pretty much the default for any new boilerplate product in the end there is only one person to blame if I didn't want to have any copycats maybe I shouldn't Brak my Revenue like this in public but someone went too far original blue new blo I should have known it at least it's dry casual day binging Twitter I received this DM from a friend and as I've seen many CopyCats in the past I I decided to not even look at the Tweet but then I received another DM from a friend with words that are uh quite serious a copyright compliance and going to Twitter I saw other messages like this one lawyers and blah blah blah so I decided to follow the link and look at what is actually going on and I found this Tweet [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fast for $200 now use [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fast instead does the same thing for a shitty S ID clone the repository and a link to a GitHub rep so I followed the link and I ended up on this GitHub repository which is an exact copy of my repository a customer of mine giving away the code for free to the public on the internet I wasn't really sure what to do so I asked everyone in my company well imitation is the sensous form of fluttery and the laziest form of competition it's time to initiate a comprehensive infringement litigation Str have you heard the latest version of next supports partial pre-rendering which combin static and dynamic Pages man the speed I need to upgrade but no one could came up with a proper answer so I decided to ask my friends some came up with questionable advice hi everyone this is niik for Indie news we are on a crime scene today someone just copycatted the famous influencer marlu to create [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] fast so Maru is going to be bankrupt as you can see the cops already present here thank you Nico and some came up with pretty good advice telling me to just talk to him although it didn't go really far so I did what I usually do when I am stuck if you go to that link you actually end up on a place where you can get the code for free for free I mean I think for now it's better to focus on what you like to do in Korea we say so bad thing can be good thing and good thing can be bad thing we will never know focus on what you like Misfortune turns into blessing my wife think that should not obsess over these little details and I should focus on what brought me here as her father told me on the day we got married I think she is probably right so I have decided to not give a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] we are a couple days after the incident and the guy actually removed the repository so my father-in-law was actually right and by the way I'm trying to turn my boring entrepreneur life into a video that hopefully is not boring so please let me know what you think about it
