if you're just getting started with your first online business getting to 10,000 Mr 20,000 Mr or even 83333 Mr if you know you know can seem incredibly overwhelming almost impossible to imagine if you're already on track to hit these goals that's awesome keep doing what you're doing but if you're not maybe you're not even close maybe you haven't made your first dollar online yet then this video is for you if you're just starting out you should focus on hitting your first m Stone of $1,000 monthly recurring revenue and in this video I'll show you four ways that might not be big million dollar s ideas but they will get you to $1,000 Mr much easier and faster than most other approaches let's go let me start by showing you a few popular Indie tools and see if you can spot what these have in common it looks like they're all cutting itch AI tools right well they kind of are but there's a catch it's not easy to see but if you were to open these tools and look under the hood here's roughly what the underlying architecture would look like these tools are what we call rappers and it's the first approach I would consider they basically take existing technology like open AI replicate and 11 laps which are created by some really really smart people then use the API for these tools and wrap it in their own UI so the scope of these tools is really just a front end and don't get me wrong I'm not talking these Founders down they are incredibly good at what they do which is spotting a great business opportunity and then marketing it on social media for profit some of these tools are generating tents even hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly and as more emerging new AI technology pops up I think there's a ton of potential here right now they typically use open AI to R text based SAS products such as chat Bots and content writers they use replicate to run diffusion models used for image generation and they use Luma to create video from text and use 11 labs to create speech and audio but new tools pop up all the time and many of them offer API access from the beginning of course the biggest downside is that these tools aren't cheap so the trade-off from building a rapper is that you'll rely on some other tools that eat a good bite of your margin but then again if you're aiming for a tool that's easy to build easy to maintain and can get you somewhere in the ,000 Mr range fast then I would definitely look into building a rapper instead of building a more complex product the next approach I would consider is something that takes a bit more time to set up initially and in most cases requires a little more technical knowledge however once it's created it has the potential to generate Revenue more or less passively the idea is simple you're going to sell something that saves other people a ton of time so they get to sell what they're building much faster I am of course talking about boiler plates and starter kits and yes I know there are a ton of boiler plates on the market already so why would you build yet another barlar plate because the market is always evolving and even though there are a lot of bar plates out there many of them are either outdated bloated or missing key features for today's Tex stack remember this is heavily tied to preference there's almost always room for another tool even if it's just a slightly different version of something that already already exists some people will prefer yours what I've seen work well is focusing on a specific KNE or Tech trend for example maybe you create a boiler plate specifically for S startups that integrate modern tools like stripe and tailor and CSS out of the box or maybe you focus on something that developers can use as a foundation for their own products like a romate template for an AI powered app that leverages open AI heck you could build a rapper boiler plate that will help people build rappers faster what's great about this approach is that once you've built the boiler plate you can sell it over and over again with very little maintenance and as more people discover your product it essentially becomes a passive income stream the key here is making sure your boiler plate truly solves a problem and is well documented so people can get up and running with minimal friction and boiler plates aren't just for developers either there's an increasing demand for pre-made Design Systems UI kits and no code templates too so if you're more design oriented this could be your opportunity to create a resource that helps the signers or no coders save time and remember you don't need to become the lead boiler plate or dominate this Market in any way to produce $1,000 per month consistently this way okay let's explore something a bit more futuristic this isn't really a fully developed market yet but it's definitely coming up a year ago open AI announced custom gpts and people immediately saw a huge business opportunity here some people even call this the new app store marketplace where you can build custom gbts specialized agents that you can market and sell directly from open ai's platform and it flopped no one's talking about this anymore and I don't think anyone in their right Minds would pay to have access to a custom GPT today mostly because let's face it they suck they don't really do anything different than the normal chat gbg but that doesn't mean the idea itself is bad one of the S products I run is 8base which is an AI powered support tool and one of its primary task is to train AI models on users data what I can tell you is if you're using the right techniques you can absolutely make a custom chatbot really good I have an AI version of myself hosted on my website I call it Simon Ai and I have people talking to it picking my brain every day now mine is totally free to access but I am absolutely convinced that you could charge for a highly specialized AI chatbot like this if you're a lawyer specializing in something specific you could train a custom AI model on your expertise and sell access at a low price if you're a fitness coach with a specific expert domain you could create an AI agent trained on Fitness plans and nutrition advice tailored specifically for people with specific dietary needs if you're a financial adviser with expertise and using specific investment instruments you could create an AI agent that will give advice on exactly this the key here is specialized knowledge chat DBT CLA llama they're all really good but they're very generic I firmly believe that people would pay to access specialized domain level AI agents especially if they're backed by training data on real life experts with the right credentials the only catch is you can't use open AI custom gbts for this they do utterly suck you need to go through the trouble of fine-tuning your models though it's not as hard as you might think and open AI has excellent documentation on how to do this would you like a video where I show you how to do this please leave a comment below and let me know all right let's shift gears when most of us hear monthly recurring Revenue we think about SAS typically when we talk about more traditional service businesses or e-commerce businesses we don't use the term recurring Revenue even though both agencies and e-com businesses are heavily focused on repeat buyers too if you're a freelancer or you run an agency I bet you know exactly what I'm talking about here but in imagine if you could capture these repeat buyers on an actual subscription just like you would on a SAS before your agency instead this is exactly what some small agencies have started doing and it's working surprisingly well you might have heard about popular design agencies like design Jor design me but this could work with any kind of service business like web development marketing social media management and so on and here's the trick to make this model sustainable you have to productize your service so what what does that mean it means turning your service into a packaged offer with clear deliverables that are repeatable instead of Custom Tailoring every project you set boundaries on what you'll provide each month for instance a set number of designs or updates to a website this way the work doesn't pile up and you can serve multiple clients without burning out by prioritizing your services you make it easier for clients to understand exactly what they're paying for and it makes your life way more manageable because you can systemize and streamline the delivery but why would customers want to sign up for a subscription like this in the first place the answer is simple peace of mind and convenience some businesses don't want to be constantly searching for Freelancers or agencies to solve small problems that pop up every month they need ongoing support and they want to know that they have someone reliable to handle it whether it's updating their website creating new graphics or managing their social media presence let's say you charge $500 per month you only need two clients to hit that $1,000 mark four clients at 250 per month you've hit your target now the focus on these four approaches is to get a monthly recurring revenue of $1,000 but none of these ideas are restricted to that in fact most of the examples I brought here is making much more than that so while these ideas are I would say great beginner friendly business ideas there's nothing that prevents you from scaling this into $10,000 or $220,000 Mr if you want me to expand on any of these approaches let me know in the comments and I'll consider turning that into a video on its own if you got value please give this video a like And subscribe to my channel for more
