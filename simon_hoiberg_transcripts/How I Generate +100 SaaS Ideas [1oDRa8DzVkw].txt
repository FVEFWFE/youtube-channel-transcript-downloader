================================================================================

every year I generate hundreds of new SAS ideas I put a dozen of them to the test and I launch at least one so how do I do this well I'm here on the public Street of the internet and I use what we all have publicly available in this video I'll show you the exact framework I use to generate hundreds of potential sass ideas every year first of all if you're new to this channel welcome here I'm Simon and I am what you would call a diversified entrepreneur and one of the ways I've become that is by running a portfolio of small SAS products instead of going all in on one big idea in 2022 I launched my first product feed highp later that year I launched link drip in 2023 I acquired a small tool called tiny kiwi and again later in 2023 I launched eight base these products are all bootstrapped profitable and driving Revenue but how do I succeed every time truth is I don't what you're seeing are the few ones that succeeded behind the scenes I have been dappling with hundreds of sass ideas I've put at least a few dozens to the test and in the end only a few came out on the other side and this is exactly what I recommend that you do don't go all in don't put all your money on red play a safe and diversified game now let me show you the framework I use to generate hundreds of ideas for potential SAS businesses first of all I'm a huge fan of building and already established markets I want to build here on a busy internet street with tons of traffic you don't need to innovate you can simply build an alternative to a tool users already know but build for users who are unsatisfied with the current solution so how do we do that let's go to reddit.com go to the search bar on top and type in alternative 2 then hit enter you're going to see a long list of posts where people ask alternative to Tool now you want to do the following open every item that you find interesting or relevant for every item go explore the website of the tool in question now read the Reddit post and find the reason why the user is looking for an alternative of course not all posts are going to be relevant here some will be old and some will be very far from something you would know or even be interested in trying to solve so we need to filter these a bit for each of these posts ask yourself the following questions is it viable for me to build an alternative be honest with yourself here don't commit to something way over the top stick to topics that you feel somewhat confident about getting into can I address the complaints the user is having again be honest with yourself here sometimes lack of feat featur is there for a reason what the user is asking might simply not be viable to solve now filter all your open tabs based on the above questions hopefully you're left with one or two tabs open still I got one here a my alternative interesting now before we go ahead and start setting up a Myro alternative we might want to have a bit more than a single Reddit comment to base our tool on in case you didn't know G2 is a product review website it's similar to trust pilot but they make a much bigger deal out of verifying the reviewers which makes most reviews more relevant and actionable this is exactly what we need let's head over to g2.com in the search bar let's type in the name of the product we're building an alternative for we can now see all the reviews for this product if we scroll down we'll find a place that says sort by and pick lowest rated that's right we want to find more people who are unsatisfied with this product and we want to know what they dis like so we can explore if building an alternative is an option let's start looking through these reviews even though G2 makes a big deal out of verifying their reviews a lot of reviews are still fairly relevant but once we start looking further we'll find reviews like this one amazing super valuable information here the website gets laggy it's hard to navigate using the interface is difficult and there's no way to revert changes back to a specific point in time these already really good Clues ideally we want to look for reviews that are recent no older than 3 months specific they should address specific pain points actionable they should describe how the user would have wanted it instead the goal is to find at least 5 to 10 additional reviews from people who are struggling with the platform and see if we can find some Comon patterns between them and if they're all mentioning the same issues we might have a potential SAS idea in this case a more lightweight Myro alternative that's easier to use and runs much faster in the browser not bad now let me just make something clear nothing can beat good qualitative research like the thing we're doing right here it's boring and sometimes very tedious work but as the founder you should be doing this that being said a lot have changed on the streets of the internet recently and we would be missing out if we didn't do this last thing let's visit the new building down the street this is where things get really exciting first let's go find a Chrome extension called Go full page this will allow you to take full page screenshots of any website there we go now let's take a screenshot of at least the first three full pages of bad reviews on D2 like that and if you want to you can expand on this step you can go search on trust pilot Capa find Facebook reviews anywhere on the internet where people have something to say about your product at this step we care a little less about the quality of the data we just want a lot of it let's go and upload these images to chat GPT next we're going to use this prompt not going to read it all aloud but I will leave it in the description so you can copy paste let's replace these and there we go now chat gpg will take all of these reviews and output a very detailed business case and finish up with a very specific outline for a SAS idea now combine this with your own research that you did in step two and you might actually have something very cool to work off from here now before you rush into this new idea let me give you a serious piece of advice wait a bit let the idea sit for a bit before making a move create an ocean dog add the idea to an idea database let a week or two pass then revisit it and see if you're still excited about working on it in those two weeks either one of two things will typically happen you'll forget about it and start thinking about something else or your mind will keep going on and on about it if it's one of these ideas you just can't seem to let go of it might be a good candidate to take to the next level and remember you're a diversified entrepreneur even if it's a great idea you still shouldn't bit everything on it you should push this idea forward along with a series of other ideas and for that you need an entire SAS Factory in this video I'll show you exactly how to build a sass Factory step by step go watch that one now see you over there
