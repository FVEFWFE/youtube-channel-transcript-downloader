i was desperately trying to get a passive income stream up and running i wasn't expecting to get rich or anything but you know an income might be able to actually feel and there is just so much useless advice out there either i had to research or understand a tremendous lot like with crypto or nfts or i had to build up a huge stock portfolio with money that i just didn't have so i was looking towards info products it seemed like a perfect fit creating an ebook was definitely something i could work out and people on the internet was clearly making an insane amount of money from this but as it turned out there's a huge problem if you've ever tried selling an info product you're probably very familiar with it when you launch you'll see sales starting to come in but it quickly fizzles out in fact even very successful ebook authors and course creators experienced this after a few weeks sales just more or less stopped coming in i didn't really care about making hundreds of thousands of dollars at launch i just wanted a product that would consistently sell month after month so i was looking towards paid ads this seemed to be the perfect solution for what i was trying to achieve and as it turned out it did not work well not only did my ebook not sell but now i was even losing money but this was where i started to get stubborn about this i thought this was going to be the perfect passive income stream if i could make it work it had to work so i started doing research i played around with the settings of my ass different target audiences i wasted more money i tried a b testing the landing page changed the ad copy still nothing at this point i was super close to giving up when finally and yes the profit margin was the same i finally nailed it a 5 000 monthly passive income stream exactly what i was looking for after digging deep and understanding these results i narrowed down three core elements that actually made my selling system work and here i am in this video ready to share them all with you welcome to my little space here on youtube and thank you so much for jumping into this video i'm simon hoiberg and this is the space i use to share everything i know about making money on the internet so if you're also totally hooked on tech sas business and entrepreneurship or just want to get started making money online then you're in great company here you probably heard people talking about how it's important to build multiple revenue streams and passive income seems to be one of the hardest topics out there the reason why i quote the passive part here is that the idea is being thrown around and misused quite a bit some people use this to make it sound like you can earn money without doing anything in my world you can only obtain truly passive income by investing which i by the way 100 recommend you to do as well but that's a totally different topic in this context it's more about earning money that is not a direct product of your time so you put in some initial time work and effort to build an asset and after that you can make money from this asset without barely spending any time on it so it's that last part i call passive income in this context but i'm just gonna make it super clear that it does not mean that you don't have to put in time and effort to make this work the idea is straightforward you need a product in my case it's my ebooks but it could also be physical products that you sell from drop shipping for instance you need a website you can sell from you can either set one up yourself or use tools like webflow and shopify finally you need to run ads images are super important here so you're gonna need a tool to create some nice visuals i use figment but canva is a super popular choice here since it's easier to get started so users on facebook instagram and youtube will see your ads some will click on it and get directed to your landing page and some will purchase a copy or an item the great thing about this model is that as soon as you nail down something that really works it's easy to turn the knob and volume up sales you want to sell more copies or items you simply increase the ad budget so let's assume that you already have a product in place now let me break down three core elements that makes this system work first one great ads that make people click so let's take a look at how facebook's ad platform works behind the scenes when you're running ads to sell you always want to pick a conversion campaign don't run a campaign for website clicks it won't work nearly as effective in order to run a conversion campaign you need to install the facebook pixel on your landing page and trigger a conversion event every time someone buys your product this event will feed back to facebook and let it know that your goal with running the ad was achieved facebook uses very advanced ai technology and reinforcement learning to narrow in and become better at showing exactly your ad to the right people so it's important that every time facebook sends a visitor to your website you hand them this little bill that they can ring when they do something you want facebook to give you more of that's what the facebook pixel is this is why you don't want to optimize against website clicks and why you don't want to narrow down a specific target audience either trust me facebook is better at figuring out who to sell your product to than you are however well you think you know your target audience so don't narrow by interest age occupation and so on keep a super wide audience and let facebook do its thing this is also why you'll notice that your ads are not performing that well when you launch the campaign it's because facebook needs a bit of time to train the ai will try to make certain assumptions about your ad based on the ad copy the image but really it mostly starts showing the ads to people somewhat at random but by ringing that little bill you'll teach facebook when something worked and it will start figuring out the patterns as a rule of thumb you need 10 to 20 sales to get facebook through training and you can expect to spend at least three times the average price of a sale on ads before seeing any significant results facebook's internal machinery is extremely powerful and once it's tuned in it will start delivering some really good results but it's not a magic platform facebook is really good at getting your ad in front of the right people but you still need to craft a great ad in order to get visitors so here are some things to keep in mind create eye-popping visuals you want something that catches people's attention and makes them stop scrolling the visuals should be vibrant and colorful and shouldn't contain too much text you have around one and a half second to catch people's attention so try to make this test on yourself open your eyes look at the image close them after one and a half second did you manage to get a clear impression of what this ad is about if it's too busy too overloaded or contains too much text the human brain doesn't get a chance to establish an impression in this short amount of time facebook's ad platform allows you to select different images for different placements so make sure you'll have a version that works well on the timeline on stories and in search results generally you want to create three different distinct versions a regular 4x4 a 69 and a 9 16. with these three variants you can adjust your images to work well on all placements also if you're brave make a small video and run this as an ad on reels i've personally had very good results with this though video ads are a bit more advanced and it can't be more difficult to make something that really catches people's attention another version i've seen often is animated visuals in video or gif format so as users scroll by it appears as if your ad is animating into the view this can be a great way to catch people's attention as well lastly you want great copy this is the second most important element of a great ad you want to keep the text short and concise space it out so it's not appearing as a wall of text lists are great to sum up a good deal get personal with your audience don't say we or us if your personal brand use i and me avoid technical terms and buzz words speak in a natural language that people understand use emojis a bit of colors and graphics within the text itself also makes it look more appealing and eye-catching include a clear call to action don't confuse the viewer make it clear what this ad is about what you want the viewer to do and what the outcome is finally and this one is super important include a deal running either a discounted offer or a deal where the buyer gets something extra works really really well it creates incentive you've probably seen people doing this urgency technique where they put only for the next hour and they have this countdown showing on their landing page i would strongly advise against this kind of technique as it comes off scammy on a lot of people instead of rushing people and catering to fomo focus on incentive instead that said running a discounted offer for a time limited period can work well but keep the focus on the amazing product and what they get out of it instead of highlighting how fast people need to move in order to lock it down let's summarize it we need to run conversion campaigns using the facebook pixel and we need to keep the target audience brought so facebook get a lot of leeway to do its thing we need eye popping visuals that make the viewer want to stop scrolling we need great ad copy that sells your product in an easy to read and concise way finally we need to include a deal that creates extra incentive to go and check out your product nailing down the right ad creatives does require a bit of practice and a bit of experimenting with different things and while facebook's ad platform is incredibly affordable this will cost you some money and you should be prepared to throw some money away on simply experimenting and getting it right fortunately facebook's ad platform is a great tool seems like those guys at facebook almost spent more time making that a great experience than facebook itself which i guess kind of makes sense after all that is where money comes from it offers you a lot of ways to quickly create new ads adjust the creatives run a b test create multiple ads under the same ad set to see which one performs better and so on if you want to learn more about running facebook ads please check out ben heath here on youtube he's the ceo of lead guru an advertisement agency and he is a facebook ad specialist alright that was the first one again facebook will only help you get your ad in front of the right people and with a tight ad creative you will now have visitors coming to your landing page so naturally that's the second core element you need to nail down in order to make this selling system work a professional visually appealing landing page that sells obviously this can be done in many different ways though there are some general elements that you should consider including but first of all let me just make it clear that you don't have to be a programmer to set up a great landing page there are a lot of great tools like webflow wix squarespace and even shopify you can use to build something really good in fact even if you are a programmer i suggest you take a look at these tools just to save yourself some time alright let's break down a few things your landing page must have in order to work with your ads yes must have make sure you can check all of these off your landing page must align with the ad if you're selling a specific product make sure that the actual product page is where you direct your visitors if the landing page presents something different from the ad content that's known as a bait and switch and it's against facebook's guidelines ideally the landing page should also follow the same brand colors and design as the ad make it feel familiar as soon as the visitor enters it must be fully functional if the app is crashing half of the time not only will you lose conversions but facebook might actually deactivate your ad altogether so make sure your landing page works is fast to load and is responsive and while we're at responsiveness make sure to optimize for mobile this shouldn't come as a surprise but most of your visitors will come from a mobile phone so besides making sure your landing page is fully responsive make the mobile experience the primary experience make sure it's a great user experience that everything looks really nice lastly make sure you don't have other apps on your landing page like banners from google adsense it's a really poor experience first of all but facebook might actually deactivate your ad if the first thing visitors are met with is another ad they have to click through to get to your landing page so when you design your landing page keep these super important points in mind now let's take a look at some good practices for maximizing the effectiveness of your landing page in combination with the ad your landing page should contain a hero section with a strong headline while you could put the title of your info product or name of the item here it will be a bit of a wasted opportunity since you will present the product including the title and a description a little bit further down on the page what i suggest is a headline that describes the outcome of buying your product preferably using a strong verb at the beginning of the sentence the outcome can be either what you get or how you solve a problem this could be stop wasting money on ads that don't convert or improve your landing page design and start selling more or learn how to build a website from scratch and just below the headline you should have a subheading that briefly sums up what your product is about so a full example could be stop wasting money on ads that don't convert the youtube video that will reveal the truth about realistic money making from running ads if i were to sell this exact youtube video right here the headline and subheading could probably go something like that let's take a few actual examples though here we have robert who's selling a flutter course notice the headline outcome of buying the product introduced by a strong verb robert has a very short subheading here but notice how he's using a video to demonstrate his product which is actually complementary to the subheading this is a great way to further establish trust and demo videos are well known to convert more sales so here we have josh who's selling a css course again he's describing the outcome with one tight sentence here and he's using the super strong verb stop to introduce his headline really well done and joss also uses the subheading to describe what the course is about a little fun fact josh turned over more than five hundred thousand dollars just in pre-sale for this course when it comes to info product he is an absolute elite player let's look at an example here from west boss this website is very different from what you normally see and it very much stands out but again wes boss managed to limit his headline to a two word sentence master gatsby still describes the outcome and still start with a strong verb excellent work and again he's using the subheading to further elaborate on what his course is about last up let me bring in my own landing page as an example here once again you see how i follow the same pattern describing the outcome and starting out with a verb and also here i use the subheading to describe what you will learn from my ebook this right here is one of the ebooks that's making me more than five thousand dollars every month by the way so from here you'll of course spend some of your website real estate to further describe the product outline the content bring out some of the usps from this product obviously you'll also need a place where you can actually click to purchase the product and you'll need a checkout system to handle payment however there are two more things that i believe is an absolute must-have for these kinds of landing pages you need to have an explainer video or a video demonstrating your product as we saw before robot actually added his video as one of the first things to see when you land on his website but you'll notice that jaws got one as well if we scroll a little bit further down we also see that wes boss has won here for his master gatsby course and i got one as well when you scroll down a little further it is well known to increase conversions but it's also a great opportunity to let the visitor get a sense of who you are none of us are celebrities so when a user comes to your website it may very well be the first time they ever hear about you use the video to establish a connection and leave an impression obviously explain what they get from this product and why they should invest in it but use this as an opportunity to let them hear your voice see your face and actually get a sense of who you are as a person you will be amazed how much better your product will sell if you're not just an anonymous person people want to know who you are the next one is testimonials this is absolutely crucial in order to have your product effectively sell ideally you want at least one main testimonial from a person that is well known in the niche you're selling in you can see how jaws got a testimonial from kenneth c dodds who's a well-known author and open source creator himself i got a testimonial from oliver jumpers who's a huge influencer in the tech twitter space and if you look through the first handful of my testimonials you'll actually notice that these people are all highly influential with huge audiences now full disclosure these are my friends and colleagues i talk to them every day and we do business all the time that doesn't mean that their testimonials are not genuine these guys have their own reputation to care about so they wouldn't just say things if it wasn't true but you may not be in a network of creators like this so getting testimonials from these people isn't just something you can just acquire however i want to say two things about that one don't be afraid to reach out to these people even if they don't know who you are a good example mass broad the author of mastering the coding mindset actually reached out to brad traversi who's a huge youtuber with almost 2 million subscribers and asked him for a testimonial they didn't know each other at the time and mass only had a few thousand followers when he launched this book but brad is a super nice and helpful guy and he said yes and mass got a killer testimonial to highlight on his landing page now this doesn't mean that brad is guaranteed to hand out testimonials so please don't go and spam his inbox he's a very busy man and it's likely that you won't get an answer but the point is even if you're in no circles of other creators don't be afraid to try two the testimonials don't have to come from influential people all testimonials are great and as long as you can include an actual name a profile image and preferably a link to a person's social account then they're still good again i will call this a must-have before you launch you need to reach out to at least 5 to 10 people and have them give a testimonial and you need to include this on your landing page alright so now you have amazing ads with awesome ad creators and great copy you have an incredible landing page with a sharp headline a video and a handful of testimonials at this point you can start a campaign and start selling if you carried all of this out you are very likely to have a great start on this business however there's a third element that i want to highlight while it's not strictly mandatory in order to sell it will definitely help you convert more and this is the thing you may not want to hear but here it goes social proof you want to have an active social media presence an engaged audience and great content that relates to your product but that you give out for free when you create an ad on facebook it will run on all of facebook's products including instagram and the ad itself will show as if it's posted from your facebook page or instagram profile so make sure you're active here preferably on both facebook and instagram what happens is that when people see your ad they are very likely to click on your profile to see who you are what people see here can be a determining factor for the success of your campaign will they see a completely empty profile with no posts no followers and no engagement or will they see an active profile tons of great content a lot of followers and a lot of engagement and you in the comments answering people's questions and being super helpful in which of these two scenarios do you think people would be more willing to check out your product even if your ad creatives are great and your landing page is amazing it might very well be that you lose interest immediately simply because you don't have an active profile and yes i know a social presence is not something you can just churn out it takes a long time to build up which is also why you should get started today so if you got intrigued here go and watch my other video where you can learn how i created and launched my first
