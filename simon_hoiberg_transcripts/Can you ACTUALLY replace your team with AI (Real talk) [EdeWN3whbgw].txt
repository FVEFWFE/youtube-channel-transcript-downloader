================================================================================

A recent study from MIT came out and it reveals a brutal reality. 95% of AI initiatives fail to deliver any measurable value. That means only 5% of companies are actually succeeding in replacing human work with AI. So why is everyone hyping this idea that we can replace human work with AI? See, this made me curious cuz I'm one of the few who actually made it work. Over the last year, I reduced my own team from 11 people down to just three. And I replaced their work with AI. And while doing that, revenue went up, our output increased, and margins got better. So, I have to take some blame here cuz I'm one of the people who have been hyping this idea. I have published several videos showing you how to build AI agents, social media content writers, SEO blog writers, and AI support systems. I am actively contributing to this hype. But what I've realized is that replacing your team with AI seems to only work for a very specific type of company run by a very specific type of business owner. And if that's not you, making this move might be a terrible idea. So in this video, I want to take you through three checkpoints. These are filters that will help you answer the question, should I replace my team with AI? and if so, which team members should go first? If you're new to this channel, welcome here. I'm Simon Horberg and my team and I run a SAS portfolio of 5 SAS products. We used to be a small team, but now we're an even smaller team thanks to AI and automation. So, the first checkpoint is all about the DNA of your company. Is your business humanentric or process centric? A human ccentric business is run by people for people. The focus here is on culture, collaboration, and goal alignment. It's the type of company where you want every team member to feel heard. You have a flat structure. You involve everyone in key decision-making, and you spend a lot of time ensuring everyone is motivated and personally aligned with the company mission. Think of a creative agency, a hightouch consultancy, or typical startups where culture fit is just as important as the actual skills. In these environments, the value often comes from the friction and the chaos of human collaboration. If you try to replace this team with AI, you will rip the soul out of your company. AI doesn't care about your mission. It doesn't need to feel heard and it's terrible at nuanced cultural decision-m. On the other hand, we have the process ccentric business. This is a business that runs like a machine. It relies on vicks, guidelines, SOPs, and checklists. Here a team member is assigned a specific task with clearly defined requirements, a deadline and a set of dependencies. Decisions are made at the top by the business owner and the team is there to execute. My business has always been heavily processentric. Even before AI, the biggest selling point I had when hiring was we have no meetings, we have no ceremonies, you can work whenever you want as long as stuff gets done. But the flip side of that is we never really had much culture. I rarely involved the team in big strategic decisions and honestly I didn't require them to be passionate about the vision of the company. My team would care only to the extent they needed to understand the context of their work. And this is one of the reasons I was able to transition to AI so successfully because an AI agent loves a processcentric environment. It loves clear instructions. It loves SOPs. It loves checklists. It doesn't need a pep talk and it doesn't need a zoom meeting to feel included. So look at your business. Are you running a human- ccentric or a process centric company cuz if you are running a high culture human first organization you cannot replace your team. You can augment them but you cannot replace them. If you're running a processcentric company on the other hand you are in a much better position. Let's move on to checkpoint number two. This checkpoint is all about you, the founder. Are you a leader or are you an operator? We're often told that to be a successful CEO, you have to be a great leader. You have to be the person who rallies the troop. The one with the high empathy who makes everyone feel heard, resolve conflicts, and motivates the team to go above and beyond. Think of people like Steven Bartlett, Dan Martell, or Gary Vaynerchuk. These are incredible leaders. Their superpowers are empathy, communication, and culture building. But the idea that you have to be a great leader in order to run a company is not true because on the other side of the spectrum, you have the operator. This is the executive who gets things done. They are obsessed with systems, data, and logic. They are big on systems thinking and often, let's be honest, a little low on soft skills. The ultimate example I can think of is Elon Musk. If you listen to anyone who's worked close to him, they aren't exactly describing him as a great leader, but he is probably the world's best operator. He cares about the physics of the problem, the efficiency of the line, and the output of the system. In fact, usually a great operator is not a great leader and vice versa. This is why natural leaders often hire COOs or project managers to handle the systems and why natural operators often hire team leads to handle the people. And this part requires a bit of self-awareness and introspection. I'll admit I was never a natural-born leader. I consider myself a strong operator. I love building systems. I love optimizing workflows. But I've never enjoyed the people management side of things. the motivation, the conflict resolution, the emotional alignment, all of this. And generally operators like me end up running process-centric businesses while leaders end up running human-centric businesses. And this is the key. If you are an operator, AI is your dream employee. Because AI doesn't need empathy. It needs logic. It doesn't need motivation. It needs instructions. If you're a natural leader who thrives on personal connection, you will struggle to manage an AI workforce because you cannot motivate an AI. You cannot inspire an AI with a vision. You cannot take an AI out for a onetoone to resolve a conflict. So look at these last two checkpoints. If you're a leader running a human-centric business, you can stop watching right now. You should not try to replace your workforce with AI. In fact, you should go watch other videos on leadership and how to become an even better leader cuz that's where the true ROI is for you. But if you're an operator running a processcentric business, you are in the perfect position to replace your team with AI. But even if you have the right business and the right personality, you still can't just fire everyone randomly. You need to know exactly which roles to replace. So let's say you're running a processcentric business and you are an operator at heart. Does that mean you can just fire your whole team tomorrow? No, absolutely not. Because even inside a perfect system, there are certain roles that AI simply cannot touch yet. To figure out which roles you can replace and which ones you need to keep, I use a framework I call the RIP model. Honestly, no pun intended. That is what I call this framework. R stands for repetitive. This is the lowhanging fruit. Is the task identical every single time? Copying data from an email to a spreadsheet, formatting a monthly report, categorizing support tickets. If a human is doing this effectively like a robot, an actual robot will do it better, faster, and cheaper. The P stands for predictable. Is there a clear right or wrong answer? Write an SQL query that pulls active users from the database. There is a correct way to do that. But reply to our biggest enterprise client who is threatening to turn because of a server outage. This is not predictable. AI can write a polite apology, but it can't read the room. It doesn't know the specific client, and it doesn't know that he needs an honest phone call to be saved. AI thrives on formulas. It fails on nuance. But here's the real trap. Most founders do get the R and the P right, but they completely ignore I. I stands for isolated, and this is where 90% of AI implementations fail. Can the task be done in a vacuum or does it require tribal knowledge? I use AI to write code every single day. And AI is incredible at writing clean, highquality code. But AI assumes that your code base makes sense, which let's be honest, most code bases don't. That's why it will randomly refactor code, remove old functions, or delete an unused table in your database. It doesn't know that you have a random Zapier automation set up 2 years ago that reads that specific table in order to run your payroll. This is context. It is tribal knowledge. And AI is terrible at this. It doesn't know the history of your company. It doesn't know the invisible dependencies and it doesn't know why you made a weird decision several years ago. If a task requires deep integration with other moving parts of the business or deep historical context, it's not isolated. And if you try to replace that role with AI, the AI won't just fail. It will probably break things and make a big mess. You can only give AI a task that requires no prior knowledge about a specific thing or where that knowledge can be included in brief terms upon solving the task. So here's the rule. If a role handles tasks that are repetitive, predictable, and isolated, you can replace it today. If it misses even one of these, you have to at the very least loop in a human as a part of that workflow. So instead of thinking about replacing people, think about replacing tasks and apply the RIP model to figure out which ones. This is how you build a system. And this brings us right back to the brutal statistic from MIT. The reason 95% of companies fail to get value from AI is not because the technology isn't ready. It's because they are treating AI like a magic employee that can just figure things out instead of a machine that follows strict instructions. They are trying to replace leadership, tribal knowledge, and strategy with a chatbot. The 5% of us who are actually succeeding, we aren't doing that. We are acting as operators. We are stripping away the repetitive, predictable, isolated tasks and we are handing them over to agents so humans can focus on the things that actually require a pulse. Now understanding the theory is one thing. Actually sitting down and building real AI agents that pass the RIP test is a different story. And if you want to see exactly how that's done step by step, I recorded a full breakdown where I built a news research agent. It creates a perfect isolated workflow that does the work of a human researcher. And you can watch the video right here.
