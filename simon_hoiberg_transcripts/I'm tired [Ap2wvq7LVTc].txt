I'm tired. I'm tired of handing over almost half of my revenue to Meta and Google cuz this is the reality of the business I'm running. I'm heavily dependent on running ads. And of course, it cost money to make money. I completely understand that. But the truth is things have changed. I remember back in 2022, almost 4 years ago now. At this time, VHive, my first startup, was still very new and it was slowly starting to pick up, but I had exhausted the reach I could get from my back then relatively small audience on Twitter. And this was when I discovered how powerful ads can be. Back then, no one was really talking about running ads. But I realized that a good piece of content mostly also works as a good ad creative that can be used to drive sales. So, I started repurposing some of my best viral Twitter posts related to the software I'm selling and ran them as ads on Facebook and it worked really well. At the same time, my YouTube channel was starting to pick up too. But instead of using every opportunity to promote my products in my YouTube videos, I figured why don't I just retarget my own viewers with video ads. then I can focus on sharing value in my videos and when I later hit people with an ad, I will already be a familiar face. And this worked phenomenally. The combination of Facebook and YouTube video ads made FeedHive take off hard in the beginning of 2023, going from around 10,000 MR to 60,000 MR in just that year. At the peak, I would spend 30 to $40,000 per month just on running ads and adding MR. But in 2024, reality hit. My ads just weren't converting that well anymore. Even though I tried to stay on top of the latest trends, recreate the formats, trying UGC ads, and so on and so on, the rorowass, the return on ad spend just kept going down. And in 2025, the whole thing became very clear. Two major movements massively disrupted the performance of her ads. One, YouTube Premium. YouTube dialed up the frequency of inv video ads on their platform to the point it became unbearable and at the same time they were promoting YouTube Premium their adfree experience pretty heavily. So everyone I knew myself included upgraded to YouTube Premium to get rid of the ads and as a result the only people left to see the ads on YouTube would be people with no money essentially. and it was very easy to see my YouTube video ads almost entirely stopped converting two AI slop. Now, I actually don't use Facebook a lot. I only log in to see how my ads perform. But when I do log in, I realize that the feed is now completely infested with AI slop. And I mean, not just AI generated content, but the sloppiest of slop. It's worse on Facebook than on any other platform. And I have a strong feeling that this is just pushing normal people off the platform. Our Facebook ads still perform, but not nearly as well as they used to. And you know what? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. I'm tired of giving these giant tech companies my money. Instead, I would much rather give them to you and help you get your first business going in 2026 or help you add another income stream to your portfolio. So, that's why I'm launching something new. Founder Stack Partners. If you've been watching my videos, you probably already know this, but I bundled my entire SAS portfolio, including FeedHive and four other tools, into one giant stack called Founder Stack. And we're selling access to this stack as a lifetime deal. That means you pay $1,299 once and then you own access to all of our tools forever. And with Foundersstack partners, we are now offering 25% commission if you can bring in a sale. Here's how it works. You go to partners.foundersstack.pro. You sign up for an account and you get a unique partner link. Share this link with your audience, your newsletter readers, your own YouTube viewers, whatever it might be. And for each sale, we will give you 25%. So, for example, you generate 10 sales a month. You earn 25% commission on those sales. We pay you $3,247. Or let's say you generate one sale a day. With 25% commission, that would be $10,67 per month. We have a handful of early partners doing really well on this program already. What we can see on the back end is that on average it requires 600 to 800 visitors to generate one sale. So this does require a bit of traffic, but if you sit on a source that can generate this type of traffic, this is an excellent opportunity. So I'm not going to stop running ads entirely, but honestly, I would much rather move that budget to you. I would rather pay a real human $300 for a genuine recommendation than burn through thousands of dollars just to feed an algorithm that gives me less and less in return. We're keeping the money in the community instead of handing it over to big tech. To me, that is just a much better business model. The system is ready. 25% commission is set. Now, the rest is up to you. Go to partners.founderstack.pro, Pro. Sign up, get your link, and let's see if we can beat the algorithm together. Thank you.
