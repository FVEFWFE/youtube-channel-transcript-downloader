so you want to create a SAS and all you need is a great idea obviously you also need a sales team a customer support team marketing team operations and Business Development security and legal and wait a minute what if I don't want to manage any of this can you still build a SAS just you absolutely these people are called Indie creators and they build so-called micro SAS they do everything themselves and their team consists of one single person the founder itself in this video I'll give you five SAS ideas that you can build as a solo founder including examples from The Real World and we're going to discuss the pros and cons of building this way some of these might not be what you expected let's go the first idea building a tool on top of chat DPT AI is all over the place right now it's the most trending topic of 2023 and it's an obvious opportunity to build a small tool that extends the functionality of chat DBT itself check this out Gatsby has created a version of chat DBT that features a much nicer UI the ability to organize your chats and projects and folders in a library of AI characters ready to use they also have a Chrome extension and a lot of other things super cool a tool similar to this is typing mind which also features a whole lot of extensions to the regular chat DBT interface and here's the interesting part both of these tools require you to bring your own API key from open AI so they're not paying for the AI usage they simply offer a much more convenient and feature-rich interface for their users and I know what you're thinking why would people pay for this if they still have to pay for their own AI usage through open AI well as it turns out people are happy to both Gatsby and typingmind still as lifetime deals and Tony the creative typing mine already made tens of thousands of dollars on this tool and it's literally only a few months old when you pay openai per token through their API it's actually quite cheap so unless you're using AI a lot probably you won't ever spend 20 dollars per month which is the current price of chat EBT plus so for most users there's actually money to be saved here and you get a much more feed to Rich interface so there's your idea bring your own chat gpt-like interface to Market and give it your specific twist and this idea is no code friendly you can totally build an interface like this in a no-code tool like webflow framer or bubble and then consume chat gpt's API directly from the client I think there's still plenty of room in this market and a lot of money to be made so I just got rid of my entire team no people on a payroll no leading and managing anyone I have close to zero responsibilities now and my startup is way less risky for me to run but when I gave up one type of risk I'm now dealing with something else these guys of course I'm referring to platform risk the most realistic way to get a product to Market as a solo founder is to build on top of existing tools and Technologies but we have to face it the trade-off of building these kinds of products is that we're gonna be dependent on other platforms that comes with with risk when rear building on top of chat DBT there's a legitimate chance that openai will roll a similar feature themselves which might render your servers useless in fact in one of my previous videos I'm showing you how to validate a SAS idea and the idea used in this video was an AI prompt designer and there you go this is now a plugin directly available from chat DBT the good news is that if that happens we're just gonna build something new we're one-man team it's much easier to just go with the flow sorry guys you're not coming back alright here's idea number two building a SAS on top of notion notion is an incredible tool users all around the world love using it for note-taking sharing information project management and everything in between in fact notion has become so popular that people started building third-party tools on top of notion and some of them really add a tremendous amount of value on top of an already amazing tool you can use notion forms to create forms in notion you can use Q to schedule tweets from notion you can use feather to publish blog posts from the ocean you can use symbol to create entire websites in notion all of these tools are thriving profitable SAS tools and they're built by Indie creators consisting of one or two person teams there are a ton of opportunities here in fact there's one specific use case I want to share with you my team and I recently moved to notion and we're now using it for almost everything internal weekend documentation change logs issue tickets for our support team project management task for our development team asset library and thumbnail starters for this YouTube channel our content team even use it to plan and write our blog posts directly from notion but there was one thing that turned out to be disappointingly unsupported by notion itself automation which for us resulted in this a lot of cloud functions with custom code that uses Notions API to do Automation and I actually know quite a lot of other teams who end up with this huge spaghetti of sapier and make in order to turn notion into something highly operational so here's the opportunity create an automation Hub specifically for notion design it to look and feel similar to sapier or make and offer a lot of ready-made integration plugins that can be composed to create custom automation workflows for notion I've been looking for this tool myself heck I even considered building it needless to say I would subscribe to this SAS in a second if you consider building this please let me know in the comments I would be happy to join as an early adopter of course building notion tools comes with exactly the same level of risks as we discussed before recently notion added both Ai and their new projects so perhaps you can expect them to also add automation who knows some of us were expecting this already a year ago and nothing really happened so far I think building a tool that hooks up the notion with various other tools is a great micro SAS opportunity now let me just take a second to present the sponsor of this video feedive v-type is an ai-powered social media management tool built by us this is one of the SAS products my team and I run with feed Hive you can do so much more than just schedule your posts we have an integrated AI assistant that will help you write content for social media [Music] built on top of chat DBT but this one is specialized in creating content for social media and it has access to a lot of Insider knowledge that our company has gathered in the past years so not only will it help you write content but it will also give you a performance prediction that indicates how well your post will do and it uses AI to come up with suggestions that will make your post much more likely to go viral we're using open ai's incredibly powerful models for this but we have fine-tuned these models on millions of our own data points so its ability to predict performance is really good I used feed Hive to prepare posts for LinkedIn recently and with a bit of guidance I got this post to a prediction score of 89 and this post completely blew up of course V Dives AI is not a guaranteed win every time but for most people who aren't professional copywriters it's really helpful in getting the delivery just right check out the description below I've included the promo code that will give you 25 off for the entire first year of using feed Hive okay let's take a look at an idea that doesn't require you to build anything on top of an existing tool the catch is it's quite technical so the competitive Advantage is that you're offering to solve a technical issue that's rather complex so this one is for the more experienced software developers an SSL certificate manager let me just give you a quick backstory we're currently building link drip and no code link engagement tool as a part of this tool a user can add their own custom domains to use as a proxy for the links you create with link drip and this part was painful to deal with even I as an experienced software engineer was struggling to get this working smoothly fortunately I'm in a closed Discord group with some really smart people one of them is Oliver jumpers who's a content creator in the tech space and a very experienced software engineer he helped me get this service up and running and I was begging him to make this into a sass but since he didn't want to jump on this one I'm now bringing it to you a service that can handle custom domains and SSL certificates allowing other SAS tools to offer white label and multi-tenant features without having to deal with the technicalities it's pretty Niche but I really think there's a need here and if you're a really hardcore server engineer I don't see why you wouldn't be able to run a service like this as a solo founder so in no way is this one no code friendly but I think there's a great opportunity and I for one would subscribe in a second now let's move on to something less Technical and more oriented about learning here's the idea an Interactive Learning platform for a specific Niche there are already a lot of platforms out there that offer courses some of them have quizzes and some have assignments that you can download though countless Studies have shown that we learn much more effectively by performing an action rather than simply reading or hearing someone explain something so this idea is to use technology to provide learning material in a highly interactive and gamified way for a specific field of work a great example of this is I code this by Florin pop if you want to learn web development you can sign up for I code this and you will get a daily coding challenge that you need to solve you solve the challenge directly inside the tool itself and once you're done you can see how other people sold their challenge you can feature this work on your own profile such as LinkedIn and if you upgrade you get access to learning paths and mentoring by Professionals in a closed Discord group I think there's a ton of potential in this space you can make Interactive Learning platforms for marketing copywriting legal data science really any craft that takes place digitally and if your tool becomes highly reputable you can even consider issuing certificates that verify a certain level of Knowledge and Skills and again this is not building on top of any existing tool and your competitive advantage in a tool like this becomes your expertise and your ability to create Interactive Learning content rather than solving something highly technical alright the last idea and probably my favorite idea of all of these is just on the border of what I would consider micro SAS but it solves a huge problem a low code integration platform so here's the problem every time we as developers need to integrate other services we need to integrate the whole thing from scratch if I want to have Facebook scheduling as a part of my service I'll have to build the integration from scratch if I want to support slack I'll have to build it from scratch if I want to use any service that offers an API I would have to build it from scratch and so is everyone else so you could build a local solution that lets you integrate with various apis on the internet in a simple and standardized way there are tools like Firebase and Super Bass that saw all this for authentication and databases there are tools like stripe that solve this for payments and subscriptions we need a tool that can connect all kinds of third-party services through an elegant standardized low code solution we have tools like sep here make and if this than that that solves this for no code but these tools are not always ideal when we're building our own products a local solution including a single JavaScript SDK I can use to integrate other services easily would be a killer product and yes we are back to building on top of other tools here however we do this in a much more Diversified way since the idea is to offer easy to connect Integrations with a whole bunch of different tools from a platform risk perspective we're in a much better place here than if we build on top of a single tool like notion or chat TPT whether tool like this can be built entirely by a single person perhaps though I admit that this one is on the border on the other hand if you can pull this one off you're sitting on a super powerful product so if you're considering building any of these ideas please let me know in the comments I'm very interested in hearing more about it also I get this question a lot so I want to make something clear in a video like this I include different tools and different people that I believe are great case studies that we can learn from but neither of them paid me anything or compensated me in any way to include them in fact they don't even know that I'm going to include them whenever I do include paid promotions in my videos I always make it very clear that this is in fact a paid promotion so whenever I mention a tool and I don't say that this is a paid promotion or sponsor it's because it's not finally if you got pumped up about this one you should check out these seven AI SAS ideas that you can build 2023 go ahead and watch that one right now also please give it a like And subscribe to my channel for more content I will see you soon
