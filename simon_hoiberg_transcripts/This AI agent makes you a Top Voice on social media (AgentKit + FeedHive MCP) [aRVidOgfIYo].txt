================================================================================

You've seen these people who are always first on a big story, instantly owning the conversation, and you know that's how you build the authority that drives real business. But at this point, it's an exhausting race to keep up. So, what if you had an AI agent to scout the news for you and a second AI, your personal ghostriter, to instantly draft the post in your unique voice? You'd go from hunting for news to simply hitting publish. Your audience would quickly notice you being the first to the conversation every single time. This is the exact system we'll build in this video step by step turning you into a top voice in your industry. Let's dive in. If you're new to this channel, welcome here. I'm Simon Hardburg and I'm building Founder Stack, a collection of five SAS tools specifically built for bootstrap founders. I use social media to drive sales and I know better than most people how powerful a personal brand can be and how big a difference it can make when you build authority with your audience. So I want to have one AI agent that I can chat with and delegate this task to. It should have a chat GPT like interface and based on a quick description it should be able to delegate all other tasks to other AI agents and we should end up with a post that's fully done and ready to publish. So, the only times I'm needed is at the very beginning by describing the topic I want to post about and at the very end by clicking schedule or publish and the post will go out. Let's cook. Openai recently launched their agent builder and their agent kit. And this is exactly what we need. So, let's head over to platform.openai.com. Let's go to the dashboard and let's go to the new agent builder. here. We'll see a few templates we can use, but in this case, we want to create a new one. Now, in order for this to work well, we'll split up this workflow into multiple AI agents with each their own responsibility and access to only the tools they need to do that one job. So, let's set up our first agent. This one is going to be a new scout. Let's give it instructions. The job of this AI agent is to search for news related to whatever the user is asking for and present a list of headlines that we can pick between. There we go. And we also want to add web search as a tool here. Keep it broad and open and make sure the context size is set to medium. Perfect. So now we have one AI agent that will find a handful of news headlines related to whatever topic the user wants to post about. Now let's create another AI agent. We can do that by dragging in another AI agent node here. Let's make sure to connect them. This one will be our news reporter. Let's give it its instructions. Its job is to pick one well suited news headline and further research it and create one news report based on that headline. And we also wanted to find a good image we can use for the post. Perfect. Now let's add another message here. Here we can include the output from the new scout agent. And because we're putting that here, we can disable the include chat history option here. In this way, we'll keep the context nice and clean. And also here, we'll add the web search tool. We'll keep it wide open and have a medium search context size. And because this task requires a bit more thinking, let's set the reasoning effort to medium. There we go. Perfect. We now have two AI agents in place. And just to be safe, let's add a user approval step here. We could remove this later, but I think it's nice to have this step for a while until we battle test the solution. Awesome. Let's test it out. [Music] And we'll see the AI thinking searching for the news and there we go. It will write one wells suited news report, find an image we can use and ask if we want to continue. That's perfect. The first part of our Top Voice news agent is ready. We had the AI search through various topics and pick one news to move forward with. And it created a report and found an image. Now, we need to have another AI agent write a good post about this for social media. And this part is actually much trickier than you'd think. Please, please do not just dump this whole thing into ChatGpt and ask it to write a post for you. It will come out super sloppy. And at this point, the internet is so filled up with bad AI slop already. Trust me, people on the internet can smell AI riding a thousand km away by now. No one's going to read it, and it will make you look super silly and hurt your brand. That doesn't mean you can't have AI ride it, though. But you need to lay the groundwork. This next AI agent needs to learn about your brand, your specific writing style, your tone of voice, and your brand values. It needs to understand you and your brand well enough to write in a way that looks and feels exactly like you would write it if you had done it manually. And this is actually pretty complex. It involves fine-tuning an AI model, creating a comprehensive brand brief, and building a quality assessment loop into your system. If you want to learn how to do this, I have another video where I go through this whole thing step by step. And because this video got so much traction, we actually built this whole thing into one of the products we run called FeedHive. So we have made this whole thing incredibly streamlined by building the whole process into our tool. And we have built a custom MCP server that enables you to set this up with other tools like OpenAI's Agent Builder. I'll leave a link to the other video in the description below. But for now, we're going to continue doing this using FeedHive, and I'll show you just how easy this has become. Let's go to feedhive.com and sign up for an account. The first thing we want to do is add our social accounts. There we go. Now, let's go to the brand profile page. Here, we start by picking a writing style that most closely fits with how we normally write or how we'd like to write. I like this one that's already selected, the vertical writing style. I think this one fits best with LinkedIn. in these days. Then we're going to scroll down to the brand brief section and we'll have AI generate this whole thing for us. So, select your socials here. Feed will look through all of them to get a sense of what your brand is like. I'll also add my personal website here. Awesome. Let's generate it. This might take a few minutes, but we'll let it do its thing. Awesome. We can see now that our AI put together a very comprehensive and detailed and very accurate brand brief based on the information we gave it. Of course, you can edit this at any time you want if there's something missing or something you think the AI didn't exactly get right. I think this one is spot on though, so I'll take it as is. Now, let's quickly test this out. We can go to the compose page here and click this button to create a quick AI post. Awesome. Yeah, this definitely sounds like something I would write. And it used the vertical writing style very well here. Very cool. Now, let's go to the automation page. And let's create a new trigger. I'll call this AI news trigger. And I want to publish for LinkedIn and Twitter. Now, what happens when triggered? Well, we can choose to both create and immediately publish a post. Though again, for now, I just want to see the post myself before going out. So, I'll stick to create draft for now. And we'll write this post with AI. So, let's choose GPT5 from the list. That's it. Let's save and publish this trigger. And this is everything we need from FeedHive. It's now ready to take a request, including a prompt, and it will combine that with your brand brief, your writing style, everything FeedHive now knows about you, and it will turn the whole thing into a post ready post for social media. Now, let's go back to the agent builder. We want to add another node after the approve step, and it should be an agent node, too. Under tools, we're going to add an MCP server. Here we can add mcp.feedhive.com. Let's call this fhmcp server. Now for this part, we need an access token. If we go back to feed hive, we can go to the settings page. Then scroll all the way down until we see the API key section. Let's generate a new key and copy it from here. And if we paste it here, we should be able to connect. Awesome. And we can see our trigger appearing under tools. And if we click here, we can quickly see that it is indeed the AI news trigger we created just before. And because it's an MCP server, OpenAI's agents already know exactly what to do with this tool and how to use it to make a post appear in FeedHive. Now, because we added an approval node previously in the workflow, we don't have to ask for approval to also use this tool. Let's add it here. And that's it. Now, let's call this agent prompt agent. Let's give it a description here. Its job is to create a prompt for feedhive and pass that along with the news report and the image. And here we need to tell it to use the FHMCP server tool. And that's it. Your final workflow should now look something like this. All right, time to test it out. Let's go to the preview mode and give this a prompt. All right. And we can see the new scout is getting to work. Okay. Then the news reporter. All right. So, it's suggesting a news about something with OpenAI making a deal with AMD. Sure, let's take it. Nice. So, the prompt agent is now preparing a prompt. Awesome. and it did a breakdown here about what the prompt consists of. That's it. Now, let's check out the final result in FeedHive. Let's go to posts. Look under the draft section. There it is. Wow. I mean, this is a great news post. And we even have an image of Sam Alman here. Really cool. So, this is great. I'll just go ahead and schedule this for next week. I know a lot of you will probably ask why didn't I use NAD for this and I definitely could have. However, I think for a workflow that starts with a chat conversation like this, I really think this new agent builder from OpenAI is super promising. And if I were to build something more complex, I could have had agent builder delegate to NAD first and then have NAND delegate to feed high. So, it's not really a question of NADN versus agent builder. I actually think they play very well together for more complex workflows. Now, the easiest way to use this agent is to simply click preview like we just did, but personally, I'd like a nice standalone chat interface I can visit in a browser. So, let's just go ahead and publish this workflow. We can get the workflow ID here. Let's head over to Lovable and ask it to cook up an interface real fast. We'll use the OpenAI's chat kit. So, make sure to include the documentation for Lovable to look up. If you're not already familiar with Lovable, it's a tool that will build software using AI. And it's one of my absolute favorite tools. I use it to build internal tools all the time. Now, after a few minutes and maybe a little back and forth, you'll have a chat interface that looks like this. And now, it's available on a website that we can use more easily. There we go. Really a super cool experience working with agent builder, agent kit, and feed hive like this. And right now, you can get lifetime access to FeedHive as well as four other awesome AI tools through our Founders Stack offer. Go to foundersstack.pro and for a single onetime purchase, you can set up this entire system for yourself. With this deal, we'll give you 50,000 AI credits to spend every month, which is enough for hundreds of posts. And if this is not enough, you can always add your own OpenAI API key and remove this limit altogether. all included for a single one-time purchase. If you don't want to use Vehive for this, that's of course totally understandable. In that case, I recommend you watch this video next. Here, I'm breaking down the entire flow, including the things FeedHive does, so you can use this with any social tool you want.
