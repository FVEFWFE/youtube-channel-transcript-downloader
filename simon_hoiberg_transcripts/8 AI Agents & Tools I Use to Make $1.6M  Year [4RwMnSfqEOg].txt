================================================================================

last year my SAS business generated more than $1 million in total revenue and it's on track to do at least 1.5 times more in 20125 but that's not even the most exciting part during last year I managed to increase our profit margin to almost 90% And the way I achieved this was to reduce the size of my team in 2024 we were nine people in total today we only four people left myself included and the reason I could pull this off is pretty pretty simple I replaced my team members with AI and in this video I want to show you the eight most high impact AI tools I use to run my seven figure SAS business and which areas of work they replaced every company is different for a typical SAS business you need to cover four areas of work operations customer support content creation and product development let's get started first of all we need an AI tool we can chat with directly for a long time the only real option was chat GPT from open AI but now we actually have quite a few different Alternatives and they're all becoming really good we have Claud which is now the preferred AI chat for many Founders I know we have deep seek which recently came out and it's giving really impressive results we have Gemini which is Google's version of chat gbt and we have llama which is open source the chat tool I find the most useful overall is still open AI chat GPT though Gemini is actually working really well when it comes to anything related to Maps so if I want to ask AI where I can get something in my local area jimini really does well here the most disappointing tool for me has been clot I subscribed to CLA two times in the last year and both times it was a very underwhelming experience both for coding content and just overall quality of outputs massive downside about chat gbt is that it's becoming really expensive they now have a $200 a month plan and it's just too much to ask in the market with so many good Alternatives so I'm actually using open a eyes models directly with this rapper called typing Minds it's basically a chat UI but connected directly to your open AI account this gives me much more value for the money than paying for chat gbg the next tool on my list is n8n I discovered this tool recently and it is an absolute blast it's an automation tool in the same category as sapier and make but much better you can use it to set up very Advanced automation just like you can do with Sapar and make but nadn allows you to jump into code whenever you need it so if you're a programmer you're getting much more flexibility here in fact you can use naden as a backend prototyping tool since you can set up your own API endpoints easily by using drag and drop it already supports Integrations with a whole lot of tools but one in particular is their AI agents you can connect n8n with your open AI account and create your own team of AI agents drag in an agent Noe add a model add memory now add all the tools the AI agent needs you can now ask this AI agent to perform a task and it will autonomously figure out the best way to use the tool to provide it in combination to carry out your task without having to wire a complex conditional automation flow together totally mind-blowing I'll give you a heads up if you subscribe to my channel which you absolutely should you're probably going to hear me talk a whole lot about this tool I'm not affiliated I'm just absolutely hooked on n8n let's move on and talk about customer support you can definitely set up a custom AI agent a custom rag and have a tool like NN handle customer support for you but if you want something you can set up much faster take a look at 8base 8base is an AI powered support system that comes with everything included you can train an AI model on your own data such as your website PDF files and even YouTube videos and then place a customer support chat directly on your website you can also manage a custom knowledge base directly from a base you can set up the AI to assist you with tickets and emails so it's the perfect mix between a fully autonomous agent-based support system and an email and ticketing system where humans are the first line of support but assisted by Ai and to be fully transparent here 8 Bas is one of the S products my team and I run we're super proud of this product because it is in my opinion one of the best tools on the market right now to carry the heavy load of customer support especially for small and bootstrapped teams but yeah I'm obviously biased if you want to try eight base we have a 7-Day free trial and right now you can actually get lifetime access to eight Bas for a single onetime purchase it's a part of our founder stack offer which includes four powerful SAS Tools in bundled lifetime deal you can go to founder stack. proo and see everything that's included in this offer now let's move on to content creation for all things related to image and video generation I use replicate this is a platform where you can run and fine-tune open source AI models like stable diffusion flux and much more one of the models I use the most is Fox which is considered the best image generation model at this moment it's much better than mid journey and Dolly and with replicate I can use these models directly without having to worry about how they run replicate would take my prompt they'll spin up the GPU instances needed to run the model and give me the output and the coolest part is that you can also fine-tune many of these models directly on replicate I fine-tuned a custom version of flux a so-called Laura model by uploading a bunch of images of my myself and now I can create hyper realistic thumbnails with myself in them using AI all my latest thumbnails here on this channel it's all created by this Laura model you can also create video sound and a whole lot of other things they have a massive catalog of preconfigured models ready to use if you've been watching my videos recently you might have noticed that I'm using a lot of CGI and 3D to enhance the viewer experience and frankly to make the whole process of creating videos much more fun obviously the background behind me is CG even the things on the table in front of me are CG and if you thought I had a whole VFX team working with me or paid some agency to produce these videos I don't blame you in reality I taught myself some very basic blender skills and then I just use AI a whole lot and when basic prompting falls short I use a tool called comfy UI just like replicate this allows you to run open- Source diffusion models but with from the UI you really get fine grain control you can create very custom pipelines and flows using a node-based system this will allow you to pipe the output of one model into another model and use so-called control Nets with depth maps and outlines to guide the output of an image model much better I can even use it to recreate entire environments in 3D by substituting individual parts of very basic 3D scenes I use this a lot for cheap 3D D so because I'm not a 3D artist by any means I can use comy UI to create images that will enhance my very basic blender Clips it gets much more advanced than simply using replicate but you can still use it entirely without having to code you can run comfy UI in the cloud using a tool like run comfy but you can also install it and run it locally another really handy and much more simple tool to create 3D is sey depth I use this a lot in combination with flux soy depth is a simple AI tool that will take an image and predict the depth of the image which can be used to turn a flat 2D image into 3D so I'll basically generate a starting image of the environment I want using flux then I'll upload this to se depth and use AI to create a 3D mesh from this image now I can bring this mesh into after effects and with a few adjustments I have this 3D like environment that I can Us in my scene so this requires no blender no Advanced diffusion model setups just a simple image SE depth and some very basic 3D directly in After Effects and most often people don't really care if it looks perfectly realistic so it's just a fairly low effort way to spice up your videos and have something that stands out from the crowd of course you can argue that all of this is completely un necessary though I think production value matters and I think these tools can help you create content that lead leaves a more memorable impression until everyone starts doing this of course then we'll have to come up with something new the next one is feed hiive which is an AI powered social media management tool I use feed hiive to manage and schedule all my content for social media it covers all the major platforms like LinkedIn YouTube Instagram Tik Tok and many more it has a lot of useful AI tools built into the platform for instance you can access an AI assistant that is fine-tuned for Content directly where you write your posts you can also use V dive to predict how well your post will do and have it give suggestions to edit your post in a way that is likely to get better reach and the coolest part is feed hiive has built-in support for automation so it can be used in an AI agent workflow On Tools like nadn that's exactly how I create most of my content once again full transparency feed diive is another tool my team and I run it's a part of the SAS portfolio that you can get full access to as a part of our founder stack offer so you can get both abase and Feed diive plus two other tools lifetime access for a single onetime purchase I highly recommend that you go check out founder stack. proo again Link in the description finally let's talk about product development one tool I use a lot is cursor cursor is a code editor similar to vs code it ships with a lot lot of AI tooling built into the software and it's a total GameChanger now there are two ways you can use cursor the first one is if you are an experienced software engineer you can use cursor to autocomplete code not only will it finish your sentences but it also predicts where the next change in the code should be and enables you to jump directly to the edit so it's this super cool tap tap tap experience extremely useful for productivity the other one is for people with no coding experience at all cuz you can actually tell cursor what you want in natural language and it will help you put an entire code base together for you I've seen some people do this with both web apps and mobile apps and it's wild to see how people who don't know code code I would argue though that if you don't know code at all you're probably still better off using no code tools where the code is generated behind the scenes using certain restriction and guard rails letting AI code freely for like this without knowing what's going on is probably quickly going to get out of hand AI is here to stay and it will help you run your business in 10x mode if you let it now let me show you step by step how to use nadn and feed hiive to set up an AI agent that will create content for your brand all by itself I'll show you in this video click here to watch it and I will see you over there
