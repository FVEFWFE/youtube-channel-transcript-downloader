================================================================================

for almost two years my S products were stuck no matter what I tried I wasn't able to grow revenue and as more new users were coming in I kept getting knocked down by high acquisition costs expensive ad placements and churn then a few months ago I made a Bald Move one that changed everything in fact it seems like it's turning my entire business around with an increase in revenue of more than 56% so far other Founders told me not to do it cuz this move is a Founders Nightmare and a total game changer at the same time it's just not sustainable it's a race to the bottom don't ever sell your sass on a lifetime a lifetime deal a lifetime a lifetime deal a lifetime deal a lifetime yes I did the thing Founders will tell you to avoid at all cost and in this video I'll explain why most of them got it wrong let's start by outlining some of the most common objections you get against running a lifetime deal on the founder side we get that it's unsustainable you'll get a single payment for infinite ongoing cost to run your servers and to offer support that the audience is problematic we're often told that lifetime users are especially demanding and entitled and that it will hurt your current subscriber base lifetime deal simply cannot coexist with a subscriber base your current subscribers will churn and on the user side we get one major objection and it's all about trust how does the user know that you won't just take their money and shut down your business shortly after and the thing is these are all completely valid concerns there's a reason why so many Founders will warn you to not go down this path and why so many users frown upon this concept but as it turns out there are just three things we need to implement in order to make all of these issues go away now how do I know this let's get into it two months ago my team and I launched Founders deck it's a bundled lifetime offer that will give you access to four tools to handle social media AI support link tracking and Graphics design these are the SAS products my team and I built over the past four years for single onetime purchase you'll get lifetime access to these four tools as well as two new SAS products that we haven't launched yet but will come later this year and this offer has been selling really well but that's actually not the full story one of these products feed hiive was on appsumo back in 2022 appsumo is a Marketplace for Lifetime deals and feed hiive was there for a 2mon long campaign and it was crushing it was among the top five bestselling products in this period it generated more than $300,000 in total revenue and we onboarded more than 5,000 lifetime users later that same year I pre we sold lifetime deals for early adopters of Link drip before we launched that product many of these users are still with us today 3 years later so we happen to have a lot of data and a lot of insight about these users how they use our platform and how the economics around lifetime deals actually work and I think it's safe to say that a lot of the things you hear simply isn't true first of all there's this idea that a lifetime user never CHS how can they it's not like there's a subscription to cancel you took their money now you're stuck with them forever they will be in your support channels grinding your servers eating up AI credits and costing your money for a lifetime what a shortsighted investment into your business but the thing is it's not true lifetime users do turn and they turn for just about the same reason subscribers turn some go out of business and they don't need your tool anymore some outgrow Your solution and they need something bigger some start Outsourcing what your solution did to a third party agency that has its own tool chain and some move on to a shiny new tool that promises to solve their problems in a totally different way and the list goes on the point is that even if a user paid for a lifetime deal you can be certain that eventually they too will turn just like a subscriber will let me show you what I mean here we have two groups of users one group is a mix of yearly and monthly subscribers the other one is a group of people who bought a lifetime deal let's have them raise down this cohort we'll see how long it takes for each of them to drop off as we can see it seems like the lifetime users stick around a little bit longer before they eventually start turning two though seems like someone forgot to start running altogether this is Jonathan Jonathan isn't exactly like other users he he doesn't have an urgent need for your tool right now so he would never become a subscriber but Jonathan has Big Dreams he wants to start his own business and he knows that once he's ready to make the big move these tools will become very useful Jonathan knows how to spot a great deal when he sees it and he considers purchases like these an investment into the future but the problem with Jonathan is that that big day when he's going to make his big move just doesn't seem to ever come so he buys the tools and then he puts them on the Shelf but he never redeems it and he never becomes a user and you would be surprised how many users just like Jonathan will be on your list of buyers Jonathan is an instant Turner from a data perspective he buys and leaves immediately when we account for these types of users our cohort actually changes quite a bit as we can see the average lifetime user actually ends up turning before the average subscriber so no don't worry you're not going to be stuck with your lifetime users Forever at least far from all of them and now that we know that all we need to do is pick a price that's high enough that the average lifetime user won't get to become a losing investment before they turn that's the first thing on the list set a relatively high price point for your offer we're selling founders deack for7 $199 for all four tools for us this is The Sweet Spot it's still a great deal for other users and given our current cost per user we're not going to be in the danger zone of this deal becoming unsustainable anytime soon since we launched founder stack around 230 people have picked up this deal they have generated more than $160,000 in total revenue so the question is how long do you think it take for these people to become a net negative investment for us 2 years 3 years not even close it will take this group of users around 37 years before they will even enter the danger zone of losing US money so yes on paper it's true that if you charge a user once who imposes ongoing costs you will eventually start losing money but most people just wildly exaggerate how narrow this Horizon actually is in 37 years these users won't be using our tool anymore I know it's a lifetime deal but let's be real in 37 years I'll be an old man looking back at life even if some of these users are still using feed diive it's at least not going to be my problem by that time but there's an important point to be made here the reason this timeline is so long is partially because we're charging a high price but it's also because we're good at keeping our cost low which is the second thing on our list if you can price reasonably high and at the same time keep a very tight cost control when operating your business you're safe this means selling simple but specialized tools they should be fully self-served and the need for support should be super low no demo calls no presentations and sales meetings no manual onboarding no designated customer success agents or account managers none of that it's way too expensive keep your products low touch and selfs serve make a big deal out of the product onboarding experience and have a lot of guides tutorials and videos ready so the user can help themselves effectively if you're pricing too low and your product cost too much to run this is where you get into trouble so when you plan for this make safe conservative estimates finally one big concern people have is the impact a lifetime deal will have on their current subscriber base base in our case we lost 10 subscribers these users canceled their subscription and replaced it with founder stack which means that only around 4.5% of our founder stack buyers are current subscribers but here's where it gets interesting we can track at least 15 new subscribers who originally found us through the founder stack website so even though Founders stack did cause some subscribers to leave it has still netted us five new subscribers I can't explain this conclusively but my theory is that this again has to do with the high price point for instance a lot of our users are on a $29 a month feed diive plan and they're set they don't need eight Bas link driven tiny Qi and $799 is quite a lot compared to the $29 a month they're currently paying even if it's a one-time purchase and the other one is recurring and as for the new subscribers I'm guessing that some of them might just want to try out the tools for a few months before buying founder stack or they heard about our tools through the founder stack promotion but again only needed one of them I'm not entirely sure here but my clear impression is that if the price distance is big enough you probably don't have to worry that your entire subscriber base is jumping this ship grabbing your lifetime deal all at once now there's one last thing we need to talk about and that's trust unfortunately deal sites like EP suumo pitch ground and deal mirror have made it a little too tempting for certain Bad actors to exploit the lifetime deal business model there have been cases where Founders do the LTD version of a pump and dump they list their tool on appsumo and then they hype up their road map and make some insane promises about what's coming and what the lifetime users will get they grab the cash and then they close down 3 months later and say oops we went bankrupt startup is hard everyone knows the risk so on and so on obviously super shady and then there are more well-intended founders who just get way ahead of themselves they'll sell a lifetime deal for $39 which uses AI extensively and has a super high cost and as we've already discovered that's a safe way to actually go bankrupt in a short time and yes this has happened many times so a lot of LCD buyers have become a bit skeptical there's only one way to get around this issue and it's the last thing on our list we need to prioritize building a strong reputation you as the founder should be the public face of your company you should be on social media on YouTube and people's emails building trust you should demonstrate that you are a responsible person that you're not just going to run this company into the ground just like that and that you will to the best of your ability give your users what you promis them if you're hiding behind your company if you're invisible if people can't reach you it's going to be hard if not impossible to sell your products this way whether a lifetime deal or traditional subscriptions are best for your business only you can tell but before you blindly reject the idea of a lifetime deal I think you at least owe it to yourself to entertain the thought just make sure you have these three things covered thanks for watching
