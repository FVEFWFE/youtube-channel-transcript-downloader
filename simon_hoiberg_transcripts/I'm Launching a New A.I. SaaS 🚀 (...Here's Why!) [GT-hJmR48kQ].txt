================================================================================

the support emails were pouring in way faster than I could possibly manage to keep up and it just didn't seem to stop I desperately needed to come up with a solution fast let's start from the beginning Twitter had just introduced their new API prices and we had sent out an announcement explaining that our products would discontinue the integration within a few hours our live chats were on fire and not in a good way we had a lot of angry users and a lot of understanding users but with a ton of questions at this time I had three people on chat support trying their best to keep up with the constant flow of new messages it was excruciating 3 weeks in and the first of my support agents resigned it was just too much then the second one resigned within another week or so so it was just me and one other support agent now and the messages just kept pouring in I tried my best to create articles that would explain some of the questions that kept recurring but it didn't help see as long as there's a live chat icon on your website users will use it and if they have to wait more than 5 minutes for a reply it's a bad experience and there was no way we could keep a response time that low my last support guy kept going like a soldier but it was pointless and the onear ratings kept coming in one after the other this just wasn't fair so I took the hard decision and I let him go at this point I was desperate that ding sound from our chat software was starting to give me trauma I could literally hear it in my sleep little did I know that what was about to happen was going to be far more agonizing I was desperate so I did the thing I removed the live chat from our app and website then it got quiet like dead quiet it was almost unsettling for a moment though this felt fantastic like a ton of weight was taken off my shoulders but obviously I knew that the problem didn't go away from just removing live chat and looking at my strip dasboard the next day confirmed my fear users were turning faster than I had ever seen before and now support emails were pouring in way faster that I could possibly manage to keep up I desperately needed to come up with a solution should I hire new support staff how long would it take to unboard them would this just create more problems and more overhead I was paralyzed it was truly one of these moments where I just closed my eyes and wished that the problem would magically go away but then I got an idea one of our features is a chat bot that helps write content for social media like chat GPT but specifically trained for Content what if I turned this chat bot into an AI support assistant if I could train it to know everything about my business it could answer users questions and help them with their problems around the clock it wouldn't need breaks it wouldn't need sleep it would always become C under pressure and it wouldn't even ask for pay hey I got to work and I spent the next 2 weeks grinding trying to solve this problem once and for all I realized that there would still be situations where users needed to get in contact with our team so I built a ticketing system directly into notion which we were already using for project management I added the chatbot the ticketing system and I pushed to production and the results were absolutely mind-blowing churn went down Revenue stabilized customer satisfaction went up users were happy at least in most cases we were still receiving tickets and emails but the need for human support was reduced by almost 90% compared to before absolutely mind-blowing and at this point I was not in doubt I had to turn this into a sass I am so excited to present a base an AI powered support ecosystem built to give your users and outstanding customer experience on autopilot you can create a chatbot in minutes and start training it on your own data right away add your landing page your blog posts medium articles or any other public website add any public YouTube videos upload documents such as PDF and create a custom knowledge based as an FAQ using a Bas Rich editor then add the chat bot to your website or app and have it answer all your users questions of course from the a based dashboard you can monitor all convers ation your users are having and uncover knowledge gaps in the replies your chatbot is giving if you notice it's answering incorrectly it's easy to exclude a specific piece of knowledge and by using the FAQ you can always create a new answer that better addresses the exact question this is perfect for customer support but it also works really well if you're a Creator or public person and you want an AI version of yourself that your audience can interact with in fact I have an AI version of myself on my website ready to answer Christians about SAS I mentioned before that we build a ticketing system into notion it worked well but it was very homemade and quite hard to use so instead we recreated the perfect AI power ticketing system in a base you can create a custom ticket form using our no code form Builder and easily embedded into your app this allows your users to create tickets which will appear in your 8base dashboard from here you can communicate with the user handle their issues and make sure they get a smooth experience the AI behind this ticket system uses your training data too but it also learns from every ticket you resolve and uses this to make Smart Suggestions when a new ticket comes in this will help you and your tech support team resolve issues 10 times faster with eight base you can stop spending unnecessary time on customer support or you're a developer that's awesome cuz we have made everything highly customizable and developer friendly you can take full control over the 8base elements and integrate them into into your app in countless different ways everything is built using web components so it doesn't care which UI framework you're using and it doesn't pollute your site with heavy eye frames you can set up web hooks to notify other parts of your system when tickets are updated new comments are created and much more and if you're not a developer don't worry cuz you can set up all chat Bots and ticket forms in a no code fashion too and we offer a hosted ticket page where your users can access all their Open tickets we're already working on in creations with a lot of third party tools and we're going to have email support announcements feature requests and a public API for teams that really want full control and here's the deal this tool has already been so valuable to us that I really just want to share it with you which is why you can get started with a base completely for free we have a free plan no trial you don't need to add a credit card you can literally just sign up and start using it but you probably know that offering this kind of AI tool at scale isn't exactly cheap so on a free plan you will be limited to 50 messages per month however if you bring your own API key from open AI we're going to remove this limit entirely you can use eight base for free with unlimited messages if you bring your own API key check the link in the description below and sign up for an a Bas account today are you still here thank you for listening to my story if you're a s founder with any level of Commercial Success big or small all I'm sure you've had a similar experience with customer support if you're using crisp chat or inom on your website right now and you're struggling to keep up with replies here's the best advice I can give you remove it studies show that having a live chat and not being able to deliver response within 5 minutes is a worse custom experience than not having a live chat at all so remove it and give eight base a try instead let me know what you think of our new project in the comments below I will see you soon for another video
