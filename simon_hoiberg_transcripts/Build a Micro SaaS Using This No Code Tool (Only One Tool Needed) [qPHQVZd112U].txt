================================================================================

no coat just keeps getting better and better we can now build an entire SAS product including membership subscriptions gated content all using one Unified no code tool this is big news for upcoming SAS Founders who don't program last year I showed you how to create a SAS only using no code tool but the problem is we had to use a whole stack of different tools to make this work and it required quite a bit of glue and duct tape to keep it all together what if we could slice away most of this Tower and build it all with one tool instead as it turns out we can webflow recently launched memberships in public Beta And this is everything we need to create and launch in micro SAS using one single no-code tool and it's so cool this basically allows you to create a full and secure user authentication flow manage paid subscriptions through webflow's existing e-commerce solution and create custom gated content for your users without having to use anything but webflow and a stripe account for payment let's consider this idea we want to offer course platform as a SAS we already have a small network of creators who will upload courses regularly and we want to give users access to this platform through a subscription there should be two plans a regular plan and a Premium plan which gives you access to longer and more detailed courses the user should be able to pick a plan when they sign up we can now do all of this with webflow we can create a basic block and flow where users can sign up and we can create separate access groups which give different groups of users access to different content so let's take a look at a webflow site you now have this users button in the menu and by clicking this we can enable memberships on our site we'll get a warning since this isn't beta but once we enable this we will get a section that reminds a bit of the CMS where we can manage content in this setup guide we get a full breakdown of things we need to go through let's go to the e-commerce section and set up our subscription packages the product type is a membership we'll call it learner and we can give it a description and upload images if we want under billing we'll choose subscription we'll set this to nine dollars a month and as we can see webflow does require us to connect a stripe account before publishing this site so you will need to set up a stripe account that you can use to handle payment but it's super easy you can connect it under settings and webflow we'll quickly set up a second membership called premium which is 19 a month webflow really managed to make this a super smooth experience so not only do I not have to worry about user authentication and payment which is something that needs to be super secure but I can also manage my plans and pricing for the SAS within webflow's e-commerce section super cool so now that we have our plans ready we can set up two access groups for each of these plants foreign we're gonna map each of them to the memberships we just created and here's the cool part because the Premium plan should have access to everything on the learner plan plus everything on the Premium plan we can just associate both there we go see how incredibly easy that was we didn't need to write a single line of code we didn't need to create a separate account on member stack we didn't need to set up anything in airtable and we didn't need to glue anything together with sap here now here's where the fun part begins let's head back to the setup guide we can see that webflow wants us to design four different pages here one for signing up and signing in one for the user's account page and one for showing access denied if you're trying to show a part of the app that you don't have access to these are utility pages that webflow set up for us so we don't have to worry about the functionality you just need to design them if you bought a webflow template chances are it included the password page so keep the styling consistent I suggest simply snatching the styles from this one the X's denied page will just leave as is for now and the last one is the user account page let's just give that one a small brush up as well awesome our basic membership system is ready now let's set up what the users are actually signing up for the courses but before I do that let me quickly introduce the sponsor of this video Tiny kiwi tiny Q is a lightweight design tool you can use to create amazing visual creatives in a matter of seconds it's like canva but way easier to figure out take your image or screenshot resize drag and drop add text and background and there literally in seconds and it always ends up looking super professional it's free to use you don't have to sign in literally just go to timekv.io to start using the editor if you want access to more advanced features it costs nine dollars a month that's it okay okay I have to tell you something my team and I were so impressed by this tool that we bought it we literally acquired it and integrated it into our other SAS feed Hive which is a social media management tool so here's the deal today go to the description and find the link and the promo code I've added there this will give you 25 off on the first year on any feed Hive subscription you want and then we'll give you unlimited access to Tiny kiwi for free believe me they play so well together with feed types AI tools and Tiny KV your social media content will never be boring again alright back to the video Let's sum up what we've done so far we've enabled memberships on our webflow website we've set up two paid plans for our members we mapped two access groups to these plants and we'll get back to why that's important in a moment and redesigned the sign in the sign up and the user account page now we need to give our subscribers access to the courses that are available on their plan we'll do this by creating two CMS collections containing the courses that's going to be available on each plan we'll call this one learner courses and we can add any fields that we think will be necessary here all courses will have a name and the slot which is basically a link but we also want to add a thumbnail a description and a URL to a video on Vimeo this is going to be the actual course let's create this collection then duplicate it and call this one premium courses for now the collections will be identical but we could add fields for things like quizzes or FAQs to the premium courses if we wanted to now here's the important part in webflow a CMS collection page will be created for each collection and we can now limit the access to these Pages by using the access groups we created just before so if we click the settings icon for the premium courses template here we can now restrict the access to specific members which in this case would be the premium access group and we'll do the same with the learner courses but here we'll allow members on both access groups since a premium member should also have access to the learner courses as well there we go these collections were now gated behind a subscription paywall and now if we have a page called courses that simply lists all courses that we have available we can keep this page public for everyone to see but if you click a course and you're not on the right plan you will simply see X is denied now this looks very dull but this is an excellent opportunity to highlight all the benefits of being a paying member and prompt the user to upgrade if you're signed in as a paid member you'll get access to the course and the user can now enjoy the content they've been paying for so this is how to set up a course platform as a SAS only using webflow remember this feature is still in beta so changes might happen it's also a bit limited right now for instance you can only have a thousand members on your site but the webflow team has clearly stated that this limitation will be lifted once this feature is out of beta and of course it could be that you want to offer your users something more Dynamic than courses a SAS that has more functionality and solves a problem and thinks a more advanced interface and business logic but hold your horses because webflow is soon going to launch logic which is a way to add Advanced Automation and logic to your website this is going to be a complete Game Changer in the meantime I highly recommend checking out this video up next here I'm going through eight no-code tools that you can use to build a website web apps mobile apps and advanced automation be sure to
