================================================================================

this year started out rough 2023 was a turbulent year with full Market breakdowns and the beginning of 2024 showed higher turn slower growth and more startups going bust that we had seen in a long time and here I was running not one not two but four bootstrapped SAS products looking at my stripe account was painful the symptoms of the market movements were very clear I had to do something to save s business but I had no idea what to do next fortunately someone told me about this place where I could go and get help and of course I was desperate to find a solution so I went down there hello hello um I need to talk to a GPT hi Simon I'm a GPT generation 5 what can I help you with oh um I need to talk to an expert on SAS businesses absolutely I can help you with that what do you need to know okay um the market it's going crazy everything is down I need you to help me figure out how to save my SAS business of course though remember remember that the ideas I'm about to share with you are only starting points and shouldn't be seen as professional advice every business is unique and what works for one might not work for another yes thank you good my prediction is that there are four SAS trends that will be dominating the markets in 2024 tapping into any of these Trends might be exactly what you need to save your business do you want to hear more about these Trends that's why I'm here great the first one is white label s okay like letting people put their own logo and branding on my product and host it on their domain yes exactly okay uh I mean I'm actually already doing that with one of my products feed hiive some of our users are big agencies and they manage social media for their clients they want to invite their clients to a feed hiive workspace but they don't want it to say Fe Ty in the App instead they want their own name and logo and they want the app to be hosted on their domain but why is this going to be a trend in 2024 yes what you're describing is white labeling in the traditional sense but typically when people ask if they can wh label your SAS what they're actually asking is if they can resell it resell it yes and this is exactly what's becoming popular let me show you how it works a SAS company creates a SAS and provides the ability to upload a custom logo change the colors the fonts and the ability to provide access to a a custom domain a reseller buys a license to resell the SAS then puts their logo and name on it repackages it and sets their own price finally the end user buys access to the SAS and as far as they're concerned they think the SAS they're using is whatever the reseller chooses to call it I see reselling SAS software not bad what's the next one I'm not sure I understand you said there were four SAS Trends what's the next Trend I'm sorry your daily conversation limit has been reached please come back again tomorrow it was a very interesting conversation with the GPT and a very interesting suggestion it reminds me about dropshipping just for SAS and if you think about it some of the first people to jump on board with the Drop Shipping Trend did end up creating really successful businesses and I bet the wholesalers that were providing products made great business from this too I think there are two types of Founders who can greatly benefit from this new trend the first type is the founder who is an absolute beginner and wants to get started building a sass brand this type of founder typically has no experience with software engineering and no experience with building and maintaining a SAS not even using no code he is on the other hand great at marketing and creating a brand and because he can WID label a SAS that's already built he can enter the SAS market and start building his own SAS brand with almost no barrier to ENT the downside is that he has very little control over the actual SS he's selling what happens when users have technical issues when bugs need to be fixed what happens when they have feature requests all you can do is forward these issues and request to the SAS owner and hope that they'll deal with it which is risky since he might end up hurting his brand and reputation and the second type of founder is of course the technical SAS founder who knows how to create a SAS platform but isn't very strong on marketing or simply doesn't prefer spending a whole lot of time on that part there is a huge opportunity for this type of founder as he can do what he does best building software product and then let the resellers be out there on the market competing with each other in building the SAS brand of course he would still have to do a bit of marketing of his SAS as a white label SAS solution but since he could charge the resellers either based on commission or simply just charge them a quite significant amount for a license he wouldn't need nearly as many resellers as customers to make the economics of a SAS like this work the GPT was definitely onto something here though there's just one huge downside I couldn't really get off my mind as a white label provider you're basically sharing the market with your resellers feed hiive already has a wh label solution for agencies go to feed.com and sign up for an account use their white label solution to besides that it's already a pretty established brand so in my situation I wouldn't want to resell this product at this time I had to go back and talk to the GPT again I'm ready to hear about the next SAS Trend I'm glad you're back the next trend is a little controversial but try to listen with an open mind it's selling your sass as a lifetime deal a lifetime deal you mean like only charge for it once and then the user can use it forever that's exactly right no no no no I can't do that my products have ongoing cost so I'll try charge for users on an ongoing basis simple as that I understand why you feel that way but let me put this into perspective for you one of the reasons the market is down is because of subscription fatigue SAS businesses that run entirely on subscriptions are increasingly struggling to convert users all SAS products have churn no user actually stays forever even if they purchased your SAS on a lifetime offer really yes and on a classical subscription model you can use your churn braate to to calculate the average lifetime value of a subscriber that is the amount of money the average user pays before they churn if you charge the average lifetime value of a subscriber upfront as a lifetime purchase and assume the same churn rate the overall Revenue would be exactly the same but hold on it's not just about Revenue I don't want my users to devalue my product for instance I have big plans for one of my tools it's a design tool called tiny kiwi and it is going to be the next canva and I want my users to understand that you have big plans and that's great but let's be honest Simon is it really going to be the next canva well it has the potential I think it could be honestly probably not it's a very small tool it's limited and then there's absolutely no shame in that small and limited tools are amazing for some users they're much easier to use than complex tools like canva and with a small and limited tool the ongoing cost to run it will be minimal it sounds perfect for a lifetime deal you really think I should do this I'm sorry your daily conversation limit has been reached mother I would be lying if I said that didn't hurt but the GPT was right tiny Q was there ever going to be the next canva not even close tiny K is a tool I acquired last year today its primary purpose is to enhance the experience of feed hiive when creating fast social media posts the tool is almost entirely powered by the browser and makes relatively few database calls there are almost no backend operation at all I have a designer who creates new templates for tiny qwi but besides that my team doesn't really spend time on this tool and the GPT had a point this tool cost around $120 per month to run in total even as the userbase scales and after thinking about it for a while I decided to give it a try I created some nice looking Facebook ads to promote tiny kiwi as a lifetime offer instead of a subscription I hit the publish button and to my surprise it worked in the first month tiny kiwi made almost $110,000 in sales more than it had ever done before on a subscription model and with close to no maintenance this is almost like a passive income stream running entirely on Lifetime deals I was pumped to finally see a success One S product saved but what about the rest I wasn't very impressed at first but at this point I really needed to go back and hear what else the gpg had to [Music] say hello Simon I'm sorry but your daily conversation limit has been reached that's why you cannot get in but you said that yesterday correct you need to wait for 24 hours to pass GPT 5 is using a usage-based pricing model but in order to protect your finances we had a daily limit why can't I just get a subscription then at the moment we only offer a usage based pricing model as this model is gaining popularity with users in the SAS Market really yes cust customers love the clarity fairness and transparency when they see a direct correlation between usage and cost this helps build trust with our users interesting can you tell me more about that of course usage based pricing is very straightforward you pay for what you use no flat fees no guessing games about which plan fits best it's a model that aligns cost directly with the value received this model has been a game Cher for startups and small businesses that are cost sensitive and prefer a flexible cost structure yes usage based pricing also encourages users to explore a product more freely they're not boxed into specific features based on your subscription tier instead they have the entire toolbox at their disposal paying only for what they find useful ha you just slipped up you just told me about the third SAS Trend without me having to pay for it didn't you I knew it stupid AI you probably encountered this model more often lately especially with cloud services and apid driven tools and it makes perfect sense flat fee subscription models which is the most commonly used model today often Force users to pay for features they don't use imagine a SAS tool offering API calls or using AI as a core part of its features with usage based pricing you pay per call or per generated output you use more you pay more use less you pay less it's that simple I think this is is another great way to combat subscription fatigue on the other hand for SAS companies this model can be a bit tricky to implement it requires robust tracking and billing systems to Monitor and charge for usage accurately I know stripe has something called metered billing built-in but it's very basic in most cases it probably won't be enough and you'll have to deal with implementing a Billing System yourself also Revenue becomes more variable which can be a challenge for financial planning if you're offering a fully usage-based model with no base price most likely the average revenue per user will drop compared to the flat fee model though I do think that there are a lot of cases where the benefits outweigh a usage-based model can attract a broader range of customers especially those who are cost conscious or have fluctuating needs it's also a powerful tool for scaling as customers who grow will naturally increase their usage leading to higher revenues in the world of cloud and infrastructure Services we've been used to this model for a long time one of my Sal products is a base it's an AI powered support tool and after talking to the GPT I was definitely considering a usage based pricing model for this tool but before making a decision I had to know about the last SAS Trend the 24 hours were up I could finally go back hey GPT I'm ready for the last SAS Trend oh I'm sorry as for my knowledge cut off I don't have any knowledge of other SAS Trends besides the ones I've already told you about you're kidding right you said there were four SAS Tren I could use to say save my business you only gave me three so far I apologize for the confusion I only know about three SAS trends that are gaining popularity in 2024 they are white label SAS lifetime deals and usage-based pricing is there anything else I can help you with no no no I'm good you know what let me give you the last SAS Trend that's not how we usually do this just listen focus on building a micro SAS I know this isn't exactly a new trend but it's a trend I'm certain will become even bigger in 2024 some of the biggest sass tools we all know jira hopspot MailChimp Soho sent dis Salesforce have all been around for ages and besides generating enormous Revenue figures they all have one thing in common yes they were all built by Founders who they're slow that's what they have in common they're built on old technology and they're so bloated with features that while they do solve a thousand different problems the software itself is painfully slow and confusing to use this is why users increasingly prefer using micras but when you say micro SAS what exactly do you mean a micras is a lightweight specialized software product built to solve something very specific for a very specific type of user users love them because they're fast to use they often have a very minimalistic UI and they enable users to solve that very specific problem in a very efficient way Founders love them because they're much faster to build and get to Market there's less code to maintain and they're often quite beginner friendly I'm sorry but I don't think these so-called micro SAS solve a real problem true the challenge with micras is finding that perfect specific user with a specific problem to solve rather than dealing with complex software engineering ideally you want a problem that is small but frequent enough that it becomes worth paying for a solution and these problems can be found everywhere around us ask your friends and family what was a tiny pain you had today you wish you could be without write all the answers down look at patterns and see if some of these could potentially be solved with a micro SAS I learned a lot from the GPT I think these four SAS Trends white label lifetime deals usage based pricing and micro are going to show up a whole lot in the next years to come and I think it makes perfect sense to capitalize on that but I also learned that Trends aren't everything business Cycles will come and go growth isn't linear and sometimes all you have to do is just stick it out focus on getting through the tough times and prepare yourself for another ride up the roller coaster at a later point and hey if you don't have a SAS yet you should start building one what are you waiting for it's easy after all all you have to do is I'm sorry your daily conversation limit has been reached
