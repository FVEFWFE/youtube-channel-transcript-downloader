We spend so much time optimizing for all the things that drive more revenue, sales, features, launch campaigns, promotions, but we almost never optimize for the one metric that actually keeps the company alive. The joy of running your business. One of the worst things I can imagine is doing a 9 to-ive job I hate. But what if you end up hating the job you created for yourself? With all the new AI tools that allow us to do more, we might feel obligated to constantly do more and it's a recipe for disaster. So, in this video, I want to share three specific systems I've used while building my business. Systems that will keep you out of the chaotic hustle till you drop mentality and allow you to actually make money while you enjoy life. The first system is what I call the 50 3020 rule. Imagine you have three buckets. Every single activity you do in your business goes into one of these. The smallest bucket is what I call the suck bucket. This is for work that frankly sucks. It's draining. It's boring and it's tedious. Taxes, legal compliance, fixing server crashes or dealing with angry customers. It sucks, but it's highly needlemoving. It must be done to keep the business alive. Then we have the middle bucket, the joy bucket. This is for work that feels like play. It energizes you. It brings you excitement, but it's not necessarily important. It might even be a waste of time from a purely business perspective. And finally, the big bucket, the magic bucket. This is the combination of the two. This is work that you find meaningful and fun, but at the same time has a massive impact on your business. Now, look at the sizes of these buckets. This is the ratio you need to aim for. At most 20% of your work should be in the suck bucket. At most 30% of your work should be in the joy bucket. And at least 50% of your work must be in the magic bucket. And this is where I see so many founders going wrong. They listen to the hustle gurus who tell them it's all about discipline and suffering. So they turn their entire business into one giant suck bucket. They optimize for revenue but optimize for misery. On the other hand, you have the indie hackers who just want to build cool stuff. They try to make their business one huge joy bucket. They code all day, refuse to do marketing, and they never get anywhere because they're essentially just running a hobby. The key to a company you love running is to hitting this specific ratio. And I know this is easier said than done. First, you have to accept that you need to get out of your comfort zone. I know so many technical founders who struggle to get over themselves and do sales and marketing. For them, writing code is fun. Marketing goes straight into the suck bucket. But you have to do it. There's no way around it. But at the same time, and this is the part people forget, you must allow yourself to waste time. I still script, film, and edit all of my YouTube videos myself. I can't count how many business experts have told me that I need to outsource this. You should be working on your business, not in your business, Simon. Maybe, but I'm having a great time. It goes into my joy bucket. And that joy provides the fuel I need to handle the boring stuff. But most importantly, you need to figure out what goes into that 50% magic bucket. Because if you cannot fill 50% of your week with work that is both profitable and enjoyable, that is a symptom that you don't have a business. Either you have a fun hobby that makes no money, or you have a business, but it's really a job you're going to end up hating. So, once you've categorized your activities, the next question is, how do you actually schedule them so that the things you enjoy stay enjoyable? The second system is the four-week rotation schedule. I created this system because I see almost every founder falling into one of two specific traps. The first trap is the contact switcher. This is the founder who tries to be the CEO, CTO, CMO, and support lead every single day. They write code in the morning, answer tickets at lunch, and try to write social media post in the evening. And the result of that is that they're constantly shallow. They write buggy code because they're distracted and generic marketing copy because their brain is still in debug mode. But then there's the second trap, and this is the one that's even more dangerous. It's the comfort worker. This is the founder who takes one specific activity, usually building the product, and just stays there. They treat their business like it's the 100% joy bucket. They keep adding features, telling themselves that they will do marketing next week or once the product is perfect, but next week never comes. They hide in their comfort zone while their business slowly dies. And I had this issue too. I was the context switcher and it became a huge issue. So, I came up with this idea of themed weeks, which I now call the four-week rotation schedule. This solves both of these problems. It stops the context switcher from drowning in noise, and it forces the comfort worker to actually step out of the code editor and do the work that grows the business. So, here's how I split my month. Week one is build week. This is deep work. I put my headphones on, I close social media, and I build. The goal here is to ship features. I'm the CTO. I'm not trying to sell anything. I'm just making the product better. Week two is marketing week. Total shift of energy. I take the developer hat off and I put the marketer hat on because I know I can focus entirely on this for a whole week. I can actually go deep and do it properly instead of treating it like something I just have to finish so I can get back to building. Week three is ops week. This is where we tackle the sock bucket. We automate, we document, and we streamline operations. If I found myself doing a repetitive task in the previous two weeks, this is the week I set up workflows to automate it. And finally, week four is Slack week. This is where you relax, recharge, and let your mind wander. And I know the hustle cultural reaction to this is you can't take a week off every single month. That's lazy. But it isn't about being lazy. It's actually quite strategic. The best ideas for your business never come when you're staring at the code editor trying to get views on social media. They come when you're walking in nature, when you're having casual conversations with your spouse, or when you're reading something in a new book. You need space to think. And Slack week is the only time you get to step out of the loop and ask yourself, is this even the right direction? Now, obviously, this is a framework, not a law of physics. If a critical server crashes during marketing week, I'm not going to ignore it. And if a huge social media opportunity drops during build week, I'll take it. But this schedule is my default state. It protects me from the chaos of doing everything at once. And it forces me to do the important things I might otherwise avoid. But even with the perfect bucket ratio and a perfect schedule, things will eventually go wrong. You will lose a big customer. You will ship a bug that deletes data. You will get a hate comment that ruins your morning. And when that happens, no amount of scheduling will save you. You need a protocol for handling the emotional hit. This brings us to the final rule. It's less of a business framework and more of a rule of life. It's the 45se secondond rule. I learned this back when I was working in sales. Sometimes we would spend weeks warming up a lead, doing demos, negotiating terms, and then at the very last minute the deal would fall through. It was tremendously demoralizing. But because we had a strict quota to hit, we didn't have time to sulk. So we had a rule. You get 45 seconds. Start the watch for 45 seconds. You are allowed to be fully frustrated. You can be angry. You can feel sorry for yourself. You can curse the client. Let it all out. But when the time is up, you move on. You pick up the phone and you call the next prospect. Because here's the truth. If you carry that negativity and grudge into the next call, you're going to ruin that sale, too. And I still carry this rule with me today. Now, it's not always exactly 45 seconds. Sometimes it's 5 minutes. Sometimes it's an hour. Sometimes it's even longer. But the agreement I make with myself is the same. I set a timer for how long I'm allowed to stay pissy over whatever happened. And when the timer hits zero, I force myself to let it go. Because if you let a bad morning turn into a bad week, you will never see the end of it. I know this is quite different from the traditional business guru talk you get on YouTube, but I hope you're open to give some of these approaches a try.
