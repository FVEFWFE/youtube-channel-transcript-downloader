================================================================================

I found the perfect stack for AI product development. And AI now writes 90% of my code. This exact AI stack has enabled me and my team to push out features and improvements faster than we have ever done before. The technology is finally here. Yet you'll see people saying this third rate fake worst code rejecting all AI written code. &gt;&gt; Your customers want you. But I can assure you AI product development does work. And if you use it right, it can make you more productive than you've ever been before. It can even allow low tech and non- tech founders to build incredible SAS solutions all by themselves. So in this video, I will walk you through this AI stack and show you the exact AI product development workflow. It consists of three tools and three approaches you have to use if you want this to work. If you're new to this channel, welcome here. I'm Simon Horberg and I run a SAS portfolio of four tools to handle social media automation, link tracking, AI, customer support, and graphics design. We are a small team of just four people, myself included, and we're on track to do $2 million AR in 2025 using the exact AI development stack I'm about to show you. The first layer of our stack is vibe coding. This is typically going to be the starting point of a new SAS or new major feature. Not long ago, this starting point used to look completely different. Typically, we would spend a lot of time planning a new feature. We would draft the designs in Figma. We would then tweak and polish and turn it into a prototype. Then finally, we would hand it off to one of our three developers who would manually start implementing it. And if you think this was timeconuming, you're absolutely right. And we were everything considered a small team. Earlier when I was working as a freelance consultant at huge companies I saw how this step would take months sometimes up to a year to complete and it would literally just be the starting point of a new feature or product. With AI this whole thing has completely changed. We now do all of this using one single tool. That tool is called lovable. By simply using natural language and by describing the vibe we want, we're now planning, drafting, designing, and prototyping all using one single tool. Lovable is built to be non or low tech friendly. So on our team, our UIUX designer does this. She will use some UIUX and software terminology, but other than that, she lets Lovable go at it just from a vibe. And Lovable does an impressive job at putting together an amazing looking, clean, and well-designed front end. And if we take a look at the code it produces, we'll see that it also puts together a well ststructured project using the latest and most popular frameworks and UI libraries. So in just a few hours with Lovable, we have a design, a prototype, and a starter in real application code ready to go. We'll sync it directly with GitHub to access the project from other tools if we need it. The next layer of our AI stack is agentbased coding. Once we have a starter, we want AI agents to continue the work asynchronously in the background. This is the step where I personally have become the most productive. Having a team of AI agents with access to my entire code base, all my repositories who will start working on the task I give them, do it all in the background, and come back with a PR. This has been a total game changer. Here's how it works. GitHub is a platform where you can store code and a PR is basically code suggestions that haven't yet been merged into the official codebase that goes out in production and becomes available to your users. Now, you give an AI agent a task. The AI agent will download your codebase from GitHub and start working on the task in the cloud. Once it's finished, it will create a PR on GitHub where you can review, request changes, or approve. There are multiple tools that can do this already, but one that does this really well is GitHub Copilot, which is already fully integrated into GitHub itself. In your repository, you simply click issues, which is GitHub's words for task. [Music] Here, you describe the task you need done. You sign GitHub Copilot and a few moments later, depending on the complexity, you will see a new PR under the pull request tab. From here, you can review the solution and either approve or ask C-pilot to make a few more changes. If you're a developer, you can review the actual code it wrote here, which I definitely recommend. And if not, I suggest configuring your hosting service like Verscell or Amplify to create a preview link where you can see the changes in action. And the awesome part about this workflow is that the agents are working on your solution completely asynchronously. So you don't have to be in front of your screen or keep a code editor open while it's doing its thing. Instead, you can split your work up in three, five, 10 smaller tasks, fill them out on GitHub, and let your agents work on them all while you do other things. Now, it's worth pointing out that the quality of the results highly depends on the quality of the task description you give it. And if it doesn't get it right, it does take a bit of time for it to go back and work every time you ask it to do something new. If you can include some technical description and engineering terminology here when you write these task descriptions, it does help the AI tremendously in doing a proper job. If you're a non-tech or low tech, GitHub does have a basic chat interface too where you can include your codebase and talk to the AI about it. And it might make sense to spend a bit of time with the AI here agreeing on what the task is and then have GitHub Copilot write its own task description. As I mentioned before, there are other tools doing the same thing. One of them is claw code, but personally I really dislike using a terminal for this and it's not really friendly for low or non- tech users. Also, GitHub C-Pilot is really generous with their limits right now. I'm on a $39 a month plan and I haven't managed to max this one out yet. The final layer is AI assisted coding. With this approach, we're pair programming with AI, but we're actually participating in the process using a code editor with built-in AI capabilities. For this part, you need to have at least some basic understanding of programming fundamentals and know your way around a code base. I would say low tech people can work at this level, especially if you're patient and naturally interested in trying to learn to code. Though, you will get most out of this step if you are a more routine software engineer. The most powerful and most popular tool for this layer of the stack is cursor. However, there are native extensions you can install in VS Code such as Klein or again GitHub Copilot which are picking up and getting really good too. Personally, I bounce between cursor and GitHub copilot and VS Code. They're both really powerful and strong options when it comes to AI assisted coding. Although cursor is generally ahead when it comes to delivering a smooth developer experience, but honestly I haven't really spent a whole lot of time coding like this recently. Both I and my team are now spending most of our time in layer 1 and layer two of this stack. Just this last month, we've built and launched an end toend Vibe marketing experience for one of our products, FeedHive. We've updated and tested a bunch of new features and improvements, and we've finished a completely new SAS that I'll be launching soon. If you go to foundersstack.pro, you can see all the products we're building, and you can buy lifetime access to all of them for a single one-time purchase. 90% of our efforts were spent in layer 1 and layer 2 when building this stack. A lot of people say vibe coding produces extremely lowquality results. And as I see it, it all comes down to two reasons. Most often, it's simply a matter of half-assed, rushed, lowquality prompts and task descriptions. If you went to Upwork and hired a human developer and gave them this same description, I can guarantee you the results will be extremely low quality, too. Like, what did you expect? Secondly, there is a limitation if you know absolutely nothing about coding. So, if you're completely non- tech and want to build a SAS this way, I highly encourage you to become at least low tech or maybe even a lightweight software developer. You don't have to pass an exam. You don't have to pass a job interview or get to a level where anyone would formally hire you, but just spend a bit of time learning some basic fundamentals of software engineering. And I promise you, the final output of VIP coding will become exponentially better. So, now you know how to build, but maybe you still don't know what to build. I got you. Cuz there's a way you can access thousands of ideas that people need but haven't yet been turned into a SAS. And in this video, I'll show you how. So, jump over here and I will see you there.
