I'm pretty sure you've seen this before you search on Google trying to find that tool and boom up comes three to four other similar tools on top of the results you were looking for and yes they're at trying to steal their competitors users this is the dirty game of advertisement and if you're building a SAS most likely this will happen to you as well very soon the question is is there a way to protect yourself from this or should you just get dirty with everyone else and start running competitor ads too without going too deep into the moral and ethical discussion of this the short answer is yes you 100 should for two reasons obviously to drive conversions but there's another one you can actually use this to spy on how well your competitors are doing I'll get back to that in a moment in this video I'll show you how to protect yourself against competitor ads I'll show you an insanely easy way to set up your own competitor ads and I'll show you a sneaky takeaway that I haven't heard anyone mention before let's get started so first of all can you protect yourself from your competitors running these kinds of ads targeting your brand name the short answer is practically no according to Google's policies you cannot use your competitors trademark in your ad copy if you find a violation of this you can file a report to Google and they'll take your competitors ads down but that means you need to submit a trademark registration on your Brand's name which costs around 500 just in the US and you'll have to do this in all countries where you want your brand name to be protected some Services handle this internationally but it easily cost five thousand dollars or more and they still don't cover all countries in the world and even if you do all this your competitors can still run ads on your Brand's name they're allowed to use it as a keyword they just can't use your name in the ad copy itself so practically you can't really protect yourself against this however there is a way you can soften the blow a little I'll show you in a second so let's just join the Dark Side and start running our own competitor ads Fight Fire with Fire and make some money while we're doing it this next part will blow your mind because there's a hecky way we can effectively Target at all our competitors with one campaign one asset and one single ad it's easy to set up and super easy to manage let's do it go to ads.google.com and create a new account if you don't have one already go to goals conversions and set up a new conversion action you'll need to install a Google tag on your website and you need to decide what a conversion should be typically this is a user signing up for your SAS once your conversion goal is set up we can create a new campaign for the campaign objective you can select either leads or sales it doesn't really matter now add the sign up conversion goal you just created before the campaign type we'll pick search and we'll add our website here and pay the name and we can move on we want to focus on conversions and we can skip the target CPA for now we'll exclude the Display Network we will keep the default settings for everything else all right this is where it gets fun here we're going to add a list of all our competitors names we're going to wrap them in square brackets there are three different ways Google can match a keyword if you just type the word or sentence Google will use broad match that means that Google will match the keyboard or any other keyword that somehow relates to it I personally never use this it's quite a black box and your ads might end up showing in all kinds of crazy places for a campaign like this we certainly don't want to use this if we wrap the word or sentence in quotes Google will use phrase match this means that Google will show your ad on Search terms that include your keyword much better but for this specific campaign it's still not good enough we want to get very specific with the search term where our ads will show and it'll be clear why in a moment finally if we wrap the word or sentence in square brackets Google will use exact match that means that Google will Target the exact keyword or sentence that's used or keywords that have a very similar meaning that's exactly what we want so let's go ahead and add a long list of competitors and square brackets in my case I'm advertising one of my SAS products feed Hive which is a social media management tool so I'll fill in a lot of competitors in this market both big and small finally let's create our ad now a bit of human psychology kicks in here so we want to use a very specific phrasing [Music] in the first position we're gonna write disappointed with hit the curly bracket and choose keyboard insertion pick title case and add a default text here what will happen is that Google will substitute this part with the keyword that was just entered so in my case if people search for agrippulse they'll see my ad saying disappointed with egg ripples if they search for HootSuite it'll say disappointed with HootSuite if Google for some reason can't match a keyword it'll just default to disappointed with social so of course make sure to pick a default word that makes sense in your case Google will try to shuffle these headlines so to make sure this one always comes up first we just click this little pin button here and say show only in position one let's add a few more headlines that Google can try only one of these will be shown together with the first one at a time but Google will try them all and see what works best awesome now let's add a few descriptions here you're simply going to sell your service I suggest using some of the copy from your website and again Google will try these in combination with the headlines and move forward with the one that works best all of these are optional but I suggest adding at least a business name and a logo finally set up budget for this campaign I'll run this for a hundred dollars a day but you can put any budget that you're comfortable with here publish the campaign and wait for it to go live now we are using our competitors names directly in the ad copy so if they're trademarked Google might reject some of these keywords that's totally fair it's nothing to worry about that just won't show okay but let's be honest here you're now playing a dirty game your competitors are very likely to notice this and most likely they'll start running ads on your brand name as well and as we discovered before there's no way you can protect yourself against this but you can of course do the obvious which is simply running ads on your own brand name to at least give your competitors some competition when targeting your brand name as a keyboard this is what everyone else is doing and I highly recommend that you do this as well set up another campaign with a single exact matte keyword which is your brand name and run an ad for yourself and is it kind of stupid that we all have to run ads on our own brand name to protect ourselves from competitors ads well it's not a perfect world but I do want to show you a huge bonus that comes from running exactly this kind of ads because there's a secret side effect to this that allow us to get a sneak peek on how well our competitors are actually doing the secret ingredients is the phrasing of the ad disappointed with question mark If a person searches for a tool and they click on a link that says disappointed with that tool that means they're most likely disappointed with that too and Google will tell on them because we can see exactly which of these keywords are delivering the highest click-through rate and the highest conversion rate in my case I have two competitors that are standing out from the rest High Fury and ukoya are taking the lead here while the click-through rate and conversion rate are very high on these tools which means that when people search for these names many of them are likely to click a link that says disappointed with hype Fury or disappointed with okoya and many of them are inclined to actually sign up for feed Hive instead and in the other end of the spectrum we can see that the tools popular and agripauls got a fair amount of Impressions which means many people saw this ad but very few chose to click it it would be fair to interpret that people are very happy with Poplar and Agro pulse and that the sentence disappointed with agribles doesn't seem to resonate very well and this is incredible insight for me as a competitor I should study Hyperion okoya and treat them as good examples of what not to do since people seem disappointed with these tools and at the same time I should study popular and agricults as good examples of what to do right since they seem to have captured a very loyal user base and of course when I have the inside I need I might very well turn off the ad for those low performing competitor names and give more space to show my ads on the tools that are likely to drive conversions we had more than 100 new users sign up for feed Hive just this week from the top 5 competitors on this list I know I'm bringing the actual names of some of my competitors here and I'm not doing this to throw mud this is data and it's something everyone can get so okay hi Fury if you're watching this sorry but not really sorry this is the name of the game and popular I actually see the founder around in various groups on Facebook you're an annoying dude you seem to have done very well here kudos for that I'll be studying you finally it's worth saying that this is just one slice of reality we see here just because I drive a lot of clicks on some keywords and few on others in a setup like this doesn't necessarily mean that they're doing either good or bad obviously there are many factors at play here nothing about this is conclusive but this is a great way to get an impression and of course Drive conversions at the same time I hope
