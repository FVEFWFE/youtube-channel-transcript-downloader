================================================================================

according to public data from indie hackers on average it takes nine months for bootstrap sas to reach a thousand dollar mrr if you can do it in five months you're considered an outlier though if i were to tell you that doing these three things could get you to a thousand dollar mrr after just one month would you try it well we did at my startup and not only did we reach one thousand dollar mr in the first month but we kept adding another thousand dollar mrr every month for the next year and it's not just us in fact almost all successful bootstrap sas are doing this so if you're struggling to get your product off ground chances are that you're like 95 of all sas founders you're either unaware of these three things or you're deliberately ignoring them in this video i'll show you how incredibly powerful these three tactics are and how you can use them to become a super outlier and break a thousand dollar mrr way faster than the average indie hacker let's get started [Music] welcome to my channel i'm simon harberg i'm happy you clicked on this video cause if you're anything like me super excited about sas and online business but also very intimidated by the whole thing i can safely say that this is how we all feel and on this channel i try to be as open and transparent about my own startup journey as i can and now i want to show you these three tactics that everyone can do and while there are no guarantees in startups i see founders who do these three things consistently succeed in launching profitable bootstrap sas products so before i reveal the first tactic let's play a little game of spot the pattern let me show you a few examples of successful bootstrap founders and let's see if you can spot what they have in common here's arvid the founder of feedback panda he bootstrapped his sass to 50 000 mrr before he sold it here's mike the founder of upvotee his product is currently doing more than thirty thousand dollar mrr and growing fast here's tony the creator of blackmagic he started his journey earlier this year and his product is already doing 8 000 mrr so did you spot what these founders have in common they are very active on social media and they share a lot of super valuable content so did you guess it maybe you did and you're already hating it nonetheless the first tactic is build a social media presence but before you turn off this video and throw your phone in anger figuring that you'll never get this many followers just take a deep breath for a second most likely you're overthinking this it's really not that difficult it just takes a certain level of patience and consistency and it's really about just getting started when i was first starting out doing video i didn't have all this fancy equipment i was shooting my videos on my phone i was using normal indoor lamps my teleprompter was a laptop that i put slightly behind the camera i posted these on twitter and people still really liked them along with the written content i did which i also had to experiment with a lot and no i didn't get hundreds of likes in the beginning in fact i barely got any but i kept going and kept focusing on how i could create value so here's what you should do pick a platform of choice i suggest starting out with twitter or linkedin start posting daily one to two posts pick a topic something you want to be known for it doesn't necessarily have to do with the startup you're planning on building but it should be something that you can see yourself posting about long term jump over to canva and create a free account and find some nice image templates that you can use to spice up your content now go to feed hive and sign up for an account you'll be using feed hive to schedule all your content ahead of time so you don't have to spend all your time on social media and guess what feed hive is actually the startup i'm running i created the first version while i was building my own social media presence i've grown a following of more than 200 000 people across four platforms in a little under two years and i've poured everything i learned into this product that's why it's so popular with our users we cover all major platforms and we're using ai to help you create better content and make informed decisions about when and what to post and here's the most important part you don't want to try to monetize your audience for a long time don't post affiliate links don't start selling an ebook or course have patience and just keep sharing valuable content without asking for anything in return no strings attached instead spend the time building authority credibility and start building connections with other creators and entrepreneurs social media is just as much about networking and building relationships as it is about creating content now while you've got the momentum going on your social channels this is where you move on to the next part tactic number two this is the part where you start building your new sas but before you start putting an mvp together there's a thing you want to do first did you guess it that's right you want to find early adopters while you've been building your audience and creating content hopefully you've also connected with a handful of other creators people with their own personal brands and their own audiences and this is extremely powerful first of all you need users to build your product with not for with this is an important difference find a group of people who are interested in what you're planning on building invite them into a closed chat group or discord server now include them in everything all the decision making big and small you're going to build it but they'll help shape the product from day one not only are you much much more likely to actually build a product users want but you're also building a strong group of advocates from day one consider the loyalty you get from this group of users they will genuinely feel like they're part of the project secondly since it's a group of other content creators and entrepreneurs just like yourself they'll all have their own audiences to advocate to you will effectively multiply your reach the day you finally launch this is exactly what i did with vtype when i onboarded the first users the product barely did anything like literally it was a text field on a grey website and a few buttons it was buggy janky ugly as but it was the perfect time to bring in the first user's enclosed beta and this is where most founders make the biggest mistake they build way too far ahead without really having an idea about who they're building for they think validation is having some users say sure that sounds great while presenting the idea once and that's it but that's not enough you need to keep validating your product i built feed hives in vp for almost two months together with this closed group of users and we talked and discussed features every day if we hadn't had countless discussions in those two months about everything from features pricing positioning in the market if i had built everything on my own and made every decision based on gut feeling i would have completely missed the mark and guess what i'm still doing this today over time that small group turned into a facebook group with more than a thousand members but the purpose is still the same building the product in close collaboration with the community behind it i still have my community to take part in the decision making of my startup to this day it's not exactly the same way as in the beginning but the community still helps shape the direction of feed hive alright at this point you might have figured out where this is headed this is all about being open transparent including people and making content from sharing about your journey so of course the last tactic is building in public but before we get carried away here let me just define what i mean by building in public i simply mean creating content from your journey of building a startup and i know there are people who feel very strongly about building in public and the whole open startup movement and that's perfectly fine now i'm just sharing my perspective on building in public and how i see most indie hackers and small startups using it it's a social media marketing strategy that's all it is you want to create and share content that is interesting and valuable to your audience and which in turn drives awareness leads and subscribers to your sas you don't have to share revenue numbers you don't have to reveal how much you're paying your employees and you don't have to share any secrets or insights that you believe are business critical there are literally no obligations at all what you want to do is to include your audience in the journey the process of creating the ups and downs of running a startup content that is valuable and interesting to your audience you want to give people a unique insight into entrepreneurship and what it means to build a sas you want to share tips and give advice share your learnings and findings as they come in skip the boring and generic startup advice people want to see what it's like building a startup for you share all the unique parts all the juicy stuff and don't be afraid that people will judge most people love it when you're honest and open and most people connect better with realistic and small rather than extraordinary and mind-blowing so don't worry a second about having to impress anyone people want to see something realistic something that motivates them and makes them feel like they could do it as well and this is exactly what building in public is really about creating great content content that will move people that's all i started sharing about feed hive a month before it went live the people from the early adopter group started to do the same when i finally launched we went straight to 300 mrr in the first 24 hours and after about a month we had the first thousand dollar mrr no big product on lunch no being on the front page of hacker news no being covered on techcrunch just building a social media presence building the product with a group of eager early adopters creating content about my journey and building in public then launching over a single tweet the research on the public data from indie hackers was done by an individual creator and the data set was pretty small so of course we should take it with a grain of salt nonetheless from what i've seen i don't think the results are way off reaching a thousand dollar mr is way harder than you might think and an average of nine months doesn't seem unreasonable to me on the other hand as we've discovered there's a way that you can beat this average though of course you also need to actually come up with a sas idea that works otherwise this would have been all for nothing in this video i'll show you how to come up with a brilliant sass idea that actually works you should definitely watch this one up next but before you leave remember to give this video a like and subscribe to my channel for more content i will see you soon for another video
