let me present the next generation crypto platform crypto view never lose track of your net worth in crypto currencies a sas product you won't forget also i created this sas only using no code tools and in this video i'll show you how you can do it as well [Music] welcome to my youtube channel and thanks a lot for picking this video i'm simon horberg and i talk a lot about tech sas and online business and if you've been a subscriber to this channel you might remember that i did a video about the perfect tech stack for a sas product a few months ago it's the perfect tech stack for a sas product but the only problem is it contained a whole lot of very complicated code and if you're not a programmer i wouldn't blame you for being completely demoralized while watching it like do i need to understand all this to build a sas fortunately no you can actually build a fully fledged sas product entirely using no-code tools is it beneficial to know programming to store the sas business well of course do you have to no and that's exactly what i'll show you in this video i'll show you how to build your own sas platform including a landing page login system custom user data all without writing a single line of code or to be fair we do need to write a tiny bit of code to make this work but as you'll see it's really not that complicated let's get started let's start by breaking down how we're going to build this and which tools we're going to use we need a website for a product it will contain the marketing material and a page for plans and pricing and a place to sign up it will also contain the actual web app that you get access to after you subscribe to a paid plan in this video i'll refer to this as gated content for this part we'll be using webflow we also need a way to handle subscriptions and payments so people can sign up pick a plan and log in to handle subscriptions we'll be using member stack to process payments we'll be using stripe both member stack and stripe have solutions for no code as well as low code this means that as a sas scale and we may hire developers to do something more custom for us in the future both member stack and stripe can easily be integrated in a new solution now in order to deliver custom functionality for our users we need a database in this case we want users to add their own cryptocurrency assets to their lists and see them when they log in in almost any case we need a database to store data we'll be using airtable for this finally we need something to tie all the pieces together so they can communicate with each other we'll use zapier for this so our no code tech stack will look something like this of course in a more real life scenario i had to add more tools to this setup an important one would be an email service i recommend using sendgrid to handle marketing emails is one of the most reliable services out there and it's pretty straightforward to integrate into your service also if you're not a programmer additionally in order to make your email stand out professional for you and your team i'd recommend using why stamp for email signatures so why stamp is a tool that you can use to create beautiful and professional looking email signatures it's super easy to add your name title link to your social channels and you can pick from a ton of templates can even add your own handwritten signature which i think is super cool and here's the best part if you're a business owner and you manage a team you can add all your employees here and make sure that all signatures from the whole team are streamlined and always up to date you can sign up for free so check out the description below i've added a link that will get you started right away why stamp is also the sponsor of this video so i want to say thank you to the y stamp team for supporting this channel alright let's start getting our hands dirty here the first thing we want to do is to set up an amazing looking website let me introduce webflow a no-code tool for building websites let's head over to webflow and create an account now we'll hit new site and get ready to set up a website so we can create a site from scratch or we can pick a template to start from we're definitely going to be picking a template so the trick is to find one that already looks a lot like the side we imagined for a sas so we don't have to change too much so i'm simply going to search for sass and then let's see what we get i love this one seems like a perfect fit let's get it alright so here we are ready to create this website most of this actually looks good as it is we're just gonna change the copy around here there and there we go now let's just delete these menu items and let's just clean up a few of these sections we don't need so the graphic work here is already outstanding but let's just bring it into figma quickly and add a bit of crypto vibe to it now i'm literally just gonna add some crypto icons to these of course in a real world example you probably want to hire a designer or if you are one spend some more time getting this just right but for now this is great so let's continue giving this page an overhaul it's probably worth pointing out that if you have no experience with html or css whatsoever webflow might feel a little steep when you're just starting out but don't worry webflow has a ton of educational videos in their webflow university and no you don't need to learn html and css in order to make this work just pick a template change things up like i just did here stick to the overall structure and don't get into anything too crazy and you'll be just fine let's go to the pricing page and add a few items here that makes a little more sense there we go i'm happy with this let's publish it done i think this looks really good and this took me almost no time to set up all right now that we have the website done the next thing we need is to create a user login system you also want a way for people to sign up and subscribe to our sas so let's create two pages a login page and a sign up page most of these webflow templates comes with a password utility page let's just copy the layout from this one and modify it slightly now we can just copy the sign up page and make a login page out of it as well now let's make sure the login button sends us to the login page and the get started button will send us to the pricing page so we just want to make sure that clicking on any of the price columns will send us to the sign up page there we go let's publish it alright it's time to create the login system let me present member stack a no code tool used to create logins and payments for your website let's head over to memberstack.io let's create an account then let's add a website from webflow and we'll simply follow these steps let's create a membership and call it professional plan yes we want to require payment and we'll just set a price here and as you can see we can also enable free trials collect taxes and more but we'll just leave it at this for now now we want to pick a part of our website to hide behind the paid membership in this case we want to hide anything on a special portfolio site so this would be anything on our website slash portfolio if people try to visit this page but they're not logged in we'll simply redirect them to the login page awesome that's basically it now let's head over to power-ups and pick member specific pages we want to activate this and add the portfolio path here as well finally we need to integrate the member stack functionality on our webflow site we do this by adding the piece of code right here then head over to webflow click project settings then click the custom code tab then we'll simply add the code here do note that adding custom code to webflow is a paid feature so you'll need a site plan to do this but you can get this for as low as 12 dollars per month and you'll need this to host your website on your own domain anyway so if you haven't upgraded to a side plan already this is a good time to do so now let's create a signup and login form in member stack and wired together with the signup and login page we created in webflow just before so let's go to the form and field section on member stack and create a sign up form we basically want an email field and a password field but we're also going to create a third one called webflow member id but we actually want to hide this one so the user won't see this field on the page but we need it in order to link member stack and webflow together now let's click on the email field we can see that it shows the custom attribute with the name data ms member and the value email let's go and add that to the email field on the login page we'll do the same with the password field and finally we can see that we need to add this to the actual form that wraps both fields let's publish and quickly verify that it works we're gonna sign up here and we're gonna go to the members section in member stack there we go the member got created now the next step is to start wiring things together first we need to create a collection where we can store each member in webflow cms we'll call it members now let's add a few fields the name and slog fields are mandatory that will simply be the name of the member and slug the slug is the last part of the url which will be used to identify a specific member on the page each user also need a field to store their email address and finally we want to add a field for some custom data crypto view is still in beta so the only thing we will be able to do once we sign in is to add cryptocurrencies to a portfolio along with the amount of them that we own so let's create a field called crypto assets that we'll use to store this data and we'll simply pick a plain text field for this now let's save this collection and as we can see here there's no items in this collection yet since we don't have any users in the system now when you create a collection in webflow it'll automatically produce this cms collection page this page is what users see when they log in for now let's just add a text saying portfolio and the button saying add crypto there we go all right let's just get an overview of what's going on here the idea is that when a user signs up a new member will be created in member stack that will trigger an event that creates a new member item in the cms collection in webflow which will again create an event that passes back the webflow member id from the collection into the member in member stack in that way we have both systems nicely tied together but how do we do this let me present zapier a no-code tool that we can use to connect services on the internet let's go over to zapier and create a new account now let's create a new sap and call it webflow plus member stack sign up under app event let's search for member stack the event trigger we want is new member next zapier needs to be connected to member stack so let's go to power-ups then find api key under sapieu next let's create an action we're going to search for webflow here we're gonna pick create live item and also here we'll connect zapier with webflow but it should pick up from the account you're signed into so let's pick the site it'll be crypto view and the collection we call this members now for the email field we'll simply pick email from the event crypto assets will leave blank for the name let's just add the email again we could have created a form containing a field for a username but we're keeping it simple here and for this slug we want to use the member stack id it's simply called id that's it for the webflow action we'll actually add another action to the chain right away because we want to now update the member in member stack so we'll pick update member and we want to update the member based on the id we got from the newly created member so we'll pick the id here now we want to add the webflow member id here so we'll pick from the member collection item we just created and choose the id field and for the member page we want to use the id of the member stack member and that's basically it let's turn this sap on and test out the whole thing so we're gonna sign up for new user we can see the memory got created in you can also see that the sap added a webflow member id and added a unique slog for our member page awesome let's go to our webflow cms collection and see there's a new member looks good let's just double check the slog has the same id as the member page yes and the item id from this item became the webflow member id and members deck yes so that's it webflow and member stack are now totally in sync using sap here isn't that just freaking awesome so at this point we can create a user subscribe to a paid plan and log in to see a part of the website that is gated behind a paywall and so far we haven't written a single line of code in order to make this work in real life all we have to do is add stripe payment which is super easy to do directly from member stack it's absolutely incredible but we're not done yet we still need to add some actual functionality to this sas which includes storing user data in a database i will cover all of this in part two of this video which i will publish very soon so you definitely want to
