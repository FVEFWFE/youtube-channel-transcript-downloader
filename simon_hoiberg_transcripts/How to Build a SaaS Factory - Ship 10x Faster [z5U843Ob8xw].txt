================================================================================

welcome to my SAS Factory this is where I built my SAS product I used this place to create eight base feed hiive link drip and a lot of other products you haven't even heard of this seems broken SAS became really competitive let's face it going all in on a SAS is risky constantly testing the market with new ideas is the best way to increase your chances of success but you need the right tooling to do this sustainably and in this video I'll show you how you can build a SAS Factory just like this for yourself and I'll show you what to avoid at all cost the reality is that it is statistically overwhelmingly likely that your s product will fail if you're a beginner and it's your first product it's extremely likely almost a guarantee but even some of the biggest and most successful business owners are playing this game take a look at Amazon Google Apple Microsoft they all have a massive graveyard of failed product much much bigger than their portfolio of successful products if you take a look at the most successful Indie hackers it's the same deal the reason they're successful is that they've been pushing and failing more and faster than most other people and this is why you should build a SAS Factory to make it easier for you to test new new products launch new products and take new products to Market faster the first thing we need is a place to store code here let me show you in here we have a lot of packages containing a lot of code we have custom utilities that we use over and over packages to easily manipulate lists themes utility functions to handle common stripe operations and much more these are packages we install in mostly all new projects because they help speed up common operations such as login user permissions subscription workspaces managing teams and so on and we also have a lot of templates and boiler plates the tech stack this Factory is built on is using react chakra UI AWS and palumi and every new project we built comes out on the very same teex deack we have boiler plates that enable us to spin up a fully functional SAS including a backend front end authentication payment and a basic UI in less than 30 minutes all new products start from here the key is to stay organized in the Heat and excitement of building a new SAS people especially Indie hackers tend to under prioritize this in order to build this part of the factory you need just one thing a GitHub organization now get into the habit of stopping regularly go through your code and pick out pieces that you know or at least feel very sure could be reused re Factor it and turn it into a general purpose solution then push it to a repository on GitHub and turn it into an npm package you can install in future projects and try to think of future U be nice to Future U spend some time writing a nice read me with documentation and get started instructions the same goes for the boiler plates although these do take a bit more work and effort on GitHub you can turn a repository into a template and with a click of a button you'll have a new repository ready using the boiler plate with our full stack SAS boiler plate we even created a small CLI so when we first start a project we're taking through a few questions and choices and boom the new SAS is ready soon enough you will have a GitHub organization filled with packages boiler plates gists code Snippets starter guides including all the things you need to set up a base for new SAS fast hey Simon yes what is it the latest SAS broke again it seems like the version of chakra is out of date can't you ask Devon to look into it he tried but he couldn't figure it out okay I I'll look into it thanks yes this takes time to set up and yes you do need to maintain this since you need to keep your packages updated and compatible with each other but trust me once this part of your SAS Factory is well developed and running you're going to save hundreds if not thousands of hours on probably the most expensive part of your SAS business engineering the next thing we need is a place for no code automation this is one of our most important rooms people have this idea that it's either code or no code but in order to build a proper SAS Factory you should have both we're using tools like sapure and make to perform a lot of backend operations that include third-party tools when we add new users to a retargeting list for Facebook and Google we we use no code automation when we segment users in a list for email drips we use no code automation when we write product updates and notion and push it to feed hiive to share on social media we use no code automation when new users sign up and we add the sale to a spreadsheet for financial planning we use no code Automation in fact we use no code automation for a long list of things that are not directly related to the back end of the app and includes third party tools and why not turn this into a library of no code templates that can be reused here's what a lot of you don't know sapier has an excellent integration platform that allows you to create custom Integrations and if you keep these private you don't need to have them approved by the SE your team you can create these completely free of charge and hook them up with your own apis and use them directly within your own sapure account so instead of spending hours setting up complex automation for every new SAS you built create a custom integration once and make it reusable any new SAS you buil build and this works perfectly with your GitHub packages and custom boiler plates for a new SAS all you have to do is install an mpm package use a custom sap and you're ready of course once again this will take time to learn and to set up initially that's the whole point of a factory it's timec consuming once and fast in the future all right now that we got both code and no code covered the next thing we need is the [Music] can someone come and clean up this mess I'm sorry about that uh we need to go downstairs to the creative library but first let me tell you about eight base eight base is an AI powered all-in-one support solution for your SAS it's one of the SAS product that was built in this Factory for this Factory by me and my team you see all SAS bars need customer support and with eight base we have covered whole thing you start by adding an AI chat bot to your website and your app which will serve as live chat support and direct access to your FAQ and health dis articles which you can create directly from a base you then build a custom ticket form using our no code for Builder to capture important information and help users with issues that are a bit too hard for an AI to solve finally you create an email inbox so you can receive and manage support emails from 8base 2 everything from one unified dashboard and of course you use a base to train custom AI models on your data your websites PDFs YouTube videos and so on integrating it into your app takes seconds and once it's live our team of AI robots will help you handle customer support without you getting involved in every single step a base is a part of my sasf factory it should be a part of yours too that's why we're giving our subscriptions at 50% off for the entire higher first year use the code Factory 50 and start your subscription today the link is in the comment below now back to the factory this is our creative library in here we store reusable images and Graphics we use these for thumbnails ad creatives graphics for social media and much more getting stuck creatively is horrible so instead whenever we need something new we just go in here and pick up a template we even have video templates and essential graphics for video editing for instance if you want to publish a new video demo or create a new video ad we use these as building blocks to speed up editing in order to build this part of the factory I suggest using figma for images and Adobe After Effects for essential Graphics in figma you can use components to create template Graphics these can include different variants of elements so you can compose new pieces of Graphics easily Additionally you can build up a library of reusable graphic Parts like fonts scribbl characters icons and much more in Adobe After Effects you can turn animations and clips into essential graphics and make each layer customizable too this makes it easy to reuse different pre-made clips and graphics and adjust them in Adobe Premiere when you edit and I feel like I'm repeating myself a bit here but do spend some time making this nice and organized for yourself building a SAS Factory is all about making your future life easier and if you really don't want to spend time setting all this up you can always buy a readymade Simon did you forget what happened to your old factory oh well I just thought that please don't make that same mistake again it took us ages to rebuild this place remember you're right you're right okay there's something I need to tell you this is not my first SAS Factory a while back I was in a hurry to get my first SAS started and I found this SAS Factory that was for sale I called the seller and apparently it was my lucky day so I went down there to meet him and this SAS Factory has everything available inside it absolutely does sight you can start printing SAS products right away and have your first product ready to tomorrow how about that that's amazing I'll I'll take it perfect sign you'll be very happy with your new SAS Factory wow I can't believe this is mine now but I had no idea how to operate this Factory the manual was extremely poorly written and nothing really made sense to me I was trying a bunch of different things to get my first SAS product ready but nothing was working I spent a ton of money on this things so I was getting very frustrated at some point I pressed some button and something went wrong and the whole place caught fire a few moments later and the whole thing burned to the ground it was terrible all the money and time I had spent wasted but at that very moment when I was the most demoralized I made a decision I was going to build a new Factory from scratch I started planning how my factory would work in details I knew this was going to take a lot of hard work and effort but slowly piece by piece I got my new Factory working and this time because I build it from scratch I knew it inside and out it was not going to fail on me this time we still need two things in order to run a successful SAS Factory the first is a protocol keep a checklist and a setup up requirements all new sass products need this should include things such as a payment system email system user authentication but also things like privacy policy terms and conditions and so on I suggest using a tool like notion for this save all your legal documents as templates and keep checklists for all parts of your SAS development every time you set up a new SAS make sure you can cross everything on the list consider this quality control and as part of doing protocol and quality check make make sure all parts of your SAS Factory are well documented and all processes are well described don't let yourself end up in a situation where you get confused and don't remember what to do finally you need a Playbook A playbook is something that goes beyond the factory itself it's a guideline a framework that outlines your practices and strategies a rule set you follow and use to plan and execute each SAS most successful serial entrepreneurs do exactly this if you look at some of the most successful Founders you'll notice that they tend to play the same game again and again if you look at most successful Indie creators it's the same thing I do this too look at how I launch and Market my products if you've been following my journey you've probably noticed that I follow the same Playbook too and this is the perfect opportunity to announce that you can now buy my playbook and my entire SAS Factory but I'm obviously not going to do that cuz I'm not some snake o salesman if I sold you my playbook I would probably make a lot of money and even if my playbook works for me it's highly unlikely that it's going to work for you and using someone else's Factory and expecting the same results is most likely going to end in disaster what truly gives you superpowers is the process of building the factory all the hard-earned lessons that make up the foundation you're building on that's what really makes a difference and it's not something you can buy so get started building your own sass Factory today thanks for watching
