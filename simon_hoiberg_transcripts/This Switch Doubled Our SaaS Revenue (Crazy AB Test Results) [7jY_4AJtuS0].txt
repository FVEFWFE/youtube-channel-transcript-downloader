if you're building a SAS you absolutely need to run AB test sooner or later it is one of the best most datadriven most scientific ways to improve your website copy your messaging your onboarding flows inab functionality and by the end of the day convert more users and make more money in my startup we always have test running either on our website in our ad campaigns or in the app itself and in this video I want to share some of the most impactful and most curious findings we've discovered by rigorously AB testing our products some of these increased our Revenue by 52% and some of these were just weird let me show you what I mean but first let's just get the definition straight what is AB testing exactly practically this means that we assign all visitors or users to a group group a or group b and present them with different versions We then measure how many people in each group take a desired action for instance creating a new account and compare the two results after the experiment ends there are are a number of different ways this can be set up and there are many tools available that can handle this for you without the need to code in our setup we're using JavaScript to run the experiment and amplitude to track the results so let's head over to the lab and go through some test results experiment number one a user onboarding flow on one of our products feed hiive which is a social media management tool we offer a 7day free trial for all new users to try out the tool we want to find out if forcing people through an onboarding flow before getting access to the tool will result in more users signing up after the trial than users who get access directly let's take a look at the variance when group a signs up they'll get access to the tool directly they can click around and they can explore the tool and they'll be prompted to take certain actions for instance adding a Social account when it's needed this is the experience 50% of new users will get when Group B Signs off they'll be forced through an onboarding FL low they'll be asked a few questions asked to add their social accounts in advance and they'll even have to put their credit card information and pick a plan before they get to see and explore the tool so which of these groups do you think will result in the most signups after the 7-Day trial A or B we actually ran this experiment multiple times in the past 2 years with someone's apart every time and the results are very consistent every time in fact we set up the exact same experiment for another product link drip and we see similar results here as well are you ready for it these are the numbers from the last experiment we did in group a 100% of users will finish the onboarding flow since the recent one 11% of these users will end up converting by upgrading to a paid plan after the trial so out of 100 new users we end up with 11 paying users in group a in group b only 22% of users will actually go through the entire onboarding flow we effectively lose 78% of all new users before they even get started however out of the users who do finish on boarding 59% of them will upgrade to a paid plan after the trial so out of a 100 new users we end up with 13 paying users in group b so 11 paying users versus 13 paying users it seems more or less like a tie right but here's the kicker and it's the same every time in group a the arpo or average revenue per user is $22 per month whereas in group b the arpo is $36 per month so out of 100 new users in group a we end up adding $242 Mr out of 100 new users in group b we end up adding $468 Mr so we have a clear winner here by forcing users through an onboarding flow we end up increasing our Revenue with 52% counter inuitive well that's exactly why we run AP tests the results here speak for themselves but why do you think this happens what's your theory you can't tell for sure my theory is that this has to do with what is known in psychology as the effort justification effect where a product is valued higher if you force people to invest initial time and dedication into it I also think the onboarding serves as a good filtering mechanism for more unserious users who clearly weren't that interested in paying for a solution to begin with but but that's my personal interpretation what do you think if you have a good idea please pause the video here and share it with us in the comments below I would love to hear your thoughts experiment number two social proof having social proof on your website is obviously super important I don't think we need to run an AB test to verify that in itself but is there such a thing as too much Social proof let me share the results of an AB test we ran on social proof in a very specific placement and that is the her hero section of our website let's take a look at the variants group a will be presented with a clean hero section focusing on the features and the values of the product there's less clutter and less information to digest at the first encounter Group B will be presented with the addition of these comments and ratings along with the rest of the hero section results are measured by the number of visitors who click any of the get started buttons near the hero which group do you think will take the win on this one is the social proof in the hero too much bordering to spammy or does it help create trust in our product nudging more users to give it a try there's not a ton of numbers to go through in this one the results are pretty clear ready in group a 9% of visitors click on the get started button and in group b 16% of visitors click on the button it might not seem like that big of a difference but fed's website gets almost 200,000 visits every month so that 7% increase does have a noticeable impact so for our our audience this additional social proof in the hero section does seem to help of course we also do have a full section on our website dedicated to social proof alone this has been proven to work well across any tool in any industry so if you don't already have a section like this I highly recommend adding one I'm using a tool called sja for this it's really cool you can include testimonials from pretty much anywhere and embed them directly on your website in a ton of different ways really awesome tool I'll leave a link in the description so you can check it out all right experiment number three the default selection for monthly versus yearly pricing on your landing page yep that sounds about right and if you think it sounds like a kind of weird thing to test too I don't blame you nonetheless we did end up testing this on our landing page you can switch between monthly and yearly pricing and we have as so many other tools at discount when you opt for paying yearly instead of monthly and on our team when we were read designing our website we got into an argument about whether to have the yearly pricing enabled as the default instead of the monthly pricing I wanted to have the yearly pricing on since this presented the discounted pricing point but our uix designer felt very strongly about having it set to monthly by default and of course just like you should end every grown-up arguments we did so by putting it to the test you probably figured out how to set up this experiment group a will be presented with the monthly pricing by default and Group B will be presented with the yearly pricing by default the results are measured by the number of users who click either one of these four buttons and I'm curious which one do you think will win this time if you think the answer is obvious I don't blame you because I've asked a bunch of people what they think will perform better and everyone seems pretty confident that they know though roughly half of everyone I ask thinks it's obviously option A and the other half thinks it's obviously option b just like I thought it was obviously option B let's just take a look at the actual results of the visitors in group a 133% click on the sign up button of the visitors in group b only 4% click the sign up button and not only that the visitors in group b also flick the switch back to monthly nine times more often than the visitors in group a so no discussion the winner is group a today we have the pricing presented with the monthly payment as the default on both feed hives and Link drips landing pages oh overall the majority of our get started clicks tend to not come from the pricing page at all so it might not have a huge impact on the final results but still interesting and definitely worth considering when you're designing your next pricing page finally let's take a look at experiment number four G2 badges on the landing page you've probably seen these G2 Awards on various other SAS websites already they fall a bit under social proof but we still wanted to test this in isolation initially we were a little doubt about how to actually test the performance of these badges so instead of trying to approximate their impact on signups we decided to see how much of a scroll stopping effect they had so here's how we set this up group a would be presented with a version without the G2 badges below the hero and Group B will be presented with five of our most recent awards from G2 below the hero we then have a JavaScript to detect how many visitors stop scrolling right around here we also track the clickthrough rate to see how many of the scroll Stoppers who actually click on these and sure enough there's a reason why these badges are so popular visitors in group b would stop scrolling five times more often than visitors in group a and on top of that the badges have a click-through rate of well around 6% it's not a lot but it's enough that we actually decided to upgrade our G2 account to a paid plan even though it's a bit pricey but we do believe it helps create trust and even though the scroll stopping effect doesn't say anything concl inclusive about the users that sign up it gives us a clear impression that this is something that grabs people's attention so these were four AB test that had a huge impact on our growth trust and performance on both our website and our product itself we also ran hundreds of ab tests with totally insignificant results in fact most test results are like that which can make it seem a bit redundant to even bother but every once in a while you'll discover something that truly makes a difference and it'll be way worth with it trust me and also remember that there are many factors at play here which can't be directly accounted for so before you go ahead and implement the results of these tests I highly recommend running your own AB test first go ahead and verify that our results are also the case for you I hope you got value from this video please give it a like And subscribe to my channel for more content like this I will see you soon for another video
