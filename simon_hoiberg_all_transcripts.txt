TITLE: I'm tired...
VIDEO ID: Ap2wvq7LVTc

================================================================================

I'm tired. I'm tired of handing over almost half of my revenue to Meta and Google cuz this is the reality of the business I'm running. I'm heavily dependent on running ads. And of course, it cost money to make money. I completely understand that. But the truth is things have changed. I remember back in 2022, almost 4 years ago now. At this time, VHive, my first startup, was still very new and it was slowly starting to pick up, but I had exhausted the reach I could get from my back then relatively small audience on Twitter. And this was when I discovered how powerful ads can be. Back then, no one was really talking about running ads. But I realized that a good piece of content mostly also works as a good ad creative that can be used to drive sales. So, I started repurposing some of my best viral Twitter posts related to the software I'm selling and ran them as ads on Facebook and it worked really well. At the same time, my YouTube channel was starting to pick up too. But instead of using every opportunity to promote my products in my YouTube videos, I figured why don't I just retarget my own viewers with video ads. then I can focus on sharing value in my videos and when I later hit people with an ad, I will already be a familiar face. And this worked phenomenally. The combination of Facebook and YouTube video ads made FeedHive take off hard in the beginning of 2023, going from around 10,000 MR to 60,000 MR in just that year. At the peak, I would spend 30 to $40,000 per month just on running ads and adding MR. But in 2024, reality hit. My ads just weren't converting that well anymore. Even though I tried to stay on top of the latest trends, recreate the formats, trying UGC ads, and so on and so on, the rorowass, the return on ad spend just kept going down. And in 2025, the whole thing became very clear. Two major movements massively disrupted the performance of her ads. One, YouTube Premium. YouTube dialed up the frequency of inv video ads on their platform to the point it became unbearable and at the same time they were promoting YouTube Premium their adfree experience pretty heavily. So everyone I knew myself included upgraded to YouTube Premium to get rid of the ads and as a result the only people left to see the ads on YouTube would be people with no money essentially. and it was very easy to see my YouTube video ads almost entirely stopped converting two AI slop. Now, I actually don't use Facebook a lot. I only log in to see how my ads perform. But when I do log in, I realize that the feed is now completely infested with AI slop. And I mean, not just AI generated content, but the sloppiest of slop. It's worse on Facebook than on any other platform. And I have a strong feeling that this is just pushing normal people off the platform. Our Facebook ads still perform, but not nearly as well as they used to. And you know what? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. I'm tired of giving these giant tech companies my money. Instead, I would much rather give them to you and help you get your first business going in 2026 or help you add another income stream to your portfolio. So, that's why I'm launching something new. Founder Stack Partners. If you've been watching my videos, you probably already know this, but I bundled my entire SAS portfolio, including FeedHive and four other tools, into one giant stack called Founder Stack. And we're selling access to this stack as a lifetime deal. That means you pay $1,299 once and then you own access to all of our tools forever. And with Foundersstack partners, we are now offering 25% commission if you can bring in a sale. Here's how it works. You go to partners.foundersstack.pro. You sign up for an account and you get a unique partner link. Share this link with your audience, your newsletter readers, your own YouTube viewers, whatever it might be. And for each sale, we will give you 25%. So, for example, you generate 10 sales a month. You earn 25% commission on those sales. We pay you $3,247. Or let's say you generate one sale a day. With 25% commission, that would be $10,67 per month. We have a handful of early partners doing really well on this program already. What we can see on the back end is that on average it requires 600 to 800 visitors to generate one sale. So this does require a bit of traffic, but if you sit on a source that can generate this type of traffic, this is an excellent opportunity. So I'm not going to stop running ads entirely, but honestly, I would much rather move that budget to you. I would rather pay a real human $300 for a genuine recommendation than burn through thousands of dollars just to feed an algorithm that gives me less and less in return. We're keeping the money in the community instead of handing it over to big tech. To me, that is just a much better business model. The system is ready. 25% commission is set. Now, the rest is up to you. Go to partners.founderstack.pro, Pro. Sign up, get your link, and let's see if we can beat the algorithm together. Thank you.

TITLE: 5 OS SaaS ideas to launch in 2026
VIDEO ID: H9YVvRkZnCo
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9YVvRkZnCo
================================================================================

There's a new movement happening in SAS and it's not AI. Founders are waking up. We're realizing that the convenience of big tech has come at the cost of our margins and our control. So, we're seeing a massive migration from the cloud back to bare metal infrastructure and open-source software. [music] So, instead of fighting over users in the AI space, there is now a big opportunity to capitalize on this movement. And in this video, I want to cover five SAS ideas in this space. I believe could be huge. If you're new to this channel, welcome here. I'm Simon Horberg and I run a SAS portfolio of five SAS tools. And if you're wondering why I'm here handing out SAS ideas for free instead of just building them myself, it's because I am. My SAS portfolio founder stack contains five SAS tools already. And because I work with SAS every single day, I get a ton of ideas I believe could have amazing potential. But obviously, I cannot build them all. So instead of keeping them to myself, I'd much rather talk about them here. So maybe you can take one of these ideas and [music] run with it. So without further ado, let's get to it. The first idea is an open-source affiliate marketing tool. Now, this one actually comes from a very real personal pain point. We recently launched the partner program for Founder Stack. And naturally, we needed a tool to handle affiliate links, tracking, and payouts. So, I tried a bunch of the most well-known tools on the market. And don't get me wrong, they're great tools, but they all had one major requirement that had me think again. [music] In order for these tools to work, you have to connect them to your Stripe account. You have to give them read access to your revenue, your customer emails, and your transaction history. [music] And honestly, I just wasn't comfortable with that. sharing that level of sensitive financial data with a third party tool just to track some clicks just didn't feel right. So instead, we decided to vibe code our own solution. It took us about a week and we now have a fully custom partner platform running on our own infrastructure. But it got me realizing something. If there had been a solid open-source affiliate tool that I could have self-hosted on my own server, I would have picked that in a heartbeat. And I think this is a massive opportunity for 2026. [music] First of all, it solves the privacy issue. You keep your Stripe keys and your customer data on your own database. No third party ever gets access to any of your sensitive data. And secondly, it solves transparency. A huge [music] issue with affiliate programs is trust. Are partners actually getting the payouts they've earned? And is the attribution logic fair? With an open source platform, this code would be public. [music] Your partners can inspect the logic and confirm that you are being honest with sales attribution. [music] That builds a level of trust that a blackbox says simply can't match. [music] Now, if I were to build this as a business today, I would structure the monetization in three [music] layers. One, a free community edition, fully open source. Anyone can fork it and host it. [music] This gets you distribution and makes it the standard. Two, a pro lifetime [music] license. you sell a supporter edition that comes with advanced features, maybe multi- teamam support or advanced analytics for a onetime fee. And [music] three, and this is the big one, a full done for you service. This would be the equivalent of a merchant of record, but specifically [music] for affiliate payouts. You offer service where you handle the tax compliance and the actual money transfer to the affiliates while a software runs on their server. I really think the market is begging for a solution like this. The second idea is an agentic QA tester. So, not long ago, I saw this tweet and it sparked [music] quite a bit of debate. But I'll be completely honest with you, I don't look at all the code the AI is generating anymore either. [music] In fact, I stopped asking the AI to refactor or optimize for human readability because I figured it's most likely an AI that will be reading and maintaining that code in the future anyway. Instead, I simply do manual QA on the solution that the AI built to see if everything still works. Though, I've noticed one thing. Having an AI go over another AI's work, sometimes even multiple times, drastically increases the quality of the code. So, why wouldn't this principle apply to the QA part, too? Imagine a tool where instead of writing all these comprehensive Cyprus or Playright tests that break [music] every time you change a tiny little thing, you just give the AI a mission. Go to the pricing page, select the pro plan, and make sure the checkout flow works. This agent would spin up a headless browser, look at the screen using computer vision, [music] and click through the application exactly like a human would. It solves the biggest [music] pain in testing, which is maintenance. You get the reliability of end-to-end testing without the nightmare of constantly keeping your testing logic up to date. Now, how do you monetize this? Well, this is the perfect candidate for a usage-based [music] pricing model. You are selling a junior QA engineer. So, you charge per test run or per agent minute or maybe just AI credits and then let the user top up. You could also offer a higher tier enterprise plan where the agent runs inside their own VPC. So unreleased products never touch your cloud. This is a massive compliance requirement for big tech and some companies will pay a premium for that privacy. Idea number three is what I call a shadow database tool. We all use these amazing no code tools to run our businesses. We use tools for our project management, for our CRM, and for our internal vickies. And the user experiences of these commercial products like Notion and Air Table are incredible. They are miles ahead of most open- source alternatives and certainly way ahead of anything we could ever build ourselves. But they all come with one massive downside. They own your data. If one of these platforms decide to double their pricing or if they decide to change their terms or worst case, if they decide to ban your [music] account, you are completely locked out. your business data is trapped inside their proprietary data stores. [music] This is the classic vendor lock trap. So the idea here is to build a data liberation engine. Think of it as a sync tool [music] that connects to the APIs of these SAS platforms and pulls your data in real time into a standard [music] raw Postgress database that you host on your server. Now you can still use the SAS product exactly as you do today. You're not replacing it, but you are creating a live readonly mirror of every single piece of data you create. It's effectively a data insurance against vendor lock. If the SAS provider ever becomes a problem or if they shut down, you don't just have a messy export dump. You have a structured SQL database with all your customers tasks and notes ready to be plugged into a new tool. This product would then have a bunch of different connectors to other popular platforms. So [music] if you were to move from notion to Monday, you would simply click a button and this tool would normalize your data from notion and then import it into Monday automatically. In terms of monetization, I would follow the open core model here. The core sync engine is free and open source. This gets you the trust of the developer community because they [music] can inspect the code and see that you aren't stealing anyone's data. But then you monetize on the connectors. Maybe the connectors for tools like notion or air table is free, but the connectors to Salesforce, SAP [music] or Oracle, the enterprise connectors requires a paid license. And of course, you can offer a managed cloud version where you host the shadow database for them for a monthly subscription. That's a very proven, very scalable business model. SAS idea number four is a self-hosted AI media studio. Right now, if you want to generate highquality AI images or videos, you generally have two options. You can go to platforms like Midjourney or Runway. These are completely closed ecosystems running their own proprietary models. Or you can use aggregators like Open Art. Now, Open Art is great because it lets you use and combine different models in one place. But their business model is based on credits. Essentially, they are reselling you the compute, but with a markup. You pay a subscription, you get a balance, and when it runs out, you pay again. But if we look [music] at the textbased AI world, we have this incredible tool called typing mic. If you haven't seen it, it's a beautiful UI that let you chat with GBT5, cla or Gemini. But instead of paying a monthly subscription for credits, you simply buy a one-time license for the software and then you plug in your own API key. This means you are paying wholesale prices for the AI inference directly to the provider. No markup, no middleman. We need this exact same model, but for AI video and images. The idea is to build a self-hostable UI that sits on top of AI pass providers like Replicate or Fell AI. It would be a studio tool that let you chain together the most popular models like [music] Flux or Nano Banana for images or cling or Pixieverse or Sora for video. You wouldn't be selling credits. You wouldn't be selling compute. You are simply selling the interface. The user brings their own API key from replicate. They pay replicate directly for the generation. You just provide an awesome UI workflow builder to combine these models. And in terms of monetization, this is a perfect [music] candidate for the lifetime license model. Just like typing mine, you sell the software for a onetime fee. For instance, $79 or $99. Since you don't have any server cost because the user connects directly to the AI provider, your recurring cost is effectively zero. It's pure software play. You build it once, you update it occasionally, and you sell the license forever. This is exactly the kind of low overhead, high margin business that is perfect for a solo founder in 2026. The last idea is unfortunately a bit more serious. One of my favorite YouTubers, Pat Walls from Starter Story, recently had a terrible experience with YouTube. Out of nowhere, his content started getting flagged [music] as dangerous. And he started receiving strikes on his channel. And as you know, after three strikes, YouTube doesn't just suspend you, they may delete your entire channel. Years of work gone overnight. He talked about this on Twitter. And as it turns out, it wasn't just him. This started happening to a bunch of business YouTubers seemingly due to some AI moderation error. Now, fortunately, I haven't experienced any of this myself, but seeing that happen to the starter story channel made me incredibly uncomfortable, and it is a harsh reminder that we cannot really rely on big tech for our businesses. We are building our houses on rented land. So, the idea is to build a self-hostable YouTube clone. I'm talking about a platform you can spin up on your own server that functions exactly like [music] YouTube. It handles the video hosting, the streaming, the quality adjustments, and it has a full UI for likes, [music] comments, and related video suggestions, and so on. Now, to be clear, this obviously cannot replace YouTube as a platform and the network. But it's a place where your viewers can go and watch your content if the unthinkable happens. [music] Place where you own the platform, you own the database of comments, and you own the subscribe button. In terms of monetization, this is the perfect creator economy tool. You could release the community edition for free, which just handles video hosting, perfect for personal archives or small channels, but then you could monetize by selling membership features as a paid license. This would allow creators to turn their self-hosted platform into their own version of Patreon or YouTube Premium. They can put their videos behind a payw wall, [music] connect their own Stripe account, and keep 100% of the revenue from their biggest fans. In 2026, creators are waking up to the platform risk. [music] Selling them the ultimate backup plan is, in my opinion, a very powerful value proposition. [music] Now, as you know, these are just ideas. They are completely worthless if you don't execute. And if you feel the analysis paralysis kicking in already, let me [music] help you out. Cuz in this video, I'm showing you how to build a niche AI SAS with lovable and replicate step by step. So take one of these ideas, go watch this video next, and then go build yourself a SAS.

TITLE: Can you ACTUALLY replace your team with AI? (Real talk)
VIDEO ID: EdeWN3whbgw
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdeWN3whbgw
================================================================================

A recent study from MIT came out and it reveals a brutal reality. 95% of AI initiatives fail to deliver any measurable value. That means only 5% of companies are actually succeeding in replacing human work with AI. So why is everyone hyping this idea that we can replace human work with AI? See, this made me curious cuz I'm one of the few who actually made it work. Over the last year, I reduced my own team from 11 people down to just three. And I replaced their work with AI. And while doing that, revenue went up, our output increased, and margins got better. So, I have to take some blame here cuz I'm one of the people who have been hyping this idea. I have published several videos showing you how to build AI agents, social media content writers, SEO blog writers, and AI support systems. I am actively contributing to this hype. But what I've realized is that replacing your team with AI seems to only work for a very specific type of company run by a very specific type of business owner. And if that's not you, making this move might be a terrible idea. So in this video, I want to take you through three checkpoints. These are filters that will help you answer the question, should I replace my team with AI? and if so, which team members should go first? If you're new to this channel, welcome here. I'm Simon Horberg and my team and I run a SAS portfolio of 5 SAS products. We used to be a small team, but now we're an even smaller team thanks to AI and automation. So, the first checkpoint is all about the DNA of your company. Is your business humanentric or process centric? A human ccentric business is run by people for people. The focus here is on culture, collaboration, and goal alignment. It's the type of company where you want every team member to feel heard. You have a flat structure. You involve everyone in key decision-making, and you spend a lot of time ensuring everyone is motivated and personally aligned with the company mission. Think of a creative agency, a hightouch consultancy, or typical startups where culture fit is just as important as the actual skills. In these environments, the value often comes from the friction and the chaos of human collaboration. If you try to replace this team with AI, you will rip the soul out of your company. AI doesn't care about your mission. It doesn't need to feel heard and it's terrible at nuanced cultural decision-m. On the other hand, we have the process ccentric business. This is a business that runs like a machine. It relies on vicks, guidelines, SOPs, and checklists. Here a team member is assigned a specific task with clearly defined requirements, a deadline and a set of dependencies. Decisions are made at the top by the business owner and the team is there to execute. My business has always been heavily processentric. Even before AI, the biggest selling point I had when hiring was we have no meetings, we have no ceremonies, you can work whenever you want as long as stuff gets done. But the flip side of that is we never really had much culture. I rarely involved the team in big strategic decisions and honestly I didn't require them to be passionate about the vision of the company. My team would care only to the extent they needed to understand the context of their work. And this is one of the reasons I was able to transition to AI so successfully because an AI agent loves a processcentric environment. It loves clear instructions. It loves SOPs. It loves checklists. It doesn't need a pep talk and it doesn't need a zoom meeting to feel included. So look at your business. Are you running a human- ccentric or a process centric company cuz if you are running a high culture human first organization you cannot replace your team. You can augment them but you cannot replace them. If you're running a processcentric company on the other hand you are in a much better position. Let's move on to checkpoint number two. This checkpoint is all about you, the founder. Are you a leader or are you an operator? We're often told that to be a successful CEO, you have to be a great leader. You have to be the person who rallies the troop. The one with the high empathy who makes everyone feel heard, resolve conflicts, and motivates the team to go above and beyond. Think of people like Steven Bartlett, Dan Martell, or Gary Vaynerchuk. These are incredible leaders. Their superpowers are empathy, communication, and culture building. But the idea that you have to be a great leader in order to run a company is not true because on the other side of the spectrum, you have the operator. This is the executive who gets things done. They are obsessed with systems, data, and logic. They are big on systems thinking and often, let's be honest, a little low on soft skills. The ultimate example I can think of is Elon Musk. If you listen to anyone who's worked close to him, they aren't exactly describing him as a great leader, but he is probably the world's best operator. He cares about the physics of the problem, the efficiency of the line, and the output of the system. In fact, usually a great operator is not a great leader and vice versa. This is why natural leaders often hire COOs or project managers to handle the systems and why natural operators often hire team leads to handle the people. And this part requires a bit of self-awareness and introspection. I'll admit I was never a natural-born leader. I consider myself a strong operator. I love building systems. I love optimizing workflows. But I've never enjoyed the people management side of things. the motivation, the conflict resolution, the emotional alignment, all of this. And generally operators like me end up running process-centric businesses while leaders end up running human-centric businesses. And this is the key. If you are an operator, AI is your dream employee. Because AI doesn't need empathy. It needs logic. It doesn't need motivation. It needs instructions. If you're a natural leader who thrives on personal connection, you will struggle to manage an AI workforce because you cannot motivate an AI. You cannot inspire an AI with a vision. You cannot take an AI out for a onetoone to resolve a conflict. So look at these last two checkpoints. If you're a leader running a human-centric business, you can stop watching right now. You should not try to replace your workforce with AI. In fact, you should go watch other videos on leadership and how to become an even better leader cuz that's where the true ROI is for you. But if you're an operator running a processcentric business, you are in the perfect position to replace your team with AI. But even if you have the right business and the right personality, you still can't just fire everyone randomly. You need to know exactly which roles to replace. So let's say you're running a processcentric business and you are an operator at heart. Does that mean you can just fire your whole team tomorrow? No, absolutely not. Because even inside a perfect system, there are certain roles that AI simply cannot touch yet. To figure out which roles you can replace and which ones you need to keep, I use a framework I call the RIP model. Honestly, no pun intended. That is what I call this framework. R stands for repetitive. This is the lowhanging fruit. Is the task identical every single time? Copying data from an email to a spreadsheet, formatting a monthly report, categorizing support tickets. If a human is doing this effectively like a robot, an actual robot will do it better, faster, and cheaper. The P stands for predictable. Is there a clear right or wrong answer? Write an SQL query that pulls active users from the database. There is a correct way to do that. But reply to our biggest enterprise client who is threatening to turn because of a server outage. This is not predictable. AI can write a polite apology, but it can't read the room. It doesn't know the specific client, and it doesn't know that he needs an honest phone call to be saved. AI thrives on formulas. It fails on nuance. But here's the real trap. Most founders do get the R and the P right, but they completely ignore I. I stands for isolated, and this is where 90% of AI implementations fail. Can the task be done in a vacuum or does it require tribal knowledge? I use AI to write code every single day. And AI is incredible at writing clean, highquality code. But AI assumes that your code base makes sense, which let's be honest, most code bases don't. That's why it will randomly refactor code, remove old functions, or delete an unused table in your database. It doesn't know that you have a random Zapier automation set up 2 years ago that reads that specific table in order to run your payroll. This is context. It is tribal knowledge. And AI is terrible at this. It doesn't know the history of your company. It doesn't know the invisible dependencies and it doesn't know why you made a weird decision several years ago. If a task requires deep integration with other moving parts of the business or deep historical context, it's not isolated. And if you try to replace that role with AI, the AI won't just fail. It will probably break things and make a big mess. You can only give AI a task that requires no prior knowledge about a specific thing or where that knowledge can be included in brief terms upon solving the task. So here's the rule. If a role handles tasks that are repetitive, predictable, and isolated, you can replace it today. If it misses even one of these, you have to at the very least loop in a human as a part of that workflow. So instead of thinking about replacing people, think about replacing tasks and apply the RIP model to figure out which ones. This is how you build a system. And this brings us right back to the brutal statistic from MIT. The reason 95% of companies fail to get value from AI is not because the technology isn't ready. It's because they are treating AI like a magic employee that can just figure things out instead of a machine that follows strict instructions. They are trying to replace leadership, tribal knowledge, and strategy with a chatbot. The 5% of us who are actually succeeding, we aren't doing that. We are acting as operators. We are stripping away the repetitive, predictable, isolated tasks and we are handing them over to agents so humans can focus on the things that actually require a pulse. Now understanding the theory is one thing. Actually sitting down and building real AI agents that pass the RIP test is a different story. And if you want to see exactly how that's done step by step, I recorded a full breakdown where I built a news research agent. It creates a perfect isolated workflow that does the work of a human researcher. And you can watch the video right here.

TITLE: How cloud providers overcharge you (and how to fix it)
VIDEO ID: 3XGIU17mZFo
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XGIU17mZFo
================================================================================

I'm convinced that cloud providers are designed exactly like casinos. The architecture, the UI, and specifically the pricing models. They're all engineered to make you lose track of how much you're actually spending. It's never one big purchase. It's a fraction of a cent here, a tiny data transfer fee there, and before you know it, you are bleeding thousands of dollars a year on resources you don't even use. I spent the last week auditing my own infrastructure and I found six specific traps. These are sneaky default settings and misleading pricing structures that providers like AWS and Versel use to inflate your bill without you noticing. Today, I'm going to show you exactly what they are and how to fix them. The first trap happens on AWS. I call this the Cloudatch buildup trap. Here's what happens. You spin up a new resource. It could be a Lambda function, an RDS instance, or maybe a new ECS cluster. Automatically, AWS creates a Cloudatch lock group associated with it. Now, here's what many people don't realize. The default retention policy for that new lock group is always set to never expire. And AWS is billing you for logs in two ways. You pay to ingest the data, but you also pay a monthly fee for every gigabyte stored. And because the default retention policy is set to never expire, that storage cost accumulates forever. You're literally paying monthly rent for gigabytes of old text logs from Lambda calls that happened years ago. And over time, this actually becomes pretty significant. So if you like using Cloudatch to search through your logs, the easiest way to fix this is to simply change the retention period to something like 5 or 7 days, whatever works for you. But if you're anything like me and you think Cloudatch is a terrible user and developer experience, there's an even sneaker and much more aggressive way to fight this. Set up Grafana on a cheap self-hosted server or VPS. Create a Cloudatch data source in Grafana and configure this to pull your log groups at an interval, for instance, every 30 seconds. This will move all of your logs to your own server which you can host for a fraction of the cost and make all the logs available through Graphana which in my opinion is a much better experience. Now go back to Cloudatch on AWS and set the retention to one day. There you go. You made your life more pleasant and you're saving a bunch of money at the same time. And if you want to double down, set up a cron job in GitHub actions to occasionally run through all regions, find all log groups, and update the retention period on all of them, just in case you created a new resource and forgot to do this manually. The second trap is what I call the bandwidth trap. We all want our landing pages to look slick. So, you decide to add a highquality looping background video in the hero section or a promo video to showcase your tool. The file is only 10 megabytes, so you committed to a repo and push to production. No big deal, right? Well, this is where data egress fees come in to kill your margins. Let's do the math. If just 1,000 people visit your site, that little 10 megabyte file turns into 10 GB of data transfer. If you go viral and get a 100,000 visitors, that is a terabyte of data. Now, if you're hosting on a platform like Versel, their pro plan gives you 1 terbte included. But the moment you cross that line, they charge you $0.15 for every extra gigabyte. That bill scales up pretty fast and it's just a terrible way to burn cash. The quick fix here is to upload that video to YouTube or Vimeo and just embed their player. I'm doing that on one of my websites. It works pretty well and you're essentially letting Google pay your bandwidth bill. Though, if you want that clean native HTML video element, here's a better way to do it. host your heavy assets on Cloudflare R2. Unlike S3 on AWS or other big providers, Cloudflare R2 charges you exactly $0 for egress bandwidth. You only pay a tiny amount for the storage itself. So in this way, you can get the performance of a global CDN, the clean look of a native video tag, and you completely bypass the bandwidth trap, which leads me to the third trap, what I call the optimization trap. If you're using Nex.js, XJS, you probably use their magic image component. You know, the one that automatically resizes and compresses photos for every device size. But here's the thing. Platforms like Bracel charge you for those image optimizations. And their limits are actually pretty low, something like a,000 transformations. If you run a directory site or website with a lot of images, you will blow through that quota in days and suddenly you are paying premium prices just to show pictures. Now, I know the standard advice is to configure a custom loader or tweak the settings, but honestly, my fix is simple. Stop using the image component and just use the standard HTML image tag. Instead of relying on the server to resize images on the fly, simply save your images as WEBP files at a reasonable oneizefits-all resolution. This serves a high quality image that looks great on both desktop and mobile, and it doesn't touch Versel's processing limits at all. Now, I know lighthouse score, web vitals, blah blah. The obsession with microoptimizing load speeds has been completely blown out of proportion. We're now living in the world of 5G and fiber internet. The difference in load time between a perfectly optimized responsive image and a standard WEBP file is probably unnoticeable to your users. And Google's penalty for unoptimized images is completely blown out of proportion to. I'm firmly convinced that highquality content outweighs a fraction of a second in load time. So write a simple script that uses Shark to batch convert your entire media folder to WEBP during build time. You get 90% of the optimization benefits, but with 0% of the recurring cost or vendor lock. The fourth trap is what I call the region premium trap. This isn't a super common one, but it does happen. And most cloud providers like AWS, you pick a region. And naturally, most people just pick the city that is physically closest to where they live. If you're in the UK, you pick London. If you're in Brazil, you pick S. Paulo. If you're in South Africa, you pick Cape Town. But here's the mistake. Cloud pricing is not global. It's local. Because of higher taxes, electricity cost, and infrastructure challenges, servers in places like S. Paulo or Cape Town can be up to 50% more expensive than the exact same servers in the US. So unless you have strict legal requirements that force you to keep data within your country's borders or you're building a tool where every millisecond counts, just pick US- East. I literally pick US- East one for almost all of my products. This is almost always the cheapest region available. For 99% of SAS applications, the latency difference is negligible, but the savings on your monthly bill can be quite significant. If you're in the EU and you want your data processing agreement to say that your data centers are in the EU, you may want to pick one of the EU regions, though. But as far as I know, AWS actually can't guarantee that data strictly stays in that region anyway. So, not sure if it solves anything really. The next trap is what I call the NoSQL hype trap. There's this massive narrative in the tech world that you need to be serverless and use databases like DynamoB. And honestly, I thought so too for a long long time. I thought it was super convenient that I didn't have to worry about how my databases were hosted. They were just there, always available and with backups running automatically. But the downside is Dynamob and other serverless databases charge you per operation. So every time you read, every time you write, every time you query or scan, you're charged. And this is only financially viable if your data structure is perfectly optimized for specific access patterns. And you often have to use complex strategies like single table design to make that math work. And the reality for us founders is that we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. We pivot. We add new features. We change how we want to display data. At the moment your query needs change, your perfectly optimized NoSQL database kind of loses its purpose. You end up running inefficient scans and queries and it just end up costing a lot of money. At some point, you may even feel inclined to avoid certain features or to sacrifice good user experience just to avoid making too many reads or writes. The fix is simple. Stick to boring technology. Use Postgress or MySQL. SQL is much more forgiving. You can pivot your products, add new features, and query your data in ways you didn't plan for without having to worry about how it affect costs. And best of all, you pay a flat monthly fee for the server box. It doesn't matter if your queries are messy or complex. The price is the same. The final trap is what I call the zombie resource trap. This one is extremely common because of how cloud providers decouple their services. For instance, they treat the computer, the hard drive, and the load balancer as three completely separate products. So, here's the trap. You decide to shut down your project to save money. You go into the console and delete the server instance, and you think you're done, but you're not. Often, the load balancer does not get deleted with the server. It stays behind because it's no longer attached to anything. doesn't show up on your main dashboard, but you're still paying about $18 a month for a zombie load balancer that is routing traffic to absolutely nowhere. To fix this, you need to stop clicking around through random tabs to find things. Go to the search bar and type tag editor. It is inside the AWS resource groups. In the settings, set regions to all regions. Set resource types to all supported resource types and hit search. This gives you a full list of every single item currently alive in your account. Scroll through that list. If you see a load balancer or hard drive volume or any other resource for a project you thought you deleted, kill it immediately. If you're setting up a whole bunch of resources, I can highly recommend using an infrastructure as code tool like AWS CDK. This makes it much easier to keep things organized, and it saves you from a lot of clicking around the UI, and it's much easier to clean up all the resources and dependencies using a single command. If you've been watching my videos for a while, you probably noticed that I changed things up a bit here in my last few videos. I simplified my studio and relaxed the editing a bit, but I also changed the software I'm using. I used to do all of my videos using Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects, but I recently changed to Da Vinci Resolve. And honestly, I'm blown away by the quality of this software that I always saw as a bit of an underdog. So, instead of paying an expensive monthly fee to Adobe, which, let's face it, are known for using some pretty aggressive and predatory practices, I made a one-time purchase and got this new software, Da Vinci Resolve, which is arguably a much better tool. And I'm honestly kind of embarrassed that it took me so long. And it got me thinking generally, not just specific to cloud providers or editing tools, I think we should try looking for the underdog a bit more often cuz I really think it's insane how much value we can get for much less just by not defaulting to these huge established companies. And in all honesty, it's how I try to position myself as well with my tools. That's also why on my main website, I put my tools right next to these big established tools. So, it's super clear what my tools are aiming to replace and how much more affordable they are. And I'm biased, of course, but I honestly believe that the tools my team and I built are simply much higher quality products. And we do have a lot of testimonials confirming that, too. This isn't a political channel, so I'm not going to get deep into this, but I personally think that we got a bit lazy and that we're slowly allowing a small handful of mega corporations to basically build monopoly. And one small thing we could do is instead of just defaulting to these three big companies we already heard of when we have a new problem, maybe spend just a little time scratching a little deeper and see if you can find a lesserk known alternative. In this way, we can spread out where revenue goes a bit more and in most cases actually end up with a much better solution to whatever problem we had. So, just a small encouragement from here to try to support the underdog a bit more often. So, here's my challenge to you. Don't just click away from this video. Open your AWS console or your Versell dashboard right now. Audit those logs. Check those regions. Kill those zombie resources. And if you go through this list and realize that the cloud has become too much of a headache, well, maybe it's time to pack your bags. I recently published a full breakdown of why I left the cloud entirely and moved to self-hosted servers. You can watch that one right here.

TITLE: I'm leaving the cloud! (...and why you probably should too)
VIDEO ID: tWz4Eqh9USc
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWz4Eqh9USc
================================================================================

Until recently, all of my SAS products were running entirely on AWS. But at the beginning of this year, I started moving everything to run on dedicated bare metal servers hosted by a small German company called Hzner. 80% of my systems now run on dedicated servers using open-source software [music] with only about 20% left in the cloud. And this has been a truly pivotal moment for [music] my business. Not only that I see a dramatic cost reduction, but my products also run faster. My team and I deploy new features faster and it's opened new business opportunities I wouldn't otherwise have. But moving off the cloud certainly comes with downsides as well. So the question is, was it worth it? And should you take your SAS off the cloud and start self-hosting, too? In this video, I'll share the top three reasons why I'm moving off the cloud. I'll show you my exact self-hosted setup and I'll share which services I'm keeping on AWS and probably won't ever self-host. If you're new to this channel, welcome here. My name is Simon Hoyberg and I run a SAS [music] portfolio of five SAS tool which is used by more than 50,000 users and is about to hit $2 million in ARR this [music] year. And before we get into the reasons why I chose to move these tools off the cloud, let's just get a [music] quick overview of how this new setup looks. So this is how I used to run my products. I would use ECS, Fargate, and Lambda functions to run all of my code. I would use AWS Amplify to host my apps. I would use Dynamob to store all my data. I would use SQS to run my message cues. And I would use Cloudatch to monitor the systems and access logs. [music] And I don't think I have to sell you the benefits here. All of this is entirely managed by AWS. I don't have to worry about where and how this runs. I just know that it runs and AWS will build me for my exact usage. [music] So I'm built for exactly how many milliseconds my code takes to execute, how many times I read or write to my database, for how long I store my logs, and so on and so on. Now let's take a look at the new setup. I now have three dedicated servers with Hzner. All my code now runs in Docker containers and is managed by Kubernetes. I use Postgress to store my data. I use Reddus for caching. I use Bullmq to run my message cues. And I use Graphana and Prometheus to monitor the systems and access logs. And the pricing model here is completely different from AWS. Kubernetes, Postgress, Reddis, Bullmq, and Prometheus are open- source and free. Graphana has a free community edition and it offers more than enough. So the only thing I pay for are the three dedicated servers I have with Hadster [music] and this comes with a low fixed monthly cost. On the other hand, I now need to manage all of this myself. So, this is what I mean when I say we're leaving [music] the cloud. I know I'm using the word a little loosely here. We're still renting servers at a data center. So, we're not really self-hosting as in we have our own servers in our own house. So, what I mean is that we're moving away from managed serverless infrastructure and instead managing our own dedicated servers. So, why would I make this decision? Well, it probably won't come as a huge surprise that one of the top three reasons is cost. At the beginning of 2025, I would pay AWS 7,800 per month on average to run my SAS products. Because I pay per usage with AWS, this average is slowly climbing month after month as my user base grows. After moving more than 80% of my infrastructure to run on dedicated servers, this cost is now below $2,000 per month and it's likely to go even further below $1,000 per month as we're wrapping up the last migrations. The cost of running my service on Headstone itself is around $200 per month. The rest of the cost is the remaining 20% of infrastructure I still run on AWS. And that sounds amazing, right? We can save money. But in all fairness, let's just get a bit of perspective. My products are generating more than $100,000 per month. Is $7,800 for the servers really that big of a deal? And what about all the time I've spent this year migrating all of these systems from AWS to Hzner and having to learn about Kubernetes, Docker, and basic system admin stuff, which was all pretty new to me. If I factor in the time spent, is there really that big of an ROI here? Is this actually a financially sound [music] decision? Well, let's take a look. The time I spent doing infrastructure related stuff absolutely spiked at the beginning of this year compared to the previous years on AWS. This was valuable time I could have spent marketing, growing and improving my products instead. However, as I started to learn and as AI got better at helping me, the time spent on this type of work slowly came back to more reasonable levels. And while the whole promise of the cloud is to manage servers for you, time spent on dealing with AWS infrastructure still isn't zero. In fact, it can get very complex and there's certainly a learning curve here as well. So now after an adjustment period, the time I spent dealing with infrastructure is back to the same levels, if not even less than it was before. And assuming it's going to stay that way, the money I save on this is going to increase month after month after month without a ceiling. So yes, unless you're already an expert on this, there's obviously going to be an upfront cost in terms of time spent, but that upfront cost is fixed. And I have a feeling that most people who are afraid of going self-hosted thinks that the effort it takes to maintain this somehow stays up here all in the red. In my experience, it really doesn't. The cost savings, on the other hand, are potentially unlimited [music] and will just keep going up. So, one thing is the cost savings, but there's another and to me much more important reason. All of those services I mentioned, DynamoB, Lambda, Fargate, and so on, they're all really good, robust, battle tested products in terms of performance and reliability. They're great, and I honestly think their pricing is pretty fair, but they're all AWS services. They don't run anywhere else. If AWS were to raise their prices or decide they don't want you as a customer anymore, well, you're cooked. Your products just stop running. And migrating isn't something you can do quickly. It requires careful planning. And if you're forced to do that in a rush, yeah, that might mean your whole business goes in the dumpster. Honestly, users aren't going to wait around. It's what we call a vendor lock. And it's absolutely something you should avoid. It's not in the interest of AWS or Azure or Google Cloud Platform to have you easily [music] leave. And this is probably the biggest reasons to consider leaving the cloud. I'm super happy using Hner to run my infrastructure. But with my new setup, I can run it just about anywhere. Any hosting company that offers a VPS or a dedicated server can run my products. I'm not locked in in the same way. And I'm being a little bit crazy, but to really hammer this point home, I actually ran one of my products for two whole days on these three Raspberry Pies right here in my office. Now, that's not ideal. The internet here isn't fast enough, and I kept hitting memory issues. But I did this with a smaller product of mine, and I honestly [music] don't think any of my users even noticed. And I did this for fun, but also because it was satisfying to prove to myself that my products really can run [music] anywhere using this setup. I wouldn't recommend using Raspberry Pies for this, obviously, but I absolutely would recommend removing as many hard dependencies on specific vendors as you possibly can. There's just something about that feeling that you own your setup fully. Now, after moving off AWS, I still have at least two major dependencies left. Stripe and Open AAI, but I am actively looking into how I can mitigate this too. I'm looking into Coinbase as an alternative payment method and I'm experimenting with running our AI on dedicated GPU instances from more independent vendors. It's not a simple task though. And the last reason for me to move off the cloud is, I would say, a little bit more specific to my situation, but something you probably could consider for your products [music] too. It has to do with how my products are offered. As I mentioned earlier, I run a portfolio of SAS products and they all come with a monthly or yearly [music] subscription, but at the same time, I'm also selling access to all five tools on a lifetime deal. This means that you [music] can pay once and then use the tools forever. And selling something for a one-time purchase that has ongoing rising cost is obviously super [music] problematic. Selling software in a lifetime deal which have ongoing operational cost is totally possible. But if you can at least make those ongoing cost fixed instead of gradually rising as the number of users goes up, it's obviously going to be much easier and much less risky to do proper [music] financial planning when offering a deal like this. And at the same time, I do have users asking, "How can you guarantee that you can keep running this business? And what happens to our so-called lifetime deals if [music] your business goes down? And it's a totally legitimate question that I currently have a hard time giving a good answer to other than, "Don't worry, my business is doing well and it's not going to go down." That's [music] obviously not a very satisfying answer. And for that reason, I'm working on making all of my [music] products fully self-hostable. So, everyone who bought lifetime access to my software can, in the unlikely event that my business won't be able to host it, simply install it on their own servers and host it themselves. This is the best way I can guarantee that lifetime access really does mean lifetime access. All right, so we talked about the reasons why I'm doing this and we talked about the setup, but as I mentioned, I still have 20 or so% of my infrastructure that still runs on AWS, and I'm actually not sure if I can ever get these migrated, but let me share what they are and what I've tried [music] so far. So, first of all, storage. I use S3 for this, and it was rather difficult to find a good replacement. [music] Hester now has storage buckets and I know Cloudflare has something called R2 which is their version of S3. Both of these are S3 compatible which means [music] that they use the same API structure as S3. They're also both a fair bit cheaper than S3 but honestly the cost of storing data on S3 isn't really that big of [music] an issue. It actually doesn't cost that much. My main issue here is again the vendor lock [music] and neither headers or Cloudflare solutions are going to solve that. They locked me in [music] just as much. And so this is when I heard about Min.io, which is an open-source S3 compatible optic store [music] that you can install on your system and host yourself, which sounds perfect. So my approach was to order a 15 TBTE hard drive with Hzner and have them attach that to the main dedicated server and then use that with Minio. And actually, it worked [music] kind of, but it got a bit complicated to deal with backups. And the way Minio is built is kind of meant to be using a distributed system. So ideally, you would need to have multiple of these hard drives for each node in your system. And yeah, it got a bit complex and it wasn't very stable. Probably a skill issue, but I went back to S3. The next one is user authentication. This whole time I've used Cognto user pool on AWS, [music] which is similar to Ozero. Basically, a service that allows you to handle user authentication with all the security built-in. This is a highly sensitive point due to security. So, it's one of the areas where you really should be cautious. I tried one open source alternative which I believe is the only one really and it's called Keycloak [music] and I'm sure it's great. It's just I think this was done by some pretty hardcore [music] Java developers and both user experience and developer experience was so bad. And since this is such a critical point in any system, you really don't want to mess this one up. So I simply chose to go back to AWS and continue using Cognito. [music] And finally I use AWS CloudFront as the public entry point which proxies all requests to my Hner service. So that means that all incoming traffic to my Hner server is protected by [music] default and has to go through CloudFront. And that's simply because CloudFront offers a lot of security, firewalls, DDoS prevention and a lot of other things I wouldn't know exactly how to install myself. And for now, we still rely on services like OpenAI, Replicate, and Vast AI to run anything related to AI. Though, I'm really hoping standalone servers will soon come with the GPU power needed to offer reliable AI inference in a self-hostable way. If you have a lot of experience with this, I would love to get your recommendations in the comments below. How would you approach getting these last 20% off the cloud? Or [music] is it even doable? Please share your take. I'm very eager to learn more about this and see if it's possible to stretch it even further that I've done already. Now, the biggest question is should you move away from the cloud and build your next product off the cloud? [music] Well, I think it depends on where you're at. If you're here building a small hobby project and you don't expect it to become much more than a hobby project, then you should stay on the cloud. [music] Use Versel, Netleifi, Blobable, or any of these one-click deploy [music] types of tools. If you're here on the other end of the spectrum and you're expecting to build a really big business that needs very serious scaling capabilities or a business that is [music] absolutely missionritical to your users, then using a managed hyperscaler platform like AWS is the way [music] to go. But if you're anywhere on here somewhere in the middle, it makes perfect sense to consider leaving the cloud and using dedicated servers instead. It is absolutely doable to manage your infrastructure yourself. And there is serious money to be saved here. Now, one thing is the tech stack that powers your products. But another huge win from running onrem is that you get to benefit from some of all the amazing open-source tools that you can use internally to run your business. I have a video where I break down how I was able to save another $10,000 per year by replacing some of my most expensive tools with self-hostable alternatives. [music] You can watch that one right here.

TITLE: Get rich building niche AI SaaS (...not another ChatGPT wrapper)
VIDEO ID: QIA9Ry42Lbs
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIA9Ry42Lbs
================================================================================

This is what most founders are doing right now. &gt;&gt; They're all building the same open AI rappers and competing for demand. But instead, this is what you should be doing. Build niche AI solutions for small but carefully targeted group of people. When you say AI today, most of you think about Cad GBT, Gemini, and Clock. But in reality, there are thousands, in fact millions of small, super specialized AI models available to use, and many of them are free and open source. By fine-tuning, combining, and chaining specific models, you can solve many different niche problems for a small group of users and turn it in to a thriving business. Sounds complex? Well, you need a bit of technical understanding, but in reality, you can put a SAS like this together using just a few tools, and you can do it without having to code. In this video, I'll show you how to approach this step by step. So, here's the problem I set out to solve. My team and I produce a lot of video content, but I can't stand generic stock videos like the ones you find on pixels. On the other hand, shooting custom B-roll for every video is really timeconuming. So, I wanted a SAS that could create highquality AI generated B-roll clips with me in it simply giving a description in natural language. And that's exactly what we're going to build in this video. a small SAS tool where you can upload images of yourself, use it to create an AI character of yourself, then use that character to create AI generated B-roll clips. So, this SAS is solving a problem I have myself and I know a few other people who have the same problem, but it's not a big market and that's the whole point. We're building a niche solution for a small group of people here. I suggest you do the same. Use the principles I'm about to show you, but find a problem you have and try to solve that for yourself first. Let's get started. Let's do a quick architectural breakdown. A product like this will have three layers. The first layer is a front end. This is the part the user will be using. We'll use lovable to vibe code this part. The second layer is a back end. This is where we'll store items in a database such as characters and B-roll clips. We'll use Superbase for this part. Finally, the last layer is our AI engine. We need a place to host and run our AI models. We'll use replicate for this part. So, let's get started with the front end. Head over to lovable.dev and we'll give it a very highlevel prompt to begin with. No functionality yet, just the UI. And after running for a bit, it will set up a new project for us. Awesome. We now have the UI for uploading images and creating a new character. We also have some basic UI for generating a clip and a basic history page. I think the design is pretty on point. I'll take it. Now, as mentioned, we need both a front end and a back end. And for the back end, we're going to use Superbase. And here's the great news. Lovable now has a native superbase integration, what they call Lovable Cloud. So we can now handle both the front end and the back end through Lovable, which makes things a whole lot easier. So let's just go ahead and click connect Lovable Cloud. Then enable cloud here and then allow Lovable to set it all up. And now if we click the cloud button up here, we'll see that we have all these things available in our project. These are all the things that make up our back end. Awesome. So far so good. Now, the way this SAS works is by uploading a bunch of images in a zip file in order to create a character. Now that we have the backend set up, let's have Lovable create this functionality for us. We're going to give it this prompt. [Music] And here we'll see Lovable ask for permission to update some stuff on the cloud including a database table and storage. We'll allow this and all of our backend stuff will be set up. Lovable and Superbase comes with user authentication built in and it's very easy to set up. So you can do that now if you want to or for building the PC you can simply tell Lovable to just assume a mock user for now. That's what I'll do. Perfect. Now, after a bit of working, we should have a form that we can use to create a character and upload a SIP. Okay, seems to work. Let's just verify. If you go to the cloud section here, then go to storage, and then there should be a folder for our mock user. And there we go. The zip was uploaded. Perfect. Now, this is probably a good time to make a quick note that with these types of AI coding tools, things don't always go as smoothly as they just did here. In many cases, something won't work, and you'll be going back and forth with Lovable for a bit until things play nicely. But it's totally normal and not very different from how things would flow if you were working with a team of human developers. So, just keep in mind that this is an iterative process and some patience is required. Now, let's move on to the fun part. We need to set up the chain of AI models we'll use for this SAS. Let's get an overview. When a new character is created, we want to trigger a training job. This will use the uploaded images to create a custom image generation model that can generate new images with the character in them. This process is called fine-tuning. Then, when a new B-roll clip is created, we chain two models. The custom image generation model will generate an image. The image is then fed to a video generation model and used as the starting frame for the clip. We will do this on replicate. So head over to replicate.com and create a new account. Here we'll use the fastflux trainer model to fine-tune our custom image generation model. And we'll use clingv 2.1 to turn an image into a video. And I know all this might sound complex, but don't worry cuz lovable already knows how to use the replicate library and intuitively does a great job in wiring this together. And I'll show you how. in our replicate dashboard. Let's go get the API key. And back in the cloud section of Lovable, let's go to secrets and add that API key here. We're also going to take the replicate username, which is the one you'll see up here, and give that to lovable under secrets, too. Good. Let's ask Lovable to use the replicate API to start training our model. This is the prompt we'll give it. And as you can see, we're given Lovable a few technical details here. And again, Lovable will probably ask you to allow it to create some database tables and update security policies and so on. Just let it do its thing and it will set up everything for you. And if you don't know any technical stuff like this, don't worry. With Lovable, you'll get there eventually. It would just take longer and require more patience. So, giving these AI coding tools some technical descriptions really does help a lot. So, try to do that if and whenever you can. Awesome. Now hopefully maybe with a bit of back and forth you'll have something like this. So we can now create a character and it will start training that character on your images and replicate under the trainings tab. We should now see our flux trainer running. After a few minutes, the character will finish and the UI will update like this. Awesome. And in Replicate, we can verify this by clicking over to the models tab. Here we should see our new custom model. Perfect. The first part of our SAS is now working. Now, if we go to the generate B-roll page, we currently have a form that looks nice but does nothing. This is the next part we need to tell Lovable to implement. So, first we want to get the configuration for the image model. And the easiest way to do this is to simply test it out on replicate first. So we're going to add our test prompt here. We'll use a 169 aspect ratio. And since we want a bit higher quality images, let's increase this to around 40. PNG full output quality. And let's run it. All right, there we go. Looks good to me. So, let's click over here and we can simply copy all these configurations. Perfect. Now, let's use this and give Lovable a big prompt here. We'll give it the configurations here. And again, it's good to remind Lovable how replicates API works so it can implement a proper polling mechanism. All right. Again, you might have to do a little back and forth with Lovable if this step doesn't work from the get- go, but you should get to a flow that works something like this. We choose the character from the list. We give it a prompt. We can give it a style, though, I don't actually think this does anything yet. And finally, let's run it. And there we go. Perfect B-roll clip of our character, which is me in this case walking in an office. Awesome, man. Just super cool. And if we go to replicate and click the predictions tab, we should be able to see these two predictions from the API. The one from the custom image and then the one from cling. Looks like it's working perfectly. And one thing I absolutely love about lovable is how good it is at filling in the gaps. We have toast messages, spinners, various disabled and loading states, progress bars, and so on and so on. I didn't ask for any of that. Lovable simply figured that we probably would want that. Before AI, we'd have to manually sit and code all of that stuff, and it would take forever. And if we would use a development agency, we would have to explicitly ask for all of that, which for a lot of non techch founders just isn't something they think about. So they'd get this super halfbaked product back because that's what they ask for. Lovable does this extremely well and I think it's such a cool experience. Finally, let's create the history page. This one should be very straightforward since everything is set up now. And finally, you'll have a history page like this where you can see all your previous clips. And if we go to the cloud section in Lovable, we'll see that we now have a database with two tables in it. We have a storage bucket for the zip files and we have a bunch of these cloud functions. This is basically backend code. Lovable created all of this for us and we didn't have to touch any code at any point. Now, we also notice that we get this warning. This is because we didn't implement user authentication earlier. So, if I publish this app, everyone could create B-roll clips using my replicate account, which is obviously a huge issue. So when you see this warning, you should make sure to resolve all security issues before publishing your app. And obviously, it doesn't necessarily need to stop here. In between these two models, we could have added GPT5 to automatically enhance the prompts before feeding it into the replicate models. And we could have added an upscaling step at the end to get full 4K quality using a video upscaler model and just about a hundred other things. Replicate already has models for a ton of different things. But if you really want to go niche and it's not already on Replicate, you can go to hawking phase and find an additional 2 million super specialized AI models, fine-tune them, and upload them to your replicate account. Everything that can be solved with AI is available here. And as I've mentioned a few times now, in this video, I've shown the cut down happy path of building a tool like this. In the real world, it's unlikely to go this smooth in the first try. And typically you'll have to go back and forth with lovable for a bit. So don't get discouraged if it doesn't spin up a SAS for you exactly how you want it in the first try. And if you want to take a SAS like this to the next level, you should layer the approach we've discussed in this video with two additional layers of AI assisted coding which I cover in this video. So go watch this one next.

TITLE: This AI agent makes you a Top Voice on social media (AgentKit + FeedHive MCP)

================================================================================

You've seen these people who are always first on a big story, instantly owning the conversation, and you know that's how you build the authority that drives real business. But at this point, it's an exhausting race to keep up. So, what if you had an AI agent to scout the news for you and a second AI, your personal ghostriter, to instantly draft the post in your unique voice? You'd go from hunting for news to simply hitting publish. Your audience would quickly notice you being the first to the conversation every single time. This is the exact system we'll build in this video step by step turning you into a top voice in your industry. Let's dive in. If you're new to this channel, welcome here. I'm Simon Hardburg and I'm building Founder Stack, a collection of five SAS tools specifically built for bootstrap founders. I use social media to drive sales and I know better than most people how powerful a personal brand can be and how big a difference it can make when you build authority with your audience. So I want to have one AI agent that I can chat with and delegate this task to. It should have a chat GPT like interface and based on a quick description it should be able to delegate all other tasks to other AI agents and we should end up with a post that's fully done and ready to publish. So, the only times I'm needed is at the very beginning by describing the topic I want to post about and at the very end by clicking schedule or publish and the post will go out. Let's cook. Openai recently launched their agent builder and their agent kit. And this is exactly what we need. So, let's head over to platform.openai.com. Let's go to the dashboard and let's go to the new agent builder. here. We'll see a few templates we can use, but in this case, we want to create a new one. Now, in order for this to work well, we'll split up this workflow into multiple AI agents with each their own responsibility and access to only the tools they need to do that one job. So, let's set up our first agent. This one is going to be a new scout. Let's give it instructions. The job of this AI agent is to search for news related to whatever the user is asking for and present a list of headlines that we can pick between. There we go. And we also want to add web search as a tool here. Keep it broad and open and make sure the context size is set to medium. Perfect. So now we have one AI agent that will find a handful of news headlines related to whatever topic the user wants to post about. Now let's create another AI agent. We can do that by dragging in another AI agent node here. Let's make sure to connect them. This one will be our news reporter. Let's give it its instructions. Its job is to pick one well suited news headline and further research it and create one news report based on that headline. And we also wanted to find a good image we can use for the post. Perfect. Now let's add another message here. Here we can include the output from the new scout agent. And because we're putting that here, we can disable the include chat history option here. In this way, we'll keep the context nice and clean. And also here, we'll add the web search tool. We'll keep it wide open and have a medium search context size. And because this task requires a bit more thinking, let's set the reasoning effort to medium. There we go. Perfect. We now have two AI agents in place. And just to be safe, let's add a user approval step here. We could remove this later, but I think it's nice to have this step for a while until we battle test the solution. Awesome. Let's test it out. [Music] And we'll see the AI thinking searching for the news and there we go. It will write one wells suited news report, find an image we can use and ask if we want to continue. That's perfect. The first part of our Top Voice news agent is ready. We had the AI search through various topics and pick one news to move forward with. And it created a report and found an image. Now, we need to have another AI agent write a good post about this for social media. And this part is actually much trickier than you'd think. Please, please do not just dump this whole thing into ChatGpt and ask it to write a post for you. It will come out super sloppy. And at this point, the internet is so filled up with bad AI slop already. Trust me, people on the internet can smell AI riding a thousand km away by now. No one's going to read it, and it will make you look super silly and hurt your brand. That doesn't mean you can't have AI ride it, though. But you need to lay the groundwork. This next AI agent needs to learn about your brand, your specific writing style, your tone of voice, and your brand values. It needs to understand you and your brand well enough to write in a way that looks and feels exactly like you would write it if you had done it manually. And this is actually pretty complex. It involves fine-tuning an AI model, creating a comprehensive brand brief, and building a quality assessment loop into your system. If you want to learn how to do this, I have another video where I go through this whole thing step by step. And because this video got so much traction, we actually built this whole thing into one of the products we run called FeedHive. So we have made this whole thing incredibly streamlined by building the whole process into our tool. And we have built a custom MCP server that enables you to set this up with other tools like OpenAI's Agent Builder. I'll leave a link to the other video in the description below. But for now, we're going to continue doing this using FeedHive, and I'll show you just how easy this has become. Let's go to feedhive.com and sign up for an account. The first thing we want to do is add our social accounts. There we go. Now, let's go to the brand profile page. Here, we start by picking a writing style that most closely fits with how we normally write or how we'd like to write. I like this one that's already selected, the vertical writing style. I think this one fits best with LinkedIn. in these days. Then we're going to scroll down to the brand brief section and we'll have AI generate this whole thing for us. So, select your socials here. Feed will look through all of them to get a sense of what your brand is like. I'll also add my personal website here. Awesome. Let's generate it. This might take a few minutes, but we'll let it do its thing. Awesome. We can see now that our AI put together a very comprehensive and detailed and very accurate brand brief based on the information we gave it. Of course, you can edit this at any time you want if there's something missing or something you think the AI didn't exactly get right. I think this one is spot on though, so I'll take it as is. Now, let's quickly test this out. We can go to the compose page here and click this button to create a quick AI post. Awesome. Yeah, this definitely sounds like something I would write. And it used the vertical writing style very well here. Very cool. Now, let's go to the automation page. And let's create a new trigger. I'll call this AI news trigger. And I want to publish for LinkedIn and Twitter. Now, what happens when triggered? Well, we can choose to both create and immediately publish a post. Though again, for now, I just want to see the post myself before going out. So, I'll stick to create draft for now. And we'll write this post with AI. So, let's choose GPT5 from the list. That's it. Let's save and publish this trigger. And this is everything we need from FeedHive. It's now ready to take a request, including a prompt, and it will combine that with your brand brief, your writing style, everything FeedHive now knows about you, and it will turn the whole thing into a post ready post for social media. Now, let's go back to the agent builder. We want to add another node after the approve step, and it should be an agent node, too. Under tools, we're going to add an MCP server. Here we can add mcp.feedhive.com. Let's call this fhmcp server. Now for this part, we need an access token. If we go back to feed hive, we can go to the settings page. Then scroll all the way down until we see the API key section. Let's generate a new key and copy it from here. And if we paste it here, we should be able to connect. Awesome. And we can see our trigger appearing under tools. And if we click here, we can quickly see that it is indeed the AI news trigger we created just before. And because it's an MCP server, OpenAI's agents already know exactly what to do with this tool and how to use it to make a post appear in FeedHive. Now, because we added an approval node previously in the workflow, we don't have to ask for approval to also use this tool. Let's add it here. And that's it. Now, let's call this agent prompt agent. Let's give it a description here. Its job is to create a prompt for feedhive and pass that along with the news report and the image. And here we need to tell it to use the FHMCP server tool. And that's it. Your final workflow should now look something like this. All right, time to test it out. Let's go to the preview mode and give this a prompt. All right. And we can see the new scout is getting to work. Okay. Then the news reporter. All right. So, it's suggesting a news about something with OpenAI making a deal with AMD. Sure, let's take it. Nice. So, the prompt agent is now preparing a prompt. Awesome. and it did a breakdown here about what the prompt consists of. That's it. Now, let's check out the final result in FeedHive. Let's go to posts. Look under the draft section. There it is. Wow. I mean, this is a great news post. And we even have an image of Sam Alman here. Really cool. So, this is great. I'll just go ahead and schedule this for next week. I know a lot of you will probably ask why didn't I use NAD for this and I definitely could have. However, I think for a workflow that starts with a chat conversation like this, I really think this new agent builder from OpenAI is super promising. And if I were to build something more complex, I could have had agent builder delegate to NAD first and then have NAND delegate to feed high. So, it's not really a question of NADN versus agent builder. I actually think they play very well together for more complex workflows. Now, the easiest way to use this agent is to simply click preview like we just did, but personally, I'd like a nice standalone chat interface I can visit in a browser. So, let's just go ahead and publish this workflow. We can get the workflow ID here. Let's head over to Lovable and ask it to cook up an interface real fast. We'll use the OpenAI's chat kit. So, make sure to include the documentation for Lovable to look up. If you're not already familiar with Lovable, it's a tool that will build software using AI. And it's one of my absolute favorite tools. I use it to build internal tools all the time. Now, after a few minutes and maybe a little back and forth, you'll have a chat interface that looks like this. And now, it's available on a website that we can use more easily. There we go. Really a super cool experience working with agent builder, agent kit, and feed hive like this. And right now, you can get lifetime access to FeedHive as well as four other awesome AI tools through our Founders Stack offer. Go to foundersstack.pro and for a single onetime purchase, you can set up this entire system for yourself. With this deal, we'll give you 50,000 AI credits to spend every month, which is enough for hundreds of posts. And if this is not enough, you can always add your own OpenAI API key and remove this limit altogether. all included for a single one-time purchase. If you don't want to use Vehive for this, that's of course totally understandable. In that case, I recommend you watch this video next. Here, I'm breaking down the entire flow, including the things FeedHive does, so you can use this with any social tool you want.

TITLE: This AI Coding Stack Writes 90% of My Code
VIDEO ID: IQqNRmoEa0s
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQqNRmoEa0s
================================================================================

I found the perfect stack for AI product development. And AI now writes 90% of my code. This exact AI stack has enabled me and my team to push out features and improvements faster than we have ever done before. The technology is finally here. Yet you'll see people saying this third rate fake worst code rejecting all AI written code. &gt;&gt; Your customers want you. But I can assure you AI product development does work. And if you use it right, it can make you more productive than you've ever been before. It can even allow low tech and non- tech founders to build incredible SAS solutions all by themselves. So in this video, I will walk you through this AI stack and show you the exact AI product development workflow. It consists of three tools and three approaches you have to use if you want this to work. If you're new to this channel, welcome here. I'm Simon Horberg and I run a SAS portfolio of four tools to handle social media automation, link tracking, AI, customer support, and graphics design. We are a small team of just four people, myself included, and we're on track to do $2 million AR in 2025 using the exact AI development stack I'm about to show you. The first layer of our stack is vibe coding. This is typically going to be the starting point of a new SAS or new major feature. Not long ago, this starting point used to look completely different. Typically, we would spend a lot of time planning a new feature. We would draft the designs in Figma. We would then tweak and polish and turn it into a prototype. Then finally, we would hand it off to one of our three developers who would manually start implementing it. And if you think this was timeconuming, you're absolutely right. And we were everything considered a small team. Earlier when I was working as a freelance consultant at huge companies I saw how this step would take months sometimes up to a year to complete and it would literally just be the starting point of a new feature or product. With AI this whole thing has completely changed. We now do all of this using one single tool. That tool is called lovable. By simply using natural language and by describing the vibe we want, we're now planning, drafting, designing, and prototyping all using one single tool. Lovable is built to be non or low tech friendly. So on our team, our UIUX designer does this. She will use some UIUX and software terminology, but other than that, she lets Lovable go at it just from a vibe. And Lovable does an impressive job at putting together an amazing looking, clean, and well-designed front end. And if we take a look at the code it produces, we'll see that it also puts together a well ststructured project using the latest and most popular frameworks and UI libraries. So in just a few hours with Lovable, we have a design, a prototype, and a starter in real application code ready to go. We'll sync it directly with GitHub to access the project from other tools if we need it. The next layer of our AI stack is agentbased coding. Once we have a starter, we want AI agents to continue the work asynchronously in the background. This is the step where I personally have become the most productive. Having a team of AI agents with access to my entire code base, all my repositories who will start working on the task I give them, do it all in the background, and come back with a PR. This has been a total game changer. Here's how it works. GitHub is a platform where you can store code and a PR is basically code suggestions that haven't yet been merged into the official codebase that goes out in production and becomes available to your users. Now, you give an AI agent a task. The AI agent will download your codebase from GitHub and start working on the task in the cloud. Once it's finished, it will create a PR on GitHub where you can review, request changes, or approve. There are multiple tools that can do this already, but one that does this really well is GitHub Copilot, which is already fully integrated into GitHub itself. In your repository, you simply click issues, which is GitHub's words for task. [Music] Here, you describe the task you need done. You sign GitHub Copilot and a few moments later, depending on the complexity, you will see a new PR under the pull request tab. From here, you can review the solution and either approve or ask C-pilot to make a few more changes. If you're a developer, you can review the actual code it wrote here, which I definitely recommend. And if not, I suggest configuring your hosting service like Verscell or Amplify to create a preview link where you can see the changes in action. And the awesome part about this workflow is that the agents are working on your solution completely asynchronously. So you don't have to be in front of your screen or keep a code editor open while it's doing its thing. Instead, you can split your work up in three, five, 10 smaller tasks, fill them out on GitHub, and let your agents work on them all while you do other things. Now, it's worth pointing out that the quality of the results highly depends on the quality of the task description you give it. And if it doesn't get it right, it does take a bit of time for it to go back and work every time you ask it to do something new. If you can include some technical description and engineering terminology here when you write these task descriptions, it does help the AI tremendously in doing a proper job. If you're a non-tech or low tech, GitHub does have a basic chat interface too where you can include your codebase and talk to the AI about it. And it might make sense to spend a bit of time with the AI here agreeing on what the task is and then have GitHub Copilot write its own task description. As I mentioned before, there are other tools doing the same thing. One of them is claw code, but personally I really dislike using a terminal for this and it's not really friendly for low or non- tech users. Also, GitHub C-Pilot is really generous with their limits right now. I'm on a $39 a month plan and I haven't managed to max this one out yet. The final layer is AI assisted coding. With this approach, we're pair programming with AI, but we're actually participating in the process using a code editor with built-in AI capabilities. For this part, you need to have at least some basic understanding of programming fundamentals and know your way around a code base. I would say low tech people can work at this level, especially if you're patient and naturally interested in trying to learn to code. Though, you will get most out of this step if you are a more routine software engineer. The most powerful and most popular tool for this layer of the stack is cursor. However, there are native extensions you can install in VS Code such as Klein or again GitHub Copilot which are picking up and getting really good too. Personally, I bounce between cursor and GitHub copilot and VS Code. They're both really powerful and strong options when it comes to AI assisted coding. Although cursor is generally ahead when it comes to delivering a smooth developer experience, but honestly I haven't really spent a whole lot of time coding like this recently. Both I and my team are now spending most of our time in layer 1 and layer two of this stack. Just this last month, we've built and launched an end toend Vibe marketing experience for one of our products, FeedHive. We've updated and tested a bunch of new features and improvements, and we've finished a completely new SAS that I'll be launching soon. If you go to foundersstack.pro, you can see all the products we're building, and you can buy lifetime access to all of them for a single one-time purchase. 90% of our efforts were spent in layer 1 and layer 2 when building this stack. A lot of people say vibe coding produces extremely lowquality results. And as I see it, it all comes down to two reasons. Most often, it's simply a matter of half-assed, rushed, lowquality prompts and task descriptions. If you went to Upwork and hired a human developer and gave them this same description, I can guarantee you the results will be extremely low quality, too. Like, what did you expect? Secondly, there is a limitation if you know absolutely nothing about coding. So, if you're completely non- tech and want to build a SAS this way, I highly encourage you to become at least low tech or maybe even a lightweight software developer. You don't have to pass an exam. You don't have to pass a job interview or get to a level where anyone would formally hire you, but just spend a bit of time learning some basic fundamentals of software engineering. And I promise you, the final output of VIP coding will become exponentially better. So, now you know how to build, but maybe you still don't know what to build. I got you. Cuz there's a way you can access thousands of ideas that people need but haven't yet been turned into a SAS. And in this video, I'll show you how. So, jump over here and I will see you there.

TITLE: 5 Tempting AI SaaS Ideas I’d NEVER Build (here’s why)
VIDEO ID: 0Axx_BWuxsU
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Axx_BWuxsU
================================================================================

Some AI SAS ideas seem so cool and so obvious and easy to build that it almost feels seductive. When you were playing around with the latest releases of the most powerful AI models or you tried creating your first AI automation workflow, your mind was blown. You got the perfect idea for an AI SAS you could build. And maybe it felt crystal clear to you how you would build it and how you would take it to market. But be careful. Some of these ideas seem deceptively obvious, but in reality, they are ideas that with overwhelming certainty will set you up for a massive failure. I get DMs from people pitching me their SAS ideas all the time. And there are five AI SAS ideas I see over and over. They are ideas that I would avoid at all costs. And in this video, we'll break it down. If you're new to this channel, welcome here. I'm Simon Horberg and I run a portfolio of AI SAS products to handle social media, link tracking, customer support, and graphics design. My team and I brainstorm, prototype, and test various new SAS ideas every year. And whenever we see a new idea falling into a category that comes too close to these five AI SAS we're about to discuss, we reject them immediately. And I believe you should do the same. The first AI SAS I would stay far away from is AI copywriters and the reason is simple. The market is flooded with them already. Since GPG3 launched back in 2022, we are now seeing the low barrier to entry really play out here. Some of the first movers like Copy AI and pepper type really made it big here. But at this point, the market is super saturated. It's very easy to spin up a new AI copywriter, and if all you do is wrap OpenAI's API, your tool will do basically the same as all others. It might look like a low-hanging fruit, and it certainly takes very little effort to get up and running, but in my opinion, it will be incredibly hard to stand out if you go down this path. The result is a race to the bottom on pricing, and it's probably one of the markets with the highest turn rates out there. Also, I've noticed this thing. I've seen several big influencers, especially on LinkedIn, who now all ship the same AI copywriters, and frankly, I think it's starting to look a little bit silly. It seems to be a bit of a playbook these guys are all doing now, and it just smells a little bit like a cash grab. Of course, I'm not the one to judge, and maybe I just don't see what's going on behind the scenes, but I fail to see how these copywriters provide something that any standard LLM like Chat GBT or Gemini don't already provide. I think an AI copywriter is a great feature in a bigger product. Like, we have an excellent AI copywriter in FeedHive, which is a social media management tool my team and I run. But it is just one out of many features that make up an AI powered marketing tool. As a standalone product, I'd stay far away. Next one on the list is AI coding tools. You know, tools similar to cursor and wind surf. I would stay far away from this market as a bootstrap founder. And now you're probably thinking, wait a minute, those tools are AI powered and they have product market fit and they're very successful. Yes, you're right. But there's one very important thing we need to consider about these tools. A huge part of what makes cursor so attractive isn't necessarily how it codes, but how much it offers at a rather cheap price. If you take a look at a tool like client, which is an open-source VS Code extension where you bring your own API key, and compare what you get for your money on cursor, you will quickly realize that the average cursor user is very likely losing money for cursor. One of the most significant challenges in building anything with AI is the way LLM API providers structure their pricing. The cost is directly proportional to the consumption of the tool. Meaning the more users interact with your app, the higher your expenses climb. So a successful active user base, which normally should be a cause of celebration for a bootstrap company, suddenly becomes a pretty hectic financial liability. And if your product is aggressively consuming AI, you will have a business model that bleeds cash as the business grows. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, but we just have to remember that tools like Cursor is heavily backed by top tier investment funds. They have substantial financial backing, allowing them to absorb these extreme operational losses as a trade-off to get to market dominance. That's their game. It's a classical VC hyperrowth startup. And as a bootstrap founder, that's who you're competing with. It's not really about building the best product. It's about who can afford bleeding the most cash. And I would stay far away. All right. Third AI SAS I wouldn't touch is AI therapists. So at first glance, the idea of having an AI based therapist might sound like a cool idea. Like having a portable ondemand therapist right in your pocket. The value prop is pretty obvious. And there's actually a lot of data showing that many people now use chat GBT as a therapistlike chatbot to give insights and offer emotional support. But in reality, this idea is a complete ethical shitow. There are countless ways this could go horribly wrong, and I'd like to highlight just a few. Back in March 2023, a man from Belgium ended his life. In the weeks leading up to his death, he'd been talking to this highly advanced AI chatbot called Eliza on the Chai app. And according to the man's wife, the chatbot encouraged the man to end himself by convincing him that he could save the planet by sacrificing himself. Another recent example is from the National Eating Disorders Association in the US. In 2023, they had to take down their AI chatbot, Tessa, which was giving users with eating disorders harmful suggestions such as restricting calories and losing weight. Literally, the whole purpose of the chatbot was to do the exact opposite of that. And of course, I don't think that we can necessarily say that these chat bots are the cause of these bad things happening. These people may have suffered from trauma, depression, or psychosis before entering the chat. And by the end of the day, it's the person's choice to act on the advice they're given. However, if your AI therapist somehow got into the middle of a case like this, it's just way, way too much to handle if you're a small bootstrap founder or an indie hacker. I remember Peter Levelvels, who is one of the most well-known and wellrespected indie hackers, started working on an AI therapist too, but quickly wrapped up the project due to push back from his audience, which I absolutely believe was the right choice. Stick to products that are much more non-critical by nature. Anything that has to do with people's health, both physically and mentally, I would stay far away from. The next one on the list is AI detectors. The sales pitch is pretty simple. before you publish a piece of content that was written by AI, you should run it through a detector so it can detect the parts that look like AI. And then you can tweak that manually and Google won't know that you used AI. Or even better, some of the more advanced tools actually do this rewriting for you. So you can kind of cloak your content a little so it doesn't look like it was written by AI. I think tools like these have at least three major flaws. First of all, a tool like this isn't offering a solution to the right problem. Google is very clear about this. The problem is not using AI to write the content. The problem is lowquality, spammy content clearly made to manipulate search rankings. Even if one of these detectors concludes that your content is not written by AI, it might still get deranked because the quality simply isn't high enough. Secondly, AI detector tools like this are basically boiling the cat and mouse game down to a third-party SAS tool. You don't have access to Google's algorithms, and you probably shouldn't build your business by attempting to play a game of cat-and- mouse with Google, where you have to constantly guess how their internal systems work. And finally, tools like these are probably going to make your content much worse. Trying to patch up a piece of content that is already written is a terrible idea. If anything, you should build a tool or a service that aims to write great, highquality content with AI to begin with. Again, Google doesn't mind if AI was used as long as it's good and helpful content. There are a few tools out there doing exactly this already, and I actually have a video where I show you how to build a custom workflow for this in NAN. I'll leave a link in the description below. So, an AI detector tool especially used for SEO is something I would stay away from. The final AI SAS I would avoid is AI summarizers. The thought of having an AI that can read through, digest, and summarize hours of meetings or endless email threads in your inbox does seem like a really useful problem to solve. And the truth is it has been solved many times already. This one kind of goes down the same bucket as AI copywriters, but in a sense, I think this one is even worse. An AI summarizer is no longer a product. It's become a feature. And not just any feature, but an aggressively integrated and completely free feature that now sits natively in all major productivity and platform ecosystems. Anyone using Google Workspaces are getting their emails summarized, covered in one click, natively, and for free. Meetings are automatically summarized, and every Google Meet call generates a meeting recap with key action items. Also, you'd have to overcome an enormous trust barrier in order to get adoption to gain access to every email in the customer's inbox, including sensitive and private emails and every meeting and every employees calendar, including private or internal conversation. It's not just something companies hand over to any small bootstrap company. And I know there's a whole debate around this, but generally speaking, users do trust Google or Microsoft with this data already. Personally, I wouldn't want to compete here. So, these are five AI SAS ideas I would stay far away from. On the other hand, there is this super simple approach to unlocking thousands of potential micros ideas that are worth building. And I don't often hear people talk about this. If you're curious about this approach, go watch this video next. I will see you over there.

================================================================================

Someone is going to get really rich doing this. You might have noticed how social media got filled with these cool Nad workflows that use AI to solve all kinds of things. I've been sharing my workflows, too, both on LinkedIn and here on YouTube. NAN is an incredible tool and these workflows are truly really helpful. But a lot of people, especially people who don't have technical skills, find these very difficult and complex to use. And I guess the UI of Naden can be a bit intimidating. A lot of people want something more simple, a simple form, click a button, and then you get the results. And this is a massive opportunity cuz YouTube is filled with powerful N workflows that solve real problems for real users, often free to download, free of charge. And if you can slide in between the workflow and the average user and offer access in a more userfriendly way, you'll be in business. And in this video, I'm going to show you three different ways this could be achieved. Ranging from that simple to more challenging, but with bigger potential. Let's go. If you're new to this channel, welcome here. I'm Simon Hornberg and I run a SAS portfolio of AI tools to help you grow your personal brand, handle incoming emails, and support, track link engagement, and much more. We are a fully bootstrapped small team of just four people, myself included. And the reason we can stay this lean is because we know how to use AI and automation to handle most of our operations. If you're not familiar with NADN, it's a popular AI and automation tool similar to Sapier and Make, but much more powerful. And I use this tool heavily to run my startup. The first and easiest approach is to build a super simple and streamlined UI on top of a really good but complex NAN workflow. Here's how it works. Scroll YouTube for NAN workflows. Try to find one that looks really valuable, but also one that looks a bit complex and where you notice many people in the comments struggle to make it work. Then simply download the workflow and get it running on your own NAND account. The best and most scalable option here is if you have it self-hosted, so you can have unlimited workflow runs. Now, NAND allows you to start any workflow using an incoming web hook, which essentially is just an API endpoint. So, you now go and build a simple UI on top of this where users can input only the most crucial things the workflow needs to get started. Some workflows may need a user to log in with Google. Some may need that they upload certain files. But that's it. You stripped away all the complexity and now offer a very simple but very powerful little tool for one specific job. And here's how you could monetize this. If your NAN workflow uses something like Open AI, then you obviously need to pay for the tokens through your own account. Asking users to bring their own API key is again complex for some users, but it also gives you the opportunity to charge users for the AI credits that's being used and of course add a small margin on top. Of course, you could also offer monthly plans to accommodate a certain number of workflow runs per month. Once you find a good workflow, understand it and make it work for yourself. You can use tool like Lovable to describe the use case and quickly create the perfect user-friendly UI to put on top. Now, the second approach is a bit more ambitious, but here we start thinking bigger. Instead of a single use case, you create a collection, go on a spree, and collect super valuable innate workflows while creating really simple user-friendly UIs on top of them. You can start with two or three, but keep iterating. Use YouTube as your source of inspiration and keep adding new workflows to your collection. Call it easyN or something like that. And then ensure that users need to create just a single account to use any app in your collection. And now you can sell subscription plans that covers all apps under your ECN umbrella. And just like before, you could also here offer AI credits and add a margin to make a profit. There's a tool called Run Comfy, and they're doing something very similar. They took an existing open-source tool, Comfy UI, and now they're collecting workflows and provide one-click run in the cloud with a super simple UI on top. These complex comfy UI workflows still run in the background, but the user will see a simplified interface to do a single specific job. I think this is super clever. You could build a small library of reusable UI components for all your workflow forms. Give Lovable access to your repository and simply use Lovable to repeat the process of creating simple userfriendly UIs on top of your workflows. Finally, the last approach is the hardest, but also the one with the biggest potential. With this approach, you zoom out a bit and ask yourself, what exactly is the problem this workflow is solving? What does users achieve by using it? How is their businesses or lives better by using this exact workflow? Find a popular, super comprehensive, and complex workflow and turn the core of that problem into a fullyfledged SAS. Now the scope of this SAS might span much more than what the workflow is offering and you might keep growing the product in the direction of your users's feedback but using the idea behind that one NN workflow as a starting point. You could still use lovable to create a SAS starter but for a tool like this I would move more into custom code maybe assisted by tools like cursor or client and a custom backend and infrastructure on AWS. Use the workflow only as an entry point to kick things off, but replace the steps in the workflow with custom API endpoints you control yourself. Now you have the UI on top. You replaced Naden with your own backend and now you have a fullyfledged SAS product ready to serve. If you follow any of these three steps, you will have a SAS by the end of the year, at least in some form. And who knows, by building one SAS this way, you'll quickly get a better understanding of how to build and run a SAS in general, and it might spark some serious inspiration to do more. I think NAN workflows are a great source of inspiration. They are easy to access, mostly free, and fundamentally they solve a problem. Now, if you want more inspiration like this, take a look at these five real AI agent business ideas you can build in 2025. I will see you over there.

TITLE: How To Build a Content Team of SEO AI Agents (n8n, OpenAI, Aidbase)
VIDEO ID: Bmlkdvg8QgI

================================================================================

I let these AI agents take full control over my blogs. They are now doing research, writing the posts, creating the thumbnails, and publishing daily blogs for my products, Feed Hive, Link Drip, and Abbase. And the results are surprisingly [Music] good, at least for now. Cuz who's going to read all this content? What happens if Google detects that this is AI? Is it worth the risk of deranking your websites forever? I can't tell you if it's worth the risk, but I'll try to inform you to make a rational decision for yourself, and I'll show you how to set up this workflow for yourself in NAN step by step. For a long time, I was living in fear. They're not going to get away with it. In fact, Google has already made it very clear they will fight AI generated content with all they got. Instead, I would focus on a to cuz I heard people say again and again that you should never use AI to generate SEO content. But at the same time, my blogs were dead and I simply didn't have the time to sit and manually write content often enough. I did some research, but Google's policies aren't exactly clear about this. They say they don't penalize content just because it's written by AI, but they do penalize lowquality, unhelpful content created primarily to manipulate search rankings. So, mass-produced, low value AI content clearly fits this description and would be treated as spam. But it also meant that if I could create helpful, highquality, relevant content using AI, I'd be home safe. If I was going to do this, I was going to do it right. I would need careful research, quoting other sources from the internet. I would need unique internal knowledge that couldn't be copied from other places, and I would need custom onbrand thumbnails that would fit with the overall design of my website. After carefully considering the consequences and the pros and cons, I decided to go for it. Let's break it down. Every blog post starts with a topic and a plan for which keywords it should appear under. Having an AI do proper keyword research, find content gaps, and generate real content ideas is challenging, but we do have a few options available. First, we have SER API. This is simply the API version of Google. You'll give it a search term and what you get back is basically page one on Google but in JSON format. This is very useful since you can have an AI agent do a Google search through NAN to see what already shows up under a given keyword. Secondly, we have Perplexity's sonar model. This is an AI search model that will search, retrieve, and synthesize information from the internet. This is super useful to search for real information and facts without having to manually read through a bunch of websites to find what you're looking for. Finally, we have OpenAI's new search model. It's similar to Perplexity Sonar models, but it's currently in preview. Now, I tried a bunch of different approaches to make this work. And what I found is that there are two ways you can start this workflow. You can do all the keyword research manually and give the AI clear and precise instructions on what to write about. If you are an expert SEO and keyword researcher, you probably want to do it like this and accept that the workflow isn't going to be fully autonomous. Or you can do it the way I ended up doing it, and that is by using OpenAI's search model to find content ideas for you based on an overall description of your product and brand. This will give you much less control and most likely a smaller overall chance of ranking well for each post, but at least it will post entirely on its own. Let's set this up. If you don't have an account on NAN already, now is the time to create one. You also need to add your OpenAI credentials here so NAN can connect with your OpenAI account. It's super easy. Simply follow the instructions here. Now create a new workflow and add a schedule trigger. Configure this according to how often you want to publish a new post. Now let's add an AI note. Pick open AAI and pick message a model and let's call it search topic ideas. Let's pick GBT40 search preview from the list of models. The first prompt should be a system prompt and we will give it a basic set of instructions like this. This agent will be writing content for Feed Hive, one of my products. So, make sure to change this description to something that fits your brand. All right, let's test it out. Are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. Awesome. GBT40 search did a great job here. I tried to have an AI agent do actual longtail keyword research from Nadn using various different approaches I found on other YouTube videos, but honestly, it just doesn't really work that well. So, you can either do manual keyword research or you can let GBT40 search go off totally on its own and come up with things. So far, I've had surprisingly good results with doing it this way. Now, let's bring in another AI note again. Message a model. Let's call this one prepare topic. For this one, we can pick GBT40. And also here we want to have a system prompt. This is our content architect. It needs somewhat specific instructions. We also want to describe the exact JSON format it needs to output. This part is very important. And here we want to turn on output content as JSON. Now let's add another prompt which should be a user prompt. Here we want to add the ideas the research AI came up with. and test it. Nice. These agents have now done their job. Let's wrap them in a sticky note to organize them nicely. This first part of the final workflow is almost finished. Now, how do we make sure that these two AI agents will come up with new ideas and not just repeat themselves every day? After all, we don't want to end up cannibalizing on ourselves on the same exact keywords and topics. Also here I tried a few different methods including storing all blog post as vectors in a vector database so the sentiment of new ideas could be compared to previous posts but again sounds fancy but it just doesn't practically work that well. So I ended up simply giving the AI agents access to a simple list of summaries of previous posts. This part highly depends on which system you're using to publish your blog posts. You can use a headless CMS like strappy or prismic. You can use a no code tool like web flow framer or you can commit these directly to a GitHub repository as markdown files if you're hardcore like that. I use strappy. So in my case I will make an API call to strappy using the HTTP request node. This is how you filter blog post entries in strappy but obviously this will be different depending on your setup. There we go. Now let's add this node here before we start researching. And let's just add a few extra instructions to the research agent. Good. And add a user message. We'll just drop all the data from our blog archive like that. And turn it into a JSON string so the chat model can absorb it all. Perfect. This does the job. So far, I haven't caught my two agents producing duplicates. So now we have a description of the topic, a title, a description of an image we want for the thumbnail, and an outline as a list of chapter headlines. We now have everything we need to have AI write the blog post. Or at least that's what I thought. But no matter how many times I tried, these blog posts would come out generic, shallow, boring, and empty. They just wouldn't be worth reading. And most likely these blog posts would be exactly what Google would classify as spam. But then I realized what was missing. There are certain elements that all good blog posts tend to have. Statistics, facts, references. Good blog posts reference other articles and sources on the internet and incorporate them into their post to underline the point they're trying to make. And the best blog post will also have unique insights. They're not just reiterating what other people have already said a thousand times. They bring something new to the table. Insights from their business. There is no way around it. Before moving on to writing the blog post, I needed a special step. This part is critical to make the system work. We need two other AI agents to do additional research before writing the actual post. But instead of researching topic ideas, this agent digs deeper into one specific topic to find interesting facts, statistics, and discoveries that we can use as supporting knowledge and references for a blog post. The other one is an AI with secret access to an internal knowledge base. This is a data archive with private data which might be interesting to include in a relevant blog post. It is data that we are sure no other blogs have access to. This will help keep our blogs unique. So, first we need an AI that can do research. You can use OpenAI's GBT4 search or you can use Perplexity's sonar models. Perplexity now has a sonar deep research model. You can use this if you really need exhaustive research to include in your articles, though it's much more expensive. And for my use case at least, the regular sonar models or GPT4 search will do just fine. To keep this workflow simple, we'll use GPT4 search like we did in the previous step. Let's set this up. So, we'll add another node and again pick OpenAI's messenger model and again find the search preview model. Let's change the first prompt to system and give it a prompt. This part highly depends on your specific needs. Generally, I recommend starting out with something like this and then specify further if needed. Great. Let's also add a user prompt. And here we want to add the title and the description from the previous step. Let's test it. We got the content and all the citations. Now, the next part is where it gets really exciting. We need to prepare our internal knowledge base. We're going to do this with a system called Rag. This allows us to let an AI agent search and retrieve relevant knowledge from our private knowledge base. Nadn supports vector databases such as pine cone, but if you're non techch, it's pretty complex and not very userfriendly. So instead, we're going to use a base and I'll show you just how easy it is to set up a rag. Go to 8base.ai and sign up for a free trial. You want to pick the pro plan since we need API access. If you think $99 per month sounds expensive, don't worry. I'll show you how to get around this in a moment. Now that we have the account ready, go to sources. Here we can add our knowledge sources. We can add our website. Since my blog is for my product FeedHive, I'll add FeedHive's main website and FeedHive's help desk website here. If there are pages on your website you don't want to include, you can go here and exclude them. We also have a bunch of these university videos on our YouTube channel. So, I'll add those two. There we go. Now, I'll select them all and click train AI models. This is going to take a few minutes. Now let's go to the FAQs page and create a new FAQ. This is really really cool cuz it allows me to manage knowledge directly in a base. So here I can start adding questions like this. And you can expand this with all interesting internal facts you have about your business which might be interesting to include in a blog post. And if we go back to the FAQs, then we can train this entire FAQ Awesome. Now we have AI models with direct knowledge from our knowledge base. Let's create a new chatbot with Abbase. A chatbot comes with a chatbot UI. You can use this to embed the chatbot directly on a website. However, in our case, we can ignore all of this since we will use a base API to talk to this chatbot directly. So all we have to do is go to knowledge and add the knowledge we just trained. So this specific chatbot can use it. Now if we go to settings, we see the chatbot ID here. Note this down cuz we'll be using this in a moment. Let's go to settings, click API keys, and create a new API key. Let's grab this API key and head back over to NAD. From the dashboard, click create credentials. Choose header off and in name write authorization and in value enter bearer space and then paste the API key. Now, back in the workflow, let's add an AI agent node. Let's add a chat model. This can be simple, so let's just use GPT40 mini. Now, I add simple memory and give this a fixed key. For the tool, let's add an HTTP request node. We want this to be a post method. And for the URL, we'll add this API.ai V1 chatbot ID reply. And instead of ID, we'll use the chatbot ID we noted down from when we created the chatbot in a base before. There we go. Under authentication, choose generic credential type header off and pick a base from the list. Perfect. We also need to include a body. Put the name message here and let the model decide the value. We also want to add a session ID and again let the model decide this value too. Let's scroll back up and give this tool a description. Now let's rename this get internal knowledge. Perfect. Now, let's go back to the AI agent and give it some instructions. There we go. Let's test it out. Awesome. It works perfectly. So now we have both knowledge from the open internet and internal knowledge we can use for our blog post. And as always, full transparency, 8base is one of the SAS products my team and I run. And if you don't want to pay the $99 per month for the pro plan, we actually offer access to 8base as a lifetime deal too. If you go to founderstack.pro, you will get a bundle containing not just a base, but also feed hive, link drip, and tiny kiwi. Basically, my entire SAS portfolio for a single one-time purchase. And with this deal, you get access to the equivalent of the pro plan with 8base. So you can fully leverage the API and all its cool automation capabilities. Okay. Finally, let's tidy this up. This is now a part of the working workflow, too. Now, we can finally move on to writing the actual blog post. And because we've prepared, planned, and researched our post already, we just need one AI to handle the actual writing. If you prefer, you can fine-tune a model for this if you want a specific tone of voice. Or you can use a base model of choice. Claude, Deepseek, Gemini, Open AI, they all have very capable base models for basic content writing, which means that this part is going to be pretty easy to set up. My go-to here is going to be 03 Mini from OpenAI, which is a chain of thought model. I think it does very well for this type of task. As always, let's give it a system prompt. We'll give it a description of its task. And we'll add a user message, too. And we'll provide it with all the things it needs to write the post. Let's test it out. And look at that. A fulllength, well-ritten, wellressearched blog post with unique knowledge and sources from the internet. I mean, this is valuable. I would now read this and find it interesting and valuable even if AI put it all together. And this is exactly what we want. At this point, the system was working. But there was one thing still missing. This was optional, but I personally think a blog post should have a nicel looking thumbnail. And not just that, I wanted a thumbnail that was consistent on the brand and fit in with the website design and the overall blog page. And this part was tricky. My first approach was simply to use Flux to generate the thumbnails based on the image description created by one of the agents and then have another agent put some text on top. I just don't think they fit. Well, I personally really like them. Me, too. I think they're the best thumbnails I've ever seen. Could you guys just be honest for once? Yeah, they suck. Absolutely awful. Listen, Simon, if you want this part without coding, this is the best you will get. Hey, why don't we just vibe code it? Vibe code it? Ah, yes. You tell us how you'd like it and we'll code a program that generates the perfect thumbnails. You know how to do that, Simon? Please. I'm not going to go too deep into details about this part. What I can say is I used cursor to vi code a solution using NodeJS and a library called canvas. And after a few hours I had a perfect solution running on a custom API. This API would take an image, a text, a color theme, and a list of highlighted words and then put a thumbnail together on this specific theme. And it works perfectly. The easiest way to generate images from AI is using Flux on Replicate. Go to replicate.com and create an account. Go to AI tokens and create a new token. And just like we did with Abase, create a new credential from the NAN dashboard. Add authorization in the name and type bearer space. Then paste the API key from replicate. Now we can add an HTTP request node. Let's change this to post. Use the URL API replicate v1 models black forest labs flux predictions. In authentication, use generate credential type header off and pick the replicate credentials from the list and as a body let's add these fields using JSON. For the prompt, let's finally use the image description from the very first step. And to make our lives a little easier, let's add this header with the name prefer and the value wait. This will make the request wait for the actual image to be generated before it returns a response. Let's see. Awesome. Now, you can use this image as is. You can also change the proportions to 69 if this fits better. And in my case, I'll quickly add another AI here which is responsible for generating the parameters for my custom thumbnail API. Let's add an HTTP node for the thumbnail API here. And when we put it all together, boom, there we go. If you're up for the challenge, try opening cursor and vibe code your own API like this. If you're not a programmer, I wouldn't do this for commercial productionready software, but for a small extension like this, I think it is perfectly good and fun to use AI to vibe code a solution, even if you're not a professional software engineer. From here, the only thing left is to publish the actual blog post. For me, this publishing step includes pushing the title, description, content of the blog post, and the thumbnail to Strappy, where I keep all my blog content. I also have a step that uses a trigger in feed hive. So the blog post gets published on social media too. For you this publishing step might look different. Nadn has firstparty integrations with strappy WordPress web flow and a lot of other tools. So this part is up to you to set up according to your needs. But as you can see this now works fully autonomously. It requires no human intermediate steps. After setting up this workflow, simply lean back and watch blog post coming out every day or every other day or once a week, however often you want to post. This has been a total game changer for our blogs and we're seeing really good results with literally no effort, zero. It's fully automated. And while that being said, I still need to make an important point here. This is extremely experimental and potentially really risky. So if SEO is your best performing channel, if it is the top channel for your business where mostly all your users come from, if you have spent years perfecting your writing skills and your blog really means a lot to you, then probably you don't want to do this. You've probably noticed that I put a whole lot of effort into making these YouTube videos and that's because this is my highest performing channel and I would never try to fully automate this with AI. I care way too much about it to go down that road. But for me in my business, my blogs are way down the list. They were really never performing that well and they were more or less dead for a good while. So for me, this was totally worth the gamble and so far it's working out really well. But before you consider replicating this setup, just keep in mind where you see your blog post fit into your business. If it's higher on the list or you're planning for it to be higher on the list, you probably want to reconsider using this exact approach. By all means, though, set it up, play around with it, and see if it's useful for your business, too. You can get access to both Abbase and Feed Hive, as well as two other tools for a single lifetime purchase on Foundersstack.pro. And as a Founder Stack member, you can also download this entire workflow and import it into your own NN account to save some extra time. I have put links in the description for all of this. Now, excuse me. I need to get back to work, or rather my agents will. But if you want to see how to set up a similar workflow, but for content on social media, check out this video next. I will see you over there.

TITLE: 5 (Real) AI Agent Business Ideas For 2025
VIDEO ID: 2P9gPux6UfI
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P9gPux6UfI
================================================================================

it has now been more than 3 years and new AI Technologies still keep popping up but honestly it's only very recently that AI went from hype to actually becoming really useful you can now build complex AI agent workflows to handle work previously required human labor you can train and fine-tune your own custom AI models to carry out very specialized tasks you can even prototyp code and do the work of a small development team all by yourself there's a lot of opportunity here but we also need to be realistic all of this is still very early stage and while the interest in replacing human work with AI is Skyhigh there's still quite a barrier to entry but the good part about that is that it's creating business opportunities for you who know how to handle AI in this video I will give you five realistic ideas on how to monetize your AI agents tools and expertise in 2025 no real ideas with real potential and break Downs of how to carry them out let's go it's pretty clear that we're entering a phase where AI agents will start taking over a lot of the manual work people used to do using traditional SAS software early adopters are already jumping onto this as we speak and it opens the doors for a lot of business to be made so here's the first idea selling AI agent workflows the most sophisticated tool to build AI agents right now is NN nadn is an automation to tool kind of like sapure and make you can build complex workflows and Integrations with any tool that has an API and the best part is nadn has one of the best if not the best AI agent implementation on the market right now which means that you can build real sophisticated agenic workflow using models from open AI clot deep seek and many others and here's where the business opportunity comes in these workflows often get very complex and they're pretty timec consuming to put together there are a ton of great tutorials on YouTube on how to do this but I know for a fact that many businesses especially small businesses would be happy to pay for a complex workflow that has been already crafted and that they can incorporate into their own workflows directly and there are two ways you can do this the first one is by selling workflow templates let's say you have spent hours creating a really useful and valuable workflow in nadn you want to offer this to your users the most straight forward way to monetize this is to export the finished workflow file directly from nadn and then let people buy access to this file for a one-time payment you can put up a simple website and using a payment system like stripe and then send the user the workflow file in an email after they purchase people have been doing this with notion templates figma templates webflow templates and so on it's pretty much the same principle the other one is by selling access to workflow runs in n you can expose your workflow through a web hook so your workflow can be triggered by another nadn workflow or another system entirely for that matter in this way people can call your workflow through nad's API and get the final result or output but they don't have to worry about the details of the workflow itself so after the user purchases access you simply send them this URL now they can add your workflow as a tool for their own AI agents to use they can simply call this as they would with any other API and if you want to protect it to make sure only paying users have access nadn got you covered you can add authentication directly to the web hook node that triggers the workflow now with this method the workflow is running on your nadn account and if it's using AI it's consuming tokens from your accounts so since this is consuming resources on your end it might make sense selling access to this workflow as a subscription or a per call basis rather than a one-time purchase both of these are great ways to monetize your nadn work now selling AI agents is a brand new opportunity since they haven't been around for very long but there's another opportunity that has been around almost forever and that's selling knowledge you can sell info products paid courses coaching master classes and so on the idea of selling knowledge isn't new at all but AI is giving you a very new format and a new medium to do it specifically I'm talking about knowledge-based AI chatbots consider this example you want to learn how to run paid ads on Facebook you now have a few options you can learn it by yourself or you can lean on the knowledge of someone who has the right credentials or expertise you might join the master classes offered by Ben Heath Media or you might buy the maker ads guide which is a paid course both are great but imagine this instead of buying access to a course you get access to a chatbot similar to chat DT that was trained specifically on the knowledge from and by your favorite author on a specific topic you can now ask this chatbot specific questions and it will use its knowledge to help and guide you in the process using expert knowledge but with the context of your specific case this could be offered as an addition to a paid course or as a standalone product now let's flip it around if you're that expert or you have access to expert knowledge then you can offer this specialized AI chatbot to your audience here's exactly how I would set this up I would use a tool called eight base to create the chatbot and manage all the knowledge with eight base you can create and manage a knowledge Base by using public knowledge like websites or YouTube videos but you can also upload documents like PDF files or manage your knowledge base directly an eight basis Rich FAQ editor this makes it easy to create create manage and update a large knowledge base for your AI chatbot now you can train on this data give the AI chatbot access to the knowledge and put this chatbot on your website behind a pay wall for paying users what you should never do is giving your knowledge base to a custom GPT in a system prompt it is super easy to trick the AI into spitting out the entire system prompt which you definitely want to avoid large language models also tend to perform pretty bad on large contexts eight base doesn't have any system prompt instead it is actively querying the specific data it needs for each chat message based on what is being asked using a technology called rag with eight base you can even inspect each conversation see which knowledge it retrieves and correct it on the Fly for a more accurate reply in future conversations it's a really solid approach and full disclosure eight bases one of the SAS products my team and I run so I am a little biased here but personally I have not seen any other tool handle a knowledge base and a UI based rack system as well as 8B does and let me just blow your mind for a second right now you can buy lifetime access to eight Bas for a single onetime purchase that means that you can invest in eight Bas once and use it to sell your knowledge-based AI chatbots recurringly to your clients now there are some limits to how many monthly messages the chatbot can handle with this deal but if you can stay within those limits there is potential for a massive Roi if you use eight base for your business oh and by the way in this lifetime deal you also get access to three other tools all included go to found stack. proo and check it out I'll leave a link in the description all right so far we've considered offering AI built around existing tools but what if you could train or fine-tune your very own AI model and offer access to it directly your using an API let's talk about selling access to a custom AI model you probably already know that you can download and use open source models like flux stable diffusion deep seek and many others they're available to download on huging face you can now specialize these models by using a technique called fine-tuning perhaps you want flux which is an image generation model to Output images of a very specific kind for instance you can find you a flux model to create h eyes for a 3D software like blender or you can find un to create Vivid high contrast YouTube thumbnails that will get more clicks or you can fine-tune deep seek to reply in a specific way or in a specific format this kind of fine-tuned version of an open source based model is called a Laura model and getting a Laura model really good might take a lot of tries a lot of experimenting tweaking tuning and depending on what you're fine- tuning for might require specific expert expse and knowledge so again if you have that knowledge and you have managed to train a really good Laura model you can absolutely charge people to use this model the best way to do this is to use a platform called replicate with replicate you can deploy fine-tune and run AI models at scale you can do the fine-tuning jobs directly on replicate itself or you can upload your Laura models to replicate and expose it through replicates API and similar to the first example with NAD also here you can charge users to use this API you can either provide an API key to replicates API directly or you can develop your own proxy API that you can put in front of replicate both ways would enable users to run your Laura model without neither you or the users having to deal with complex infrastructure and GPU Hardware scaling and so on and so on I think this is an excellent opportunity to monetize AI now let's talk about a way you can use a ey indirectly to get better results with your products services or to help monetize something that would otherwise be considered just a fun hobby project if you've been active on Twitter in the past few weeks you might have stumbled on this expression called Vibe coding which basically means using cursor or wind Ser to do all the coding for you based on a Vibe this resulted in some really interesting project mostly small Indie Games created with 3js and cursor Peter levels was one of the first to create a small game and within just a few days he was already making tens of thousands of dollars in ads but a bunch of other people followed up this guy Nicola created a small sailing game called Vibe sale and also here advertisers jumped on board and generated a fair amount of revenue for this guy in fact I bought a Founder stack Banner myself for this game and it's actually producing clicks not long after people introduced the notion of Vibe marketing and Vibe designing and Vibe entrepreneuring and people started having all kinds of different takes on this and a bunch of people praised this new approach about vibing everything and I just want to make it clear I don't think that's a good idea at all I know some people give the impression that that's all they're doing and that it's all fun and play but I firmly believe that being structured organized and very intentional with what you're doing will by the end of the day create the best outcome however I still think we can use the concept of vibing to put new ideas to the test I think it's an excellent approach for prototyping and testing the waters I can totally see myself Vibe coding a simple new product then Vibe designing some quick ads and see if I can get some interest and if something catches on you can then switch vibing to a more intentional approach finally let's talk about the last and most obvious way to monetize your AI Solutions some businesses don't don't want to buy your workflow files they don't want to access your knowledge so they can learn they don't even want to buy access to an API endpoint so they can consume your AI directly they literally want you to come and set everything up for them without having to do or learn anything there are a lot of businesses right now who totally get the point they know that getting into Ai and automation is the way to get a Competitive Edge and to Future proove their businesses they just don't have a clue how and an obvious way for you to do business is by running an AI automation agency that offers businesses to implement it for them just a few years ago you heard people talk about AI automation agencies and it kind of wasn't something people took too seriously that has definitely changed take a look at what Liam otley is doing he is one great example if you know how to set up complex automation if you know how to fine tune and create Laura models and if you don't mind working with clients directly then consider offering your expertise as an AI consultant or through your own AI automation agency in the next 2 years I think we're going to see a ton of New Opportunities and a lot of amazing new ways to do business that's going to be different from the traditional SAS model these were five ideas on how to turn AI into an offer but another totally overlooked area is using AI for internal operations to run a more lean and efficient startup and in this video I will show you eight AI tools I use to run my business go watch this video next I will see you over there take care

TITLE: Replace Your Expensive Cloud Tools With These (Self-Hostable) Alternatives
VIDEO ID: vpiiqbpdkNk
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpiiqbpdkNk
================================================================================

I replaced six tools with free open- source and self- hostable Alternatives and it's saving me more than $10,000 every year and not only that my team and I got much more productive after changing these tools I bet you're already very familiar with notion sapure make air table post hog and a lot of other of these fashionable SAS tools but I also bet that you probably haven't heard of these free and self- hostable Alternatives that we replace them with so I want to bring them to your attention in this video I'll show you six amazing free tools that you can use to run your business if you're new to this channel welcome here I'm Simon harberg and I'm the founder of a SAS portfolio consisting of four bootstrapped SAS products to handle social media AI customer support link tracking and Graphics design we are a small and fully remote startup team and this year we are in the process of leaving the cloud and what better place to start than to replace a lot of the expensive SAS tools we use with free self hostable Alternatives that we host on our own servers let's go the first tool we're replacing is notion and I'll be honest it's actually a bit sad we changed from clickup to notion a few years back and it was such a massive Improvement and I got so hooked on this tool that I quickly ended up covering both internal vikii project management and for Content too we used notion together with make to write both newsletters and blog post directly in no's editor and then using automation to publish and send it out but notion was starting to run a bit expensive with their per seed pricing and if I'm being honest I think they're trying a bit too hard to become an everything app at least for my team and I things just started to get a bit chaotic so we're branching out three separate responsibilities and replacing them with each their own tool for internal Vicki and documentation we're now using dogmost it reminds a lot of notion but it only covers the do and notes part and it does that really well dog is completely free and open source and very easy to deploy to either your own servers or your Cloud platform of choice for project management we're now using plane very simple minimalistic project management tool that covers exactly what you need to collaborate no more no less you can self-host plane for free but they actually sell an upgraded version of their software as a lifetime deal it's $799 one time and then you get access to additional useful features such as Cycles time tracking and realtime collaboration we picked up this lifetime deal I can only recommend it finally for blogs and newsletters we're now using an actual CMS it's called strappy and it's a perfect solution for small teams if you can live without single sign on and support they have a free version that you can self host two other tools that we're getting really expensive for us were separ and make in all fairness we almost left separ all together throughout 2024 the whole platform experience was just getting unbearably slow and clunky for a long time make was our go-to it was a more lightweight faster and more affordable alternative to seure this worked well for a while until make started to feel more and more like sapure sluggish kind of clunky to navigate and as your workflows get more complex and start piling up prices get up there too so we made a decision and replaced both separ and make entirely with this tool called nadn not only do you get unlimited workflows if you self-host nadn but it is also a much much better tool n8n is a really powerful automation tool but it is also the tool that has the best fully working AI agent implementation I have tried I have a whole video where I show you how I build AI agents in naden I'll drop that at the end of this video so stick around for that the next tool on the list is our air table alternative to be honest I actually don't have anything negative to say about air T it's a wonderful tool it's been around for a long time and even though it's a total Beast it's still a delight to use it pricing is also fair but since we're already down the rabbit hole here we decided to replace air table with a free self- hostable alternative too and that's nood DB super cool air table alternative it's more simple but absolutely gets the job done and yes they have a free Community Edition that you can self host to and with a database tool like this it actually gives you the added benefit of keeping your data totally private when it's hosted on your own servers now as a SAS business you need analytics it is just such a super important part of your work I've used a bunch of different tools and the only ones that are decent are amplitude and post Haw both expensive both super clunky slow and endlessly frustrating to use and the thing is you still can't get them to report accurately ask anyone I don't don't know a single founder who doesn't struggle with analytics in one way or another and at some point accept that it's just never going to report exactly how you would like it until recently I made a decision a lot of people probably wouldn't agree with but it just finally works and it's free hear me out I set up a postris database started manually loging my events and then using Graff to visualize it I have never had better analytics than this I can use SQL to describe exactly how I want my data aggregated and visualized and grafana is surprisingly intuitive even though it's a pretty Advanced tool now I get product analytics where I have all other metrics as well as lcks it's super fast I can customize it exactly in the way I want and if you suck at SQL like I do chat gbt is very very good at it and it will help you get your queries just right so you can finally report things accurately as a bonus I want to add deep seek to the list I'm sure you've heard all about it but deep seek is a new AI model that performs on the same level as chat GPT but require much less resources and it's open source you can literally go to huging phas and download the models you can then either run these models locally if your computer has the right specs or if you have users to serve you can get a GPU line on hetner for just €84 per month and host the models here now you have your own chat GPT for a fixed monthly cost this is absolutely something I'm very excited to try out as you may know I'm offering lifetime access to all of my four SAS products for a single onetime purchase and when it comes to Lifetime deals keeping your cost low and predictable is crucial two of the products that are included in this offer are using AI quite extensively so if there's anything that can get me really excited it's the thought of AI at a fixed cost and it seems like we're finally getting there as always I have added links to all of these resources in the description below so please go check it out see if it's something you can use too and remember to go St them all on GitHub the acknowledgement means a whole lot for these projects if you want to see how I put together an AI agent using nadn and feed hve go watch this video next see you over there

TITLE: 8 AI Agents & Tools I Use to Make $1.6M / Year
VIDEO ID: 4RwMnSfqEOg
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RwMnSfqEOg
================================================================================

last year my SAS business generated more than $1 million in total revenue and it's on track to do at least 1.5 times more in 20125 but that's not even the most exciting part during last year I managed to increase our profit margin to almost 90% And the way I achieved this was to reduce the size of my team in 2024 we were nine people in total today we only four people left myself included and the reason I could pull this off is pretty pretty simple I replaced my team members with AI and in this video I want to show you the eight most high impact AI tools I use to run my seven figure SAS business and which areas of work they replaced every company is different for a typical SAS business you need to cover four areas of work operations customer support content creation and product development let's get started first of all we need an AI tool we can chat with directly for a long time the only real option was chat GPT from open AI but now we actually have quite a few different Alternatives and they're all becoming really good we have Claud which is now the preferred AI chat for many Founders I know we have deep seek which recently came out and it's giving really impressive results we have Gemini which is Google's version of chat gbt and we have llama which is open source the chat tool I find the most useful overall is still open AI chat GPT though Gemini is actually working really well when it comes to anything related to Maps so if I want to ask AI where I can get something in my local area jimini really does well here the most disappointing tool for me has been clot I subscribed to CLA two times in the last year and both times it was a very underwhelming experience both for coding content and just overall quality of outputs massive downside about chat gbt is that it's becoming really expensive they now have a $200 a month plan and it's just too much to ask in the market with so many good Alternatives so I'm actually using open a eyes models directly with this rapper called typing Minds it's basically a chat UI but connected directly to your open AI account this gives me much more value for the money than paying for chat gbg the next tool on my list is n8n I discovered this tool recently and it is an absolute blast it's an automation tool in the same category as sapier and make but much better you can use it to set up very Advanced automation just like you can do with Sapar and make but nadn allows you to jump into code whenever you need it so if you're a programmer you're getting much more flexibility here in fact you can use naden as a backend prototyping tool since you can set up your own API endpoints easily by using drag and drop it already supports Integrations with a whole lot of tools but one in particular is their AI agents you can connect n8n with your open AI account and create your own team of AI agents drag in an agent Noe add a model add memory now add all the tools the AI agent needs you can now ask this AI agent to perform a task and it will autonomously figure out the best way to use the tool to provide it in combination to carry out your task without having to wire a complex conditional automation flow together totally mind-blowing I'll give you a heads up if you subscribe to my channel which you absolutely should you're probably going to hear me talk a whole lot about this tool I'm not affiliated I'm just absolutely hooked on n8n let's move on and talk about customer support you can definitely set up a custom AI agent a custom rag and have a tool like NN handle customer support for you but if you want something you can set up much faster take a look at 8base 8base is an AI powered support system that comes with everything included you can train an AI model on your own data such as your website PDF files and even YouTube videos and then place a customer support chat directly on your website you can also manage a custom knowledge base directly from a base you can set up the AI to assist you with tickets and emails so it's the perfect mix between a fully autonomous agent-based support system and an email and ticketing system where humans are the first line of support but assisted by Ai and to be fully transparent here 8 Bas is one of the S products my team and I run we're super proud of this product because it is in my opinion one of the best tools on the market right now to carry the heavy load of customer support especially for small and bootstrapped teams but yeah I'm obviously biased if you want to try eight base we have a 7-Day free trial and right now you can actually get lifetime access to eight Bas for a single onetime purchase it's a part of our founder stack offer which includes four powerful SAS Tools in bundled lifetime deal you can go to founder stack. proo and see everything that's included in this offer now let's move on to content creation for all things related to image and video generation I use replicate this is a platform where you can run and fine-tune open source AI models like stable diffusion flux and much more one of the models I use the most is Fox which is considered the best image generation model at this moment it's much better than mid journey and Dolly and with replicate I can use these models directly without having to worry about how they run replicate would take my prompt they'll spin up the GPU instances needed to run the model and give me the output and the coolest part is that you can also fine-tune many of these models directly on replicate I fine-tuned a custom version of flux a so-called Laura model by uploading a bunch of images of my myself and now I can create hyper realistic thumbnails with myself in them using AI all my latest thumbnails here on this channel it's all created by this Laura model you can also create video sound and a whole lot of other things they have a massive catalog of preconfigured models ready to use if you've been watching my videos recently you might have noticed that I'm using a lot of CGI and 3D to enhance the viewer experience and frankly to make the whole process of creating videos much more fun obviously the background behind me is CG even the things on the table in front of me are CG and if you thought I had a whole VFX team working with me or paid some agency to produce these videos I don't blame you in reality I taught myself some very basic blender skills and then I just use AI a whole lot and when basic prompting falls short I use a tool called comfy UI just like replicate this allows you to run open- Source diffusion models but with from the UI you really get fine grain control you can create very custom pipelines and flows using a node-based system this will allow you to pipe the output of one model into another model and use so-called control Nets with depth maps and outlines to guide the output of an image model much better I can even use it to recreate entire environments in 3D by substituting individual parts of very basic 3D scenes I use this a lot for cheap 3D D so because I'm not a 3D artist by any means I can use comy UI to create images that will enhance my very basic blender Clips it gets much more advanced than simply using replicate but you can still use it entirely without having to code you can run comfy UI in the cloud using a tool like run comfy but you can also install it and run it locally another really handy and much more simple tool to create 3D is sey depth I use this a lot in combination with flux soy depth is a simple AI tool that will take an image and predict the depth of the image which can be used to turn a flat 2D image into 3D so I'll basically generate a starting image of the environment I want using flux then I'll upload this to se depth and use AI to create a 3D mesh from this image now I can bring this mesh into after effects and with a few adjustments I have this 3D like environment that I can Us in my scene so this requires no blender no Advanced diffusion model setups just a simple image SE depth and some very basic 3D directly in After Effects and most often people don't really care if it looks perfectly realistic so it's just a fairly low effort way to spice up your videos and have something that stands out from the crowd of course you can argue that all of this is completely un necessary though I think production value matters and I think these tools can help you create content that lead leaves a more memorable impression until everyone starts doing this of course then we'll have to come up with something new the next one is feed hiive which is an AI powered social media management tool I use feed hiive to manage and schedule all my content for social media it covers all the major platforms like LinkedIn YouTube Instagram Tik Tok and many more it has a lot of useful AI tools built into the platform for instance you can access an AI assistant that is fine-tuned for Content directly where you write your posts you can also use V dive to predict how well your post will do and have it give suggestions to edit your post in a way that is likely to get better reach and the coolest part is feed hiive has built-in support for automation so it can be used in an AI agent workflow On Tools like nadn that's exactly how I create most of my content once again full transparency feed diive is another tool my team and I run it's a part of the SAS portfolio that you can get full access to as a part of our founder stack offer so you can get both abase and Feed diive plus two other tools lifetime access for a single onetime purchase I highly recommend that you go check out founder stack. proo again Link in the description finally let's talk about product development one tool I use a lot is cursor cursor is a code editor similar to vs code it ships with a lot lot of AI tooling built into the software and it's a total GameChanger now there are two ways you can use cursor the first one is if you are an experienced software engineer you can use cursor to autocomplete code not only will it finish your sentences but it also predicts where the next change in the code should be and enables you to jump directly to the edit so it's this super cool tap tap tap experience extremely useful for productivity the other one is for people with no coding experience at all cuz you can actually tell cursor what you want in natural language and it will help you put an entire code base together for you I've seen some people do this with both web apps and mobile apps and it's wild to see how people who don't know code code I would argue though that if you don't know code at all you're probably still better off using no code tools where the code is generated behind the scenes using certain restriction and guard rails letting AI code freely for like this without knowing what's going on is probably quickly going to get out of hand AI is here to stay and it will help you run your business in 10x mode if you let it now let me show you step by step how to use nadn and feed hiive to set up an AI agent that will create content for your brand all by itself I'll show you in this video click here to watch it and I will see you over there

TITLE: I Made +$160K Selling SaaS Lifetime Deals
VIDEO ID: Zq2yLyc4fi0
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq2yLyc4fi0
================================================================================

for almost two years my S products were stuck no matter what I tried I wasn't able to grow revenue and as more new users were coming in I kept getting knocked down by high acquisition costs expensive ad placements and churn then a few months ago I made a Bald Move one that changed everything in fact it seems like it's turning my entire business around with an increase in revenue of more than 56% so far other Founders told me not to do it cuz this move is a Founders Nightmare and a total game changer at the same time it's just not sustainable it's a race to the bottom don't ever sell your sass on a lifetime a lifetime deal a lifetime a lifetime deal a lifetime deal a lifetime yes I did the thing Founders will tell you to avoid at all cost and in this video I'll explain why most of them got it wrong let's start by outlining some of the most common objections you get against running a lifetime deal on the founder side we get that it's unsustainable you'll get a single payment for infinite ongoing cost to run your servers and to offer support that the audience is problematic we're often told that lifetime users are especially demanding and entitled and that it will hurt your current subscriber base lifetime deal simply cannot coexist with a subscriber base your current subscribers will churn and on the user side we get one major objection and it's all about trust how does the user know that you won't just take their money and shut down your business shortly after and the thing is these are all completely valid concerns there's a reason why so many Founders will warn you to not go down this path and why so many users frown upon this concept but as it turns out there are just three things we need to implement in order to make all of these issues go away now how do I know this let's get into it two months ago my team and I launched Founders deck it's a bundled lifetime offer that will give you access to four tools to handle social media AI support link tracking and Graphics design these are the SAS products my team and I built over the past four years for single onetime purchase you'll get lifetime access to these four tools as well as two new SAS products that we haven't launched yet but will come later this year and this offer has been selling really well but that's actually not the full story one of these products feed hiive was on appsumo back in 2022 appsumo is a Marketplace for Lifetime deals and feed hiive was there for a 2mon long campaign and it was crushing it was among the top five bestselling products in this period it generated more than $300,000 in total revenue and we onboarded more than 5,000 lifetime users later that same year I pre we sold lifetime deals for early adopters of Link drip before we launched that product many of these users are still with us today 3 years later so we happen to have a lot of data and a lot of insight about these users how they use our platform and how the economics around lifetime deals actually work and I think it's safe to say that a lot of the things you hear simply isn't true first of all there's this idea that a lifetime user never CHS how can they it's not like there's a subscription to cancel you took their money now you're stuck with them forever they will be in your support channels grinding your servers eating up AI credits and costing your money for a lifetime what a shortsighted investment into your business but the thing is it's not true lifetime users do turn and they turn for just about the same reason subscribers turn some go out of business and they don't need your tool anymore some outgrow Your solution and they need something bigger some start Outsourcing what your solution did to a third party agency that has its own tool chain and some move on to a shiny new tool that promises to solve their problems in a totally different way and the list goes on the point is that even if a user paid for a lifetime deal you can be certain that eventually they too will turn just like a subscriber will let me show you what I mean here we have two groups of users one group is a mix of yearly and monthly subscribers the other one is a group of people who bought a lifetime deal let's have them raise down this cohort we'll see how long it takes for each of them to drop off as we can see it seems like the lifetime users stick around a little bit longer before they eventually start turning two though seems like someone forgot to start running altogether this is Jonathan Jonathan isn't exactly like other users he he doesn't have an urgent need for your tool right now so he would never become a subscriber but Jonathan has Big Dreams he wants to start his own business and he knows that once he's ready to make the big move these tools will become very useful Jonathan knows how to spot a great deal when he sees it and he considers purchases like these an investment into the future but the problem with Jonathan is that that big day when he's going to make his big move just doesn't seem to ever come so he buys the tools and then he puts them on the Shelf but he never redeems it and he never becomes a user and you would be surprised how many users just like Jonathan will be on your list of buyers Jonathan is an instant Turner from a data perspective he buys and leaves immediately when we account for these types of users our cohort actually changes quite a bit as we can see the average lifetime user actually ends up turning before the average subscriber so no don't worry you're not going to be stuck with your lifetime users Forever at least far from all of them and now that we know that all we need to do is pick a price that's high enough that the average lifetime user won't get to become a losing investment before they turn that's the first thing on the list set a relatively high price point for your offer we're selling founders deack for7 $199 for all four tools for us this is The Sweet Spot it's still a great deal for other users and given our current cost per user we're not going to be in the danger zone of this deal becoming unsustainable anytime soon since we launched founder stack around 230 people have picked up this deal they have generated more than $160,000 in total revenue so the question is how long do you think it take for these people to become a net negative investment for us 2 years 3 years not even close it will take this group of users around 37 years before they will even enter the danger zone of losing US money so yes on paper it's true that if you charge a user once who imposes ongoing costs you will eventually start losing money but most people just wildly exaggerate how narrow this Horizon actually is in 37 years these users won't be using our tool anymore I know it's a lifetime deal but let's be real in 37 years I'll be an old man looking back at life even if some of these users are still using feed diive it's at least not going to be my problem by that time but there's an important point to be made here the reason this timeline is so long is partially because we're charging a high price but it's also because we're good at keeping our cost low which is the second thing on our list if you can price reasonably high and at the same time keep a very tight cost control when operating your business you're safe this means selling simple but specialized tools they should be fully self-served and the need for support should be super low no demo calls no presentations and sales meetings no manual onboarding no designated customer success agents or account managers none of that it's way too expensive keep your products low touch and selfs serve make a big deal out of the product onboarding experience and have a lot of guides tutorials and videos ready so the user can help themselves effectively if you're pricing too low and your product cost too much to run this is where you get into trouble so when you plan for this make safe conservative estimates finally one big concern people have is the impact a lifetime deal will have on their current subscriber base base in our case we lost 10 subscribers these users canceled their subscription and replaced it with founder stack which means that only around 4.5% of our founder stack buyers are current subscribers but here's where it gets interesting we can track at least 15 new subscribers who originally found us through the founder stack website so even though Founders stack did cause some subscribers to leave it has still netted us five new subscribers I can't explain this conclusively but my theory is that this again has to do with the high price point for instance a lot of our users are on a $29 a month feed diive plan and they're set they don't need eight Bas link driven tiny Qi and $799 is quite a lot compared to the $29 a month they're currently paying even if it's a one-time purchase and the other one is recurring and as for the new subscribers I'm guessing that some of them might just want to try out the tools for a few months before buying founder stack or they heard about our tools through the founder stack promotion but again only needed one of them I'm not entirely sure here but my clear impression is that if the price distance is big enough you probably don't have to worry that your entire subscriber base is jumping this ship grabbing your lifetime deal all at once now there's one last thing we need to talk about and that's trust unfortunately deal sites like EP suumo pitch ground and deal mirror have made it a little too tempting for certain Bad actors to exploit the lifetime deal business model there have been cases where Founders do the LTD version of a pump and dump they list their tool on appsumo and then they hype up their road map and make some insane promises about what's coming and what the lifetime users will get they grab the cash and then they close down 3 months later and say oops we went bankrupt startup is hard everyone knows the risk so on and so on obviously super shady and then there are more well-intended founders who just get way ahead of themselves they'll sell a lifetime deal for $39 which uses AI extensively and has a super high cost and as we've already discovered that's a safe way to actually go bankrupt in a short time and yes this has happened many times so a lot of LCD buyers have become a bit skeptical there's only one way to get around this issue and it's the last thing on our list we need to prioritize building a strong reputation you as the founder should be the public face of your company you should be on social media on YouTube and people's emails building trust you should demonstrate that you are a responsible person that you're not just going to run this company into the ground just like that and that you will to the best of your ability give your users what you promis them if you're hiding behind your company if you're invisible if people can't reach you it's going to be hard if not impossible to sell your products this way whether a lifetime deal or traditional subscriptions are best for your business only you can tell but before you blindly reject the idea of a lifetime deal I think you at least owe it to yourself to entertain the thought just make sure you have these three things covered thanks for watching

TITLE: How I Generate +100 SaaS Ideas
VIDEO ID: 1oDRa8DzVkw
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oDRa8DzVkw
================================================================================

every year I generate hundreds of new SAS ideas I put a dozen of them to the test and I launch at least one so how do I do this well I'm here on the public Street of the internet and I use what we all have publicly available in this video I'll show you the exact framework I use to generate hundreds of potential sass ideas every year first of all if you're new to this channel welcome here I'm Simon and I am what you would call a diversified entrepreneur and one of the ways I've become that is by running a portfolio of small SAS products instead of going all in on one big idea in 2022 I launched my first product feed highp later that year I launched link drip in 2023 I acquired a small tool called tiny kiwi and again later in 2023 I launched eight base these products are all bootstrapped profitable and driving Revenue but how do I succeed every time truth is I don't what you're seeing are the few ones that succeeded behind the scenes I have been dappling with hundreds of sass ideas I've put at least a few dozens to the test and in the end only a few came out on the other side and this is exactly what I recommend that you do don't go all in don't put all your money on red play a safe and diversified game now let me show you the framework I use to generate hundreds of ideas for potential SAS businesses first of all I'm a huge fan of building and already established markets I want to build here on a busy internet street with tons of traffic you don't need to innovate you can simply build an alternative to a tool users already know but build for users who are unsatisfied with the current solution so how do we do that let's go to reddit.com go to the search bar on top and type in alternative 2 then hit enter you're going to see a long list of posts where people ask alternative to Tool now you want to do the following open every item that you find interesting or relevant for every item go explore the website of the tool in question now read the Reddit post and find the reason why the user is looking for an alternative of course not all posts are going to be relevant here some will be old and some will be very far from something you would know or even be interested in trying to solve so we need to filter these a bit for each of these posts ask yourself the following questions is it viable for me to build an alternative be honest with yourself here don't commit to something way over the top stick to topics that you feel somewhat confident about getting into can I address the complaints the user is having again be honest with yourself here sometimes lack of feat featur is there for a reason what the user is asking might simply not be viable to solve now filter all your open tabs based on the above questions hopefully you're left with one or two tabs open still I got one here a my alternative interesting now before we go ahead and start setting up a Myro alternative we might want to have a bit more than a single Reddit comment to base our tool on in case you didn't know G2 is a product review website it's similar to trust pilot but they make a much bigger deal out of verifying the reviewers which makes most reviews more relevant and actionable this is exactly what we need let's head over to g2.com in the search bar let's type in the name of the product we're building an alternative for we can now see all the reviews for this product if we scroll down we'll find a place that says sort by and pick lowest rated that's right we want to find more people who are unsatisfied with this product and we want to know what they dis like so we can explore if building an alternative is an option let's start looking through these reviews even though G2 makes a big deal out of verifying their reviews a lot of reviews are still fairly relevant but once we start looking further we'll find reviews like this one amazing super valuable information here the website gets laggy it's hard to navigate using the interface is difficult and there's no way to revert changes back to a specific point in time these already really good Clues ideally we want to look for reviews that are recent no older than 3 months specific they should address specific pain points actionable they should describe how the user would have wanted it instead the goal is to find at least 5 to 10 additional reviews from people who are struggling with the platform and see if we can find some Comon patterns between them and if they're all mentioning the same issues we might have a potential SAS idea in this case a more lightweight Myro alternative that's easier to use and runs much faster in the browser not bad now let me just make something clear nothing can beat good qualitative research like the thing we're doing right here it's boring and sometimes very tedious work but as the founder you should be doing this that being said a lot have changed on the streets of the internet recently and we would be missing out if we didn't do this last thing let's visit the new building down the street this is where things get really exciting first let's go find a Chrome extension called Go full page this will allow you to take full page screenshots of any website there we go now let's take a screenshot of at least the first three full pages of bad reviews on D2 like that and if you want to you can expand on this step you can go search on trust pilot Capa find Facebook reviews anywhere on the internet where people have something to say about your product at this step we care a little less about the quality of the data we just want a lot of it let's go and upload these images to chat GPT next we're going to use this prompt not going to read it all aloud but I will leave it in the description so you can copy paste let's replace these and there we go now chat gpg will take all of these reviews and output a very detailed business case and finish up with a very specific outline for a SAS idea now combine this with your own research that you did in step two and you might actually have something very cool to work off from here now before you rush into this new idea let me give you a serious piece of advice wait a bit let the idea sit for a bit before making a move create an ocean dog add the idea to an idea database let a week or two pass then revisit it and see if you're still excited about working on it in those two weeks either one of two things will typically happen you'll forget about it and start thinking about something else or your mind will keep going on and on about it if it's one of these ideas you just can't seem to let go of it might be a good candidate to take to the next level and remember you're a diversified entrepreneur even if it's a great idea you still shouldn't bit everything on it you should push this idea forward along with a series of other ideas and for that you need an entire SAS Factory in this video I'll show you exactly how to build a sass Factory step by step go watch that one now see you over there

TITLE: Launching a SaaS with Almost No Money
VIDEO ID: p7MXYzS6Fr8

================================================================================

you want to start a business but the problem is you're poor you have close to no money to get started but don't worry times have changed today you can build a fully-fledged SAS business on a budget and in this video I'll show you how I'll cover which tools you need to build and run your SAS and I'll cover which marketing channels you need to grow it and I'll give you entirely free or at least the cheapest versions of all all of them let's go if you're new to this channel welcome here I'm Simon harberg founder of a SAS portfolio consisting of four profitable and entirely bootstrapped SAS products my products are generating more than a million dollars per year and I can proudly say that I never raised a single Dollar in funding so I know how important it is to balance growth operations and a tight cost control and with that said let's start by talking about product and operations I'll cover this from both a coding and a no code perspective first and foremost you need a website all businesses need a website and there are various great options here some built their websites from scratch using nextjs and hosted on verell others buil it using no code tools like web flow or framer but the problem is they all get expensive fairly fast some with fixed cost and others with increasing prices as traffic goes up and since cost is our main focus I would go in a completely different direction setion I would host my website on GitHub Pages which is completely free it's been around for a long time but I still often meet people who are not aware that you can actually turn your GitHub repository into a website totally free of charge no surprise fees no bandwidth limitations and no hidden charges your website will be powered by github's global CDN which is really reliable and really fast now you have two options if you're a programmer and you prefer coding your website from scratch you can use a static site generator like nextjs if you're a no code person and you prefer a no code tool I suggest taking a look at this excellent template generator called Shuffle go to shuffle. deev now you can create your website in a no code editor and then export the whole thing so it's ready to be hosted on GitHub Pages you can buy access to shuffle on a lifetime deal but you can also upgrade just for a single month export the site and then downgrade in theory you can do the same with webflow framer and so on they also support exporting your code I've done it a few times and the code of exports is a crazy mess web flow is the worst one here it's really really not elegant at all I recommend Shuffle because it's really easy to use and because the code at the exports is very tidy and very nicely organized you can have a website running in a few hours this way now we need a place to host the SAS Product 2 which is typically some form of dynamic web app again I see a lot of people opting for services like versel super base Heroku and so on but here's the thing I generally wouldn't recommend using these services and since cost is our priority here I most certainly wouldn't recommend them all of these tools run on the cloud provider AWS under the hood and they put a pretty aggressive margin on top of cost when I acquired tiny Q one of the sest products in my portfolio it was running on superbase and it cost us almost $160 per month to run this simple small tool and superbase would crash all the time making it an unbearable user experience for many of our users we migrated the whole thing to AWS which is what super Bas is already using they just have a more polished UI on top and the cost is now around $12 per month from $160 to $12 per month imagine how this would look if the tool messed ly scaled hey if you can afford it and you think their UI on top makes your life that much easier buy all means but since cost is our main priority in this video here's what I would do instead if you want to build your Solution on the cloud use either of the three big ones that power mostly all Cloud Solutions today it's AWS Google Cloud platform and asro all other Cloud tools you might find out there simply built on top of their infrastructure and they charge an unre reasonable margin on top personally I recommend using AWS it's the biggest by far and you can save a whole lot of money by using it directly instead of all those other smaller tools now while that being said there's another movement going on you probably noticed that more and more Tech businesses including bootstrap startups and Indie creators are moving away from the cloud entirely even the big cloud platforms like AWS still have unpredictable prices lack of transpar guant and simplicity in how they charge their customers and down the line for a lot of small companies it's just too expensive for what you get people want something smaller simpler more efficient and more affordable in a lot of ways like it was before the era of the cloud so I want to share a super cool alternative it's called coolify coolify is a collection of tools that make up most of the things you get in the cloud but it's open source and you can self-host it it's very easy and intuitive to use and you can install it more or less anywhere you want I suggest rening a machine on hetner and install coolify on it now you have your own little Cloud for $50 a month fixed price everything included it is really awesome my SAS portfolio is currently hosted on AWS but we're actually in the process of leaving the Cloud 2 and we're using a dedicated server on hner for this I can highly recommended now let's take a look at some of the more operational Parts down the line you need to use some Automation and this is one of the areas where no code really shines most likely you've already been using tools like sapure make and air table they are really great tools but they also run expensive relatively fast so I want to give you some lowcost and free Alternatives instead of using sapure take a look at papley it's very similar you can get access to papley connect on a lifetime purchase instead of paying separ every month paple covers a whole lot of Integrations and it's very likely that they already have exactly what you need instead of air table take a look at Bas row it covers a lot of the same use cases as air table and the best part is it's open source and you can self host it just like coolify and now you have a free air table effectively you also need to send out emails and for this I recommend using AWS they have a service called SES now someone from AWS do need to approve of your use case before you can send out emails but once you're approved you'll get a higher deliverability than most other services and it is ridiculously much more affordable than tools like syrid and MailChimp and just as a small kicker here notion has an API if you're like me and you also love using notion you can turn your notion into a small DIY custom management system and newsletter editor because we're using S sces to send out emails we write them all in notion it's super easy to turn a notion document into HTML which we can use to send to our users same with blog posts we write all our blog posts in notion and simply use their API to generate the HTML for our websites and notion is to a large extent free as a startup there are at least four things you need to have covered you need to post on social media you need scroll stopping visuals you need to handle customer support and you need to track where your traffic is coming from if you want to use the industry leading tools for this it gets very expensive very very fast but I have something amazing to share with you relaunching Founders stack this is the ultimate suffers deck for Founders and it includes access to the full Suite of SAS tools my team and I have worked tirelessly in the past four years to build and here's the best part this is a lifetime deal you will get instant lifetime access to feed dive eight8 Bas link drip and Tiny Qi for a single onetime purchase it's a complete solution for your startup covering social media marketing AI chat and ticket support link shortening and access to more than 5,000 professionally crafted design templates yours forever for a single onetime purchase and call me crazy but there's more my team and I are already working on two new SAS products that we're launching in 2025 and if you buy bu founder stack today you will automatically get lifetime access to these two new tools when they launch head over to founder stack. proo and log in this deal today now let's shift our focus and talk about marketing we're so fortunate to live in a time where everyone can do marketing completely for free so I want to share some of my favorite marketing channels you can use on a budget but remember the Freer it is the harder it is nothing is cheap and easy at the same time so what you save in cash you have to put down in time and effort instead there is no way around that the first category is content and in my experience the best place to reach people for free is here on YouTube there are more than 120 million people watching 1 billion hours of content on this platform every single day video content is the future I think most marketers agree on this what some people to disagree on is the matter of long form versus short form content it's probably true that some short form content has the potential to reach more people but data strongly suggests that it doesn't have nearly as big of an impact on the viewer as long form content has it's all about trust there's a study that suggests that it takes 40 to 60 hours to form a friendship and in the online version this is what's called a parasocial relationship which basically means that the feeling of knowing someone only goes one way for instance I'm here talking to a camera right now and truth is I probably don't know who you are but if you've been watching my content for a while you might almost feel like you know me and you might feel this way with a lot of your favorite creators this is a parasocial relationship and it's an incredibly strong component in marketing but with short firm content it's difficult to have viewers consume 40 to 60 hours of you on video it's just much easier to achieve with long form content so simply put it builds a connection and it builds trust much more effectively the written equivalent of this is blog post and articles so if you're not comfortable being on camera you can achieve a similar effect by writing long form content medium is a super popular platform and it's available to everyone you can also choose social media platforms like LinkedIn or Reddit both platforms with massive user bases and people there are used to consume longer posts you can even write articles on LinkedIn of course course you can still post on places like Twitter threats blue sky and so on they're great but don't make these platforms your first priority stick to places where you can write longer posts and where the average user typically has a bit more patience to sit and read the next marketing channel is SEO of course writing blog posts targeting longtail keywords with lower search volume so you can compete as the standard approach to using SEO it's the way most people do it and I'm not saying it's bad many startups both big and small all use this channel to drive traffic and you probably should too but there's another approach to SEO that I don't hear people mention that often and especially if you're a developer you will probably love this it's an approach marketers Call engineering as marketing or as I like to call it micr products the idea is very simple instead of showing up on Google with an article when people search you show up with a small tool for instance if I search for LinkedIn video download I'll see free tools from SAS Rel related to social media if I search for profit margin calculator tools like Shopify will show up with a small free tool and these tools are very helpful for SEO they drive traffic they get shared often and they help build up overall domain Authority and of course when people visit these tools there's often some call to action that prompts the visitor to try out the full solution so if you know how to put small tools like this together whether it's code or no code it's an excellent organic marketing strategy but how do you figure out which keyword to Target you probably know tools like ARs and Sim rush and they certainly makes life easier but since we're on a budget here let me show you an easier way go to Google start writing a few relevant words and see what Google suggests after those words the first five suggestions are probably pretty good longtail keywords to show up on if you can yeah it's that simple I recommend that you get at least content and SEO nailed down but on top of that there are a few approaches you can use to improve your reach one way is to build a viral Loop into your product there are countless ways this can be done and it can be as simple as a powered by link on your forms embeds or Widgets or in emails that your service sends on behalf of your users on one of my products eight base there's a powered by link on our chat widget which people put on the websites and it has a link at the bottom of the support emails users sent when they use our product in this way users bring in more users who bring in more users so on another really effective way to have users promote your product is by using affiliate marketing in this way you share some of the revenue each new user brings in but you aren't paying anything upfront so if you're on a budget this can be a really effective way to get your product off ground I've seen some startups offer 30 40 even 50% of the revenue of each new subscriber they bring recur ly and it's really something that motivates affiliate Partners to go that extra mile to promote your product finally if all you have to get started is your phone start reaching out to people try to be helpful create a network this is something you should do before you start building your product you want to create a relationship with people and give before you ask so if you haven't launched your first product yet start doing that today and in order to create a small recurring Revenue stream to get you started check out these four business ideas that will get you to $1,000 Mr fast thanks for watching

================================================================================

if you're just getting started with your first online business getting to 10,000 Mr 20,000 Mr or even 83333 Mr if you know you know can seem incredibly overwhelming almost impossible to imagine if you're already on track to hit these goals that's awesome keep doing what you're doing but if you're not maybe you're not even close maybe you haven't made your first dollar online yet then this video is for you if you're just starting out you should focus on hitting your first m Stone of $1,000 monthly recurring revenue and in this video I'll show you four ways that might not be big million dollar s ideas but they will get you to $1,000 Mr much easier and faster than most other approaches let's go let me start by showing you a few popular Indie tools and see if you can spot what these have in common it looks like they're all cutting itch AI tools right well they kind of are but there's a catch it's not easy to see but if you were to open these tools and look under the hood here's roughly what the underlying architecture would look like these tools are what we call rappers and it's the first approach I would consider they basically take existing technology like open AI replicate and 11 laps which are created by some really really smart people then use the API for these tools and wrap it in their own UI so the scope of these tools is really just a front end and don't get me wrong I'm not talking these Founders down they are incredibly good at what they do which is spotting a great business opportunity and then marketing it on social media for profit some of these tools are generating tents even hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly and as more emerging new AI technology pops up I think there's a ton of potential here right now they typically use open AI to R text based SAS products such as chat Bots and content writers they use replicate to run diffusion models used for image generation and they use Luma to create video from text and use 11 labs to create speech and audio but new tools pop up all the time and many of them offer API access from the beginning of course the biggest downside is that these tools aren't cheap so the trade-off from building a rapper is that you'll rely on some other tools that eat a good bite of your margin but then again if you're aiming for a tool that's easy to build easy to maintain and can get you somewhere in the ,000 Mr range fast then I would definitely look into building a rapper instead of building a more complex product the next approach I would consider is something that takes a bit more time to set up initially and in most cases requires a little more technical knowledge however once it's created it has the potential to generate Revenue more or less passively the idea is simple you're going to sell something that saves other people a ton of time so they get to sell what they're building much faster I am of course talking about boiler plates and starter kits and yes I know there are a ton of boiler plates on the market already so why would you build yet another barlar plate because the market is always evolving and even though there are a lot of bar plates out there many of them are either outdated bloated or missing key features for today's Tex stack remember this is heavily tied to preference there's almost always room for another tool even if it's just a slightly different version of something that already already exists some people will prefer yours what I've seen work well is focusing on a specific KNE or Tech trend for example maybe you create a boiler plate specifically for S startups that integrate modern tools like stripe and tailor and CSS out of the box or maybe you focus on something that developers can use as a foundation for their own products like a romate template for an AI powered app that leverages open AI heck you could build a rapper boiler plate that will help people build rappers faster what's great about this approach is that once you've built the boiler plate you can sell it over and over again with very little maintenance and as more people discover your product it essentially becomes a passive income stream the key here is making sure your boiler plate truly solves a problem and is well documented so people can get up and running with minimal friction and boiler plates aren't just for developers either there's an increasing demand for pre-made Design Systems UI kits and no code templates too so if you're more design oriented this could be your opportunity to create a resource that helps the signers or no coders save time and remember you don't need to become the lead boiler plate or dominate this Market in any way to produce $1,000 per month consistently this way okay let's explore something a bit more futuristic this isn't really a fully developed market yet but it's definitely coming up a year ago open AI announced custom gpts and people immediately saw a huge business opportunity here some people even call this the new app store marketplace where you can build custom gbts specialized agents that you can market and sell directly from open ai's platform and it flopped no one's talking about this anymore and I don't think anyone in their right Minds would pay to have access to a custom GPT today mostly because let's face it they suck they don't really do anything different than the normal chat gbg but that doesn't mean the idea itself is bad one of the S products I run is 8base which is an AI powered support tool and one of its primary task is to train AI models on users data what I can tell you is if you're using the right techniques you can absolutely make a custom chatbot really good I have an AI version of myself hosted on my website I call it Simon Ai and I have people talking to it picking my brain every day now mine is totally free to access but I am absolutely convinced that you could charge for a highly specialized AI chatbot like this if you're a lawyer specializing in something specific you could train a custom AI model on your expertise and sell access at a low price if you're a fitness coach with a specific expert domain you could create an AI agent trained on Fitness plans and nutrition advice tailored specifically for people with specific dietary needs if you're a financial adviser with expertise and using specific investment instruments you could create an AI agent that will give advice on exactly this the key here is specialized knowledge chat DBT CLA llama they're all really good but they're very generic I firmly believe that people would pay to access specialized domain level AI agents especially if they're backed by training data on real life experts with the right credentials the only catch is you can't use open AI custom gbts for this they do utterly suck you need to go through the trouble of fine-tuning your models though it's not as hard as you might think and open AI has excellent documentation on how to do this would you like a video where I show you how to do this please leave a comment below and let me know all right let's shift gears when most of us hear monthly recurring Revenue we think about SAS typically when we talk about more traditional service businesses or e-commerce businesses we don't use the term recurring Revenue even though both agencies and e-com businesses are heavily focused on repeat buyers too if you're a freelancer or you run an agency I bet you know exactly what I'm talking about here but in imagine if you could capture these repeat buyers on an actual subscription just like you would on a SAS before your agency instead this is exactly what some small agencies have started doing and it's working surprisingly well you might have heard about popular design agencies like design Jor design me but this could work with any kind of service business like web development marketing social media management and so on and here's the trick to make this model sustainable you have to productize your service so what what does that mean it means turning your service into a packaged offer with clear deliverables that are repeatable instead of Custom Tailoring every project you set boundaries on what you'll provide each month for instance a set number of designs or updates to a website this way the work doesn't pile up and you can serve multiple clients without burning out by prioritizing your services you make it easier for clients to understand exactly what they're paying for and it makes your life way more manageable because you can systemize and streamline the delivery but why would customers want to sign up for a subscription like this in the first place the answer is simple peace of mind and convenience some businesses don't want to be constantly searching for Freelancers or agencies to solve small problems that pop up every month they need ongoing support and they want to know that they have someone reliable to handle it whether it's updating their website creating new graphics or managing their social media presence let's say you charge $500 per month you only need two clients to hit that $1,000 mark four clients at 250 per month you've hit your target now the focus on these four approaches is to get a monthly recurring revenue of $1,000 but none of these ideas are restricted to that in fact most of the examples I brought here is making much more than that so while these ideas are I would say great beginner friendly business ideas there's nothing that prevents you from scaling this into $10,000 or $220,000 Mr if you want me to expand on any of these approaches let me know in the comments and I'll consider turning that into a video on its own if you got value please give this video a like And subscribe to my channel for more

TITLE: How to Build a SaaS Factory - Ship 10x Faster
VIDEO ID: z5U843Ob8xw
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5U843Ob8xw
================================================================================

welcome to my SAS Factory this is where I built my SAS product I used this place to create eight base feed hiive link drip and a lot of other products you haven't even heard of this seems broken SAS became really competitive let's face it going all in on a SAS is risky constantly testing the market with new ideas is the best way to increase your chances of success but you need the right tooling to do this sustainably and in this video I'll show you how you can build a SAS Factory just like this for yourself and I'll show you what to avoid at all cost the reality is that it is statistically overwhelmingly likely that your s product will fail if you're a beginner and it's your first product it's extremely likely almost a guarantee but even some of the biggest and most successful business owners are playing this game take a look at Amazon Google Apple Microsoft they all have a massive graveyard of failed product much much bigger than their portfolio of successful products if you take a look at the most successful Indie hackers it's the same deal the reason they're successful is that they've been pushing and failing more and faster than most other people and this is why you should build a SAS Factory to make it easier for you to test new new products launch new products and take new products to Market faster the first thing we need is a place to store code here let me show you in here we have a lot of packages containing a lot of code we have custom utilities that we use over and over packages to easily manipulate lists themes utility functions to handle common stripe operations and much more these are packages we install in mostly all new projects because they help speed up common operations such as login user permissions subscription workspaces managing teams and so on and we also have a lot of templates and boiler plates the tech stack this Factory is built on is using react chakra UI AWS and palumi and every new project we built comes out on the very same teex deack we have boiler plates that enable us to spin up a fully functional SAS including a backend front end authentication payment and a basic UI in less than 30 minutes all new products start from here the key is to stay organized in the Heat and excitement of building a new SAS people especially Indie hackers tend to under prioritize this in order to build this part of the factory you need just one thing a GitHub organization now get into the habit of stopping regularly go through your code and pick out pieces that you know or at least feel very sure could be reused re Factor it and turn it into a general purpose solution then push it to a repository on GitHub and turn it into an npm package you can install in future projects and try to think of future U be nice to Future U spend some time writing a nice read me with documentation and get started instructions the same goes for the boiler plates although these do take a bit more work and effort on GitHub you can turn a repository into a template and with a click of a button you'll have a new repository ready using the boiler plate with our full stack SAS boiler plate we even created a small CLI so when we first start a project we're taking through a few questions and choices and boom the new SAS is ready soon enough you will have a GitHub organization filled with packages boiler plates gists code Snippets starter guides including all the things you need to set up a base for new SAS fast hey Simon yes what is it the latest SAS broke again it seems like the version of chakra is out of date can't you ask Devon to look into it he tried but he couldn't figure it out okay I I'll look into it thanks yes this takes time to set up and yes you do need to maintain this since you need to keep your packages updated and compatible with each other but trust me once this part of your SAS Factory is well developed and running you're going to save hundreds if not thousands of hours on probably the most expensive part of your SAS business engineering the next thing we need is a place for no code automation this is one of our most important rooms people have this idea that it's either code or no code but in order to build a proper SAS Factory you should have both we're using tools like sapure and make to perform a lot of backend operations that include third-party tools when we add new users to a retargeting list for Facebook and Google we we use no code automation when we segment users in a list for email drips we use no code automation when we write product updates and notion and push it to feed hiive to share on social media we use no code automation when new users sign up and we add the sale to a spreadsheet for financial planning we use no code Automation in fact we use no code automation for a long list of things that are not directly related to the back end of the app and includes third party tools and why not turn this into a library of no code templates that can be reused here's what a lot of you don't know sapier has an excellent integration platform that allows you to create custom Integrations and if you keep these private you don't need to have them approved by the SE your team you can create these completely free of charge and hook them up with your own apis and use them directly within your own sapure account so instead of spending hours setting up complex automation for every new SAS you built create a custom integration once and make it reusable any new SAS you buil build and this works perfectly with your GitHub packages and custom boiler plates for a new SAS all you have to do is install an mpm package use a custom sap and you're ready of course once again this will take time to learn and to set up initially that's the whole point of a factory it's timec consuming once and fast in the future all right now that we got both code and no code covered the next thing we need is the [Music] can someone come and clean up this mess I'm sorry about that uh we need to go downstairs to the creative library but first let me tell you about eight base eight base is an AI powered all-in-one support solution for your SAS it's one of the SAS product that was built in this Factory for this Factory by me and my team you see all SAS bars need customer support and with eight base we have covered whole thing you start by adding an AI chat bot to your website and your app which will serve as live chat support and direct access to your FAQ and health dis articles which you can create directly from a base you then build a custom ticket form using our no code for Builder to capture important information and help users with issues that are a bit too hard for an AI to solve finally you create an email inbox so you can receive and manage support emails from 8base 2 everything from one unified dashboard and of course you use a base to train custom AI models on your data your websites PDFs YouTube videos and so on integrating it into your app takes seconds and once it's live our team of AI robots will help you handle customer support without you getting involved in every single step a base is a part of my sasf factory it should be a part of yours too that's why we're giving our subscriptions at 50% off for the entire higher first year use the code Factory 50 and start your subscription today the link is in the comment below now back to the factory this is our creative library in here we store reusable images and Graphics we use these for thumbnails ad creatives graphics for social media and much more getting stuck creatively is horrible so instead whenever we need something new we just go in here and pick up a template we even have video templates and essential graphics for video editing for instance if you want to publish a new video demo or create a new video ad we use these as building blocks to speed up editing in order to build this part of the factory I suggest using figma for images and Adobe After Effects for essential Graphics in figma you can use components to create template Graphics these can include different variants of elements so you can compose new pieces of Graphics easily Additionally you can build up a library of reusable graphic Parts like fonts scribbl characters icons and much more in Adobe After Effects you can turn animations and clips into essential graphics and make each layer customizable too this makes it easy to reuse different pre-made clips and graphics and adjust them in Adobe Premiere when you edit and I feel like I'm repeating myself a bit here but do spend some time making this nice and organized for yourself building a SAS Factory is all about making your future life easier and if you really don't want to spend time setting all this up you can always buy a readymade Simon did you forget what happened to your old factory oh well I just thought that please don't make that same mistake again it took us ages to rebuild this place remember you're right you're right okay there's something I need to tell you this is not my first SAS Factory a while back I was in a hurry to get my first SAS started and I found this SAS Factory that was for sale I called the seller and apparently it was my lucky day so I went down there to meet him and this SAS Factory has everything available inside it absolutely does sight you can start printing SAS products right away and have your first product ready to tomorrow how about that that's amazing I'll I'll take it perfect sign you'll be very happy with your new SAS Factory wow I can't believe this is mine now but I had no idea how to operate this Factory the manual was extremely poorly written and nothing really made sense to me I was trying a bunch of different things to get my first SAS product ready but nothing was working I spent a ton of money on this things so I was getting very frustrated at some point I pressed some button and something went wrong and the whole place caught fire a few moments later and the whole thing burned to the ground it was terrible all the money and time I had spent wasted but at that very moment when I was the most demoralized I made a decision I was going to build a new Factory from scratch I started planning how my factory would work in details I knew this was going to take a lot of hard work and effort but slowly piece by piece I got my new Factory working and this time because I build it from scratch I knew it inside and out it was not going to fail on me this time we still need two things in order to run a successful SAS Factory the first is a protocol keep a checklist and a setup up requirements all new sass products need this should include things such as a payment system email system user authentication but also things like privacy policy terms and conditions and so on I suggest using a tool like notion for this save all your legal documents as templates and keep checklists for all parts of your SAS development every time you set up a new SAS make sure you can cross everything on the list consider this quality control and as part of doing protocol and quality check make make sure all parts of your SAS Factory are well documented and all processes are well described don't let yourself end up in a situation where you get confused and don't remember what to do finally you need a Playbook A playbook is something that goes beyond the factory itself it's a guideline a framework that outlines your practices and strategies a rule set you follow and use to plan and execute each SAS most successful serial entrepreneurs do exactly this if you look at some of the most successful Founders you'll notice that they tend to play the same game again and again if you look at most successful Indie creators it's the same thing I do this too look at how I launch and Market my products if you've been following my journey you've probably noticed that I follow the same Playbook too and this is the perfect opportunity to announce that you can now buy my playbook and my entire SAS Factory but I'm obviously not going to do that cuz I'm not some snake o salesman if I sold you my playbook I would probably make a lot of money and even if my playbook works for me it's highly unlikely that it's going to work for you and using someone else's Factory and expecting the same results is most likely going to end in disaster what truly gives you superpowers is the process of building the factory all the hard-earned lessons that make up the foundation you're building on that's what really makes a difference and it's not something you can buy so get started building your own sass Factory today thanks for watching

TITLE: 5 A.I. SaaS Ideas To Launch In 2024
VIDEO ID: PFslOvkPXTI
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFslOvkPXTI
================================================================================

if you thought the AI hype was about to die out you'd be very wrong open AI released fine-tuning new AI models and apparently a c star algorithm that can do some extremely Wild Things mid journey is constantly improving YouTube now allows you to chat directly with the YouTube video Google rolled out some massive improvements to B and AI is still even after a year all around us all the time last year around this time I published a YouTube video with seven AI SAS ideas you can start in 2023 and in this video I'll follow up with another five ideas you can start in 2024 though worth keeping in mind that a whole lot of things changed in the last year which is why some of these ideas might appear a bit different perhaps even a bit controversial but stay with me here and let's get started the first idea is an AI based tool to help you improve your marketing site imagine a tool that would dissect your website not just mechanically but with an artistic and strategic eye this tool will do more than just the basic Tech technical audit it would narrow in on the essence of what makes a website resonate with its target audience imagine this tool scanning your website's copy it's not just looking for errors but analyzing the effectiveness of your words it will suggest changes to make your messaging more compelling and relatable to your audience the tool would also review your s's layout and images it would help you ensure they're not just attractive but strategically placed for Maximum Impact think of it as having an AI power designer suggesting layout tweaks and image adjustments that are proven to grab attention and guide visitors to take action I imagine a simple interface where you provide a link to your current website and give the tool a bit of insight into your market and your target audience then hit analyze and get a full report with actionable recommendations to refine and improve your site you could use a combination of GPT 4 Del and vision to analyze a website and generate a report we already have a lot of tools that will do a technical analysis of your website with SEO as the main objective I but I haven't found a tool like this that would strictly focus on the experiments of the human and the psychology of sales and conversions let's move on to idea number two this one is building on top of the first idea but taking a radical step further an AI driven AB testing tool hear me out here this isn't just about split testing AI generator suggestions it's about implementing them and scientifically testing their effectiveness here's how it would work once the tool has analyzed and generated suggestions for improvements the ab Tes would spring into action it would automatically update your website and apply the changes and then it would set up a split test this means that your website would simultaneously present the original version and the modified version to different segments of your audience the beauty of this tool lies in its autonomous and continuous learning it would meticulously analyze user interactions on both versions of your site if the new changes lead to better engagement or higher conversions the tool would automatically Implement them across the board but it doesn't stop there it's a cycle of Perpetual improvements after deploying successful changes the tool would start the process all over again constantly searching for new areas to optimize and test it's like having a tireless AI marketer continuously experimenting and refining your website to Peak Performance this tool could use Technologies like Del or mid journey to produce new images and graphics and GPT 4 to produce new copy and at the same time work just like a no code website builder that's able to build and deploy a static website given a set of instructions and API calls of course the level of automation could be configurable you might want to generate a preview link of each new version and then have the user approve before starting a new split test though I really think this would be an awesome tool if you're already building or considering building a no code website builder maybe you should look into adding this part to stand out oh and this video is sponsored by eight base an AI powered support ecosystem built to give your users an outstanding customer experience on autopilot it's a new AI sayas my team and I recently launched and if you're running a small business and struggling to keep up with customer support you should pay attention now having live chat on your website or in your app is tricky cuz once it's there users tend to use it and the problem is if you're not responding within 30 to 60 second or at least within 5 minutes it's such a poor experience for the user that you're better off removing the live chat alt together eight base is here to solve that you can create a chat about in minutes and start training it on your own data right away add your landing page your blog posts medium articles or any other public website add any public YouTube videos upload documents such as PDF and of course create a custom knowledge base as an FAQ using 8 Bas Rich editor then add the chat bot to your website or app and have it answer all your users questions we offer a completely free plan to get you started and you can even bring your own open AI key to bypass some of the limitations of the free plan I've put a link in the description below check it out and get started with eight Bas today all right the next idea in our AI say lineup is a smart efficient solution to task that I think pretty much everyone hates booking we need an AI based accounting plugin this isn't another piece of accounting software it's a Plugin or a Chrome extension that integrates with your existing accounting tools and adds the power of AI picture this the plugin scans your invoices receipts and financial statements and using AI it categorizes and organizes the data in a way that aligns with accounting best practices now I'm currently using tools like aim. which is fantastic for automating web-based tasks but imagine something more specialized tailored specifically for accounting you would probably imagine these features being added to some of the existing accounting software in the near future but honestly for some reason these types of software tends to be slow at innovating and touching new tech so I actually don't think we're going to have something like that in most accounting software in any foreseeable future and I think a Chrome extension for this would be a super helpful micro SAS I'd buy it which brings me to the next idea an AI based file manager imagine this you select an entire desktop or a Google drive or a Dropbox or similar and you drop the whole thing into this tool and it will go through all folders all subfolders and all files look at the file names the dates the type of file the name of the folders and so on and so on and organize it in the most intuitive way can it will tidy up years of accumulated mess on your computer in a few seconds now I'm actually quite organized so I go through this painful process manually fairly often and yet I still end up with a hard drive mess really fast and I know some people who barely get work done because of this I imagine tool with a simple drag and drop interface or if it's a Google drive it could be a Chrome extension it should be able to organize based on best judgment but it should also optionally take a few instructions in case you have specific preferences now imagine bringing this to your notion dashboard your emails or other places where things tend to get out of hand I think this would be a super nice solution to a small but frequent and rather painful problem okay this last idea is a bit more Technical and Niche but hear me out a fine-tuning studio for synthetic data you've probably already heard all the talk about open Ai and qar one of the things it was speculated to do well was creating synthetic training data for the next generation of AI models in fact Microsoft already published research on this and I don't think there's any doubt this is going to be the future of AI one AI generating synthetic data to train the next Ai and as it turns out the same principle is already super useful when you're fine-tuning the existing models from open AI the idea itself is pretty straightforward you manually craft some data or pull it from the resources you have access to and then you use AI to generate new data with similar properties and similar patterns now you use that data to fine-tune a new AI model we did this while training the AI chat assistant for feed hve and creating the fine-tuned models for eight base and it works surprisingly well the only problem is that the process of generating it can be rather tedious and require a lot of scripting back and forth to align the format of data and the right type so here's the idea create assess that helps you prefabricate small samples of training data in a desired format allow the user to configure how varied the data should be how much it should be allowed to deviate and how outliers in the data set should look like and so on and then use gp4 to expand the data set based on the sample data and the requirements perhaps include features like anomaly detection validation and other use use ful tools open AI recently created a nice UI for fineing their model so of course be aware that something like this might be added by open AI itself however given how long it took them to add that simple UI we have now I don't think this is where their focus is at so in my opinion there's an obvious opportunity here and I would definitely subscribe to a tool like this now once you've created and launched any of these SAS ideas the real challeng is begin you need to get users on board and this is surprisingly hard which is why have created the perfect road mapap to get the first 100 users the first thousand users and Beyond I would highly recommend watching that one next remember to check out eight base and if you got value from this video remember to give it a like And subscribe to my channel

================================================================================

the support emails were pouring in way faster than I could possibly manage to keep up and it just didn't seem to stop I desperately needed to come up with a solution fast let's start from the beginning Twitter had just introduced their new API prices and we had sent out an announcement explaining that our products would discontinue the integration within a few hours our live chats were on fire and not in a good way we had a lot of angry users and a lot of understanding users but with a ton of questions at this time I had three people on chat support trying their best to keep up with the constant flow of new messages it was excruciating 3 weeks in and the first of my support agents resigned it was just too much then the second one resigned within another week or so so it was just me and one other support agent now and the messages just kept pouring in I tried my best to create articles that would explain some of the questions that kept recurring but it didn't help see as long as there's a live chat icon on your website users will use it and if they have to wait more than 5 minutes for a reply it's a bad experience and there was no way we could keep a response time that low my last support guy kept going like a soldier but it was pointless and the onear ratings kept coming in one after the other this just wasn't fair so I took the hard decision and I let him go at this point I was desperate that ding sound from our chat software was starting to give me trauma I could literally hear it in my sleep little did I know that what was about to happen was going to be far more agonizing I was desperate so I did the thing I removed the live chat from our app and website then it got quiet like dead quiet it was almost unsettling for a moment though this felt fantastic like a ton of weight was taken off my shoulders but obviously I knew that the problem didn't go away from just removing live chat and looking at my strip dasboard the next day confirmed my fear users were turning faster than I had ever seen before and now support emails were pouring in way faster that I could possibly manage to keep up I desperately needed to come up with a solution should I hire new support staff how long would it take to unboard them would this just create more problems and more overhead I was paralyzed it was truly one of these moments where I just closed my eyes and wished that the problem would magically go away but then I got an idea one of our features is a chat bot that helps write content for social media like chat GPT but specifically trained for Content what if I turned this chat bot into an AI support assistant if I could train it to know everything about my business it could answer users questions and help them with their problems around the clock it wouldn't need breaks it wouldn't need sleep it would always become C under pressure and it wouldn't even ask for pay hey I got to work and I spent the next 2 weeks grinding trying to solve this problem once and for all I realized that there would still be situations where users needed to get in contact with our team so I built a ticketing system directly into notion which we were already using for project management I added the chatbot the ticketing system and I pushed to production and the results were absolutely mind-blowing churn went down Revenue stabilized customer satisfaction went up users were happy at least in most cases we were still receiving tickets and emails but the need for human support was reduced by almost 90% compared to before absolutely mind-blowing and at this point I was not in doubt I had to turn this into a sass I am so excited to present a base an AI powered support ecosystem built to give your users and outstanding customer experience on autopilot you can create a chatbot in minutes and start training it on your own data right away add your landing page your blog posts medium articles or any other public website add any public YouTube videos upload documents such as PDF and create a custom knowledge based as an FAQ using a Bas Rich editor then add the chat bot to your website or app and have it answer all your users questions of course from the a based dashboard you can monitor all convers ation your users are having and uncover knowledge gaps in the replies your chatbot is giving if you notice it's answering incorrectly it's easy to exclude a specific piece of knowledge and by using the FAQ you can always create a new answer that better addresses the exact question this is perfect for customer support but it also works really well if you're a Creator or public person and you want an AI version of yourself that your audience can interact with in fact I have an AI version of myself on my website ready to answer Christians about SAS I mentioned before that we build a ticketing system into notion it worked well but it was very homemade and quite hard to use so instead we recreated the perfect AI power ticketing system in a base you can create a custom ticket form using our no code form Builder and easily embedded into your app this allows your users to create tickets which will appear in your 8base dashboard from here you can communicate with the user handle their issues and make sure they get a smooth experience the AI behind this ticket system uses your training data too but it also learns from every ticket you resolve and uses this to make Smart Suggestions when a new ticket comes in this will help you and your tech support team resolve issues 10 times faster with eight base you can stop spending unnecessary time on customer support or you're a developer that's awesome cuz we have made everything highly customizable and developer friendly you can take full control over the 8base elements and integrate them into into your app in countless different ways everything is built using web components so it doesn't care which UI framework you're using and it doesn't pollute your site with heavy eye frames you can set up web hooks to notify other parts of your system when tickets are updated new comments are created and much more and if you're not a developer don't worry cuz you can set up all chat Bots and ticket forms in a no code fashion too and we offer a hosted ticket page where your users can access all their Open tickets we're already working on in creations with a lot of third party tools and we're going to have email support announcements feature requests and a public API for teams that really want full control and here's the deal this tool has already been so valuable to us that I really just want to share it with you which is why you can get started with a base completely for free we have a free plan no trial you don't need to add a credit card you can literally just sign up and start using it but you probably know that offering this kind of AI tool at scale isn't exactly cheap so on a free plan you will be limited to 50 messages per month however if you bring your own API key from open AI we're going to remove this limit entirely you can use eight base for free with unlimited messages if you bring your own API key check the link in the description below and sign up for an a Bas account today are you still here thank you for listening to my story if you're a s founder with any level of Commercial Success big or small all I'm sure you've had a similar experience with customer support if you're using crisp chat or inom on your website right now and you're struggling to keep up with replies here's the best advice I can give you remove it studies show that having a live chat and not being able to deliver response within 5 minutes is a worse custom experience than not having a live chat at all so remove it and give eight base a try instead let me know what you think of our new project in the comments below I will see you soon for another video

this product makes almost a million dollar a year and it's completely bootstrapped this product makes almost a million dollar a month and it's only 2 years old and this product and this product and this product and this product they're all killing it but what do they have in common are they just all Superior Products they are great products but the reason they're exceptional is because they figured out how to blow up their user base and how to keep up momentum and growth continuously month after month this is not just luck this is science and fortunately if we break down what these startups do well we can reproduce it and Achieve explosive results too in this video I will give you a road map containing three simple but Mighty strategies for getting more users at every stage of your SAS Journey we'll take a look at how to get the first 100 users and how to get the next 500 to 1,000 users and finally we'll discover how successful SAS platforms use these strategies to blow up and continue to grow their user base to New Heights OH okay okay but let's just come back down to earth how about we start by getting the first five and probably most important users on board in order to get there we need to get a basic understanding of what it actually means to acquire a user a user acquisition simply means the act of gaining a new user for an app a platform or an online service every user acquisition has the following a method a channel and the cost and depending on the type of Acquisitions we're going for we need to plan these out and as you can imagine combining different forms of these three elements turns into a whole lot of different ways we can acquire a user ranging from completely free Acquisitions to paying a whole lot just to get one new user and ways that require a ton of work and doesn't scale and other ways that scale almost automatically without any additional effort and this is exactly why we need a road map tailored to the different stages of your SAS Journey cuz some of these methods work really well in the very beginning and others are excellent for putting your s g into growth mode or even automation mode where users just keep coming in but before we can get users we need to use these elements to design a user acquisition model and while these two elements are highly variable at least we can put the method into four different types let's have a look essentially all the different online marketing channels you can imagine fall into either one of these four methods incoming this means that the user reaches out to you they become aware of your product and they serve them El to sign up or makes a request to your team to get in contact with them so they can get on board outgoing this means that you reach out to the user the initial contact is on your side you initiate the conversation you make a sale and you convert them into a paid user referrals this happens when your current users will bring in new users who will in turn bring in more new users advertising this one is similar to the incoming method but what's specific with advertisement is that you pay to get in front of the user and make them aware of your product that way all right let's get busy we need to design two acquisition models that we want to use for the first stage of our road map we want to get our first five early users on board followed by getting the first 100 real users for the first five users we're going to design a model that looks something like this for the method we're going to use outgoing which means that we will reach out to the first batch of users and hopefully get five of them on board the channel we'll be using is email or DMS on whatever message app you're using and the cost is $0 since we're going to do this ourselves manually one by one the idea here is pretty simple you're going to use your close Network family friends colleagues Partners people you know personally who you believe would benefit from your product you will tell them that you're launching a product and that you have an MVP ready and that you're looking for the first few users to get on board you will offer them a completely free account for live and all you will ask for in return is their feedback of of course not all users will naturally be a good fit but if your product solves an actual problem for some of these early users it should definitely be possible to get five of them on board once you have these first five users in place make sure to include them all in a small community either a Discord group a Facebook group a WhatsApp group or whatever works for you before going on to the next step you want to spend a bit of time with this handful of new users listen to their feedback fix bugs Implement some features according to their wishes and smoothing out some of the rough edges make sure to serve these users well let them have a big say in how the platform should work and which direction you should take remember how I said that these users are the most important ones it'll be clear why in a moment cuz what we're trying to do here is to make these users more than just users we're turning them into Advocates and this is crucial for the next acquisition model we're going to design this model will take us from five up to 100 users for the method we're going to use referrals and the channel we're going to be using is referral links that are current early users can use the cost of this model depends you could offer your first users a cut of the revenue for every new users they refer but in most cases I actually don't think this is necessary if you truly did a great job of serving your first five early adopters really well and really make them feel like they're part of this project chances are they'll be happy to help refer new users without getting paid so I would Design This model with zero cost but instead offer the new users a big discount for joining early and for making both your Advocates and the new users feel a bit special for being part of something up and cominging this also greatly helps your Advocates bring in new users since they now have a really good offer on their hand most early users would love to help all right time to get serious we're now entering stage two of the road map at this stage we want to acquire 500 to 1,000 new users none of our current acquisition model will work for this it would be very hard to do zeroc cost Cod emails and DMS at this scale to realistically get 500 to to 1,000 users on board we also can expect to keep incentivizing new users to yet again refer new users at this scale we need a completely new model for this let's design it for the method we're going to use incoming which means that we will have users reach out to us or to sign up themselves by going to a website in order for this to work at scale we need to create awareness and I know and probably you know that what I'm about to say is going to make me sound like a completely broken record cuz I've said this in so many of my videos already the best way to create an acquisition model using the incoming method is by creating content and building in public the channels we're going to use are social media and search engines create long form video content to show up on YouTube search create blog post to show up on Google create Tik toks reals and YouTube shorts to catch people's attentions on the flight share updates on LinkedIn your highs and lows new discoveries new Milestones share your lessons on Hacker News and Indie hackers and most importantly keep doing it this stage is long and hard you're not going to see results very fast but you need to keep going this also means that this acquisition model is going to come with cost you must expect to invest in good content and how much you're willing to pay for an acquisition entirely depends on the RPO or average revenue per user your SAS is generating there's going to be long stretches where your content won't get much engagement let alone result in conversions so you need to closely Monitor and optimize on this part but I guarantee you this acquisition model works it just takes time so keep going let the revenue from existing users pay for acquiring new users until you hit at least 500 users this way and finally we're ready for the last stage at stage three we're going to take our user base from a th users and aim at continuously growing it this doesn't mean that stage two is now over you should definitely keep the incoming acquisition model going and you should keep creating content stage three is a bit special because there are multiple directions you can take you can aim to grow your SS as fast and big as you can which requires reinvesting every dime into the next acquisition model we're going to look at or you can choose to start taking some profit for your hard work and instead aim to automate Acquisitions and have new users come in on autopilot in both cases there are two acquisition models that are perfectly suited for this stage let's design them in the first one we're going to use the advertisement method this means that we're going to take some of all the content that has proven to work well during stage two and turn them into paid ads that we can scale and use to reach a whole new level of awareness of course this also includes crafting testing and scaling new ad creatives and trying out new strategies for the channels I recommend Google ads for search ads and video ads on YouTube MAA for image ads and video ads on Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok for video ads on Tik Tok again the cost of this acquisition model depends on the average revenue per user your s is generating and how big of a return on ad spend you wish if you're in growth mode you might not care much about a return at all and instead just max out the revenue to pay for new acquisitions if you want to build up a profit you might aim for a 3:1 return on ad spend which means that for each $1 you spend on acquiring a new user that new user earns your SAS $3 then you put one of those dollars into acquiring yet a new user and you keep $1 as a profit in the second acquisition model we're once again going to use the referal method but this time we're not just going to ask a handful of users to refer new users we're going to offer an affiliate program where new users can sign up create referral links and start spreading the word in order for it to work at this scale you definitely need to offer your affiliate Partners a proper compensation I've seen some affiliate programs offer 10 20 even a 50% share of all recurring Revenue that new referrals generate and once again how much you're willing to offer your affiliate Partners entirely depends on your direction if you're in growth mode you might want to share a big chunk of Revenue to keep everyone highly motivated and if you're in automation mode you can go as low as gift cards or unlocking new features or increasing usage limitations for your affiliate partners and obviously this road map can take many forms you can start by running ads from the very early stages and you can scale cold Outreach in the later stages too so this particular road map isn't the only one but it is the one that I have used to build and scale three products and it is the one that I would use again for my next SS now this whole video obviously assumes that you already have a product if you need to take a step even further back I highly recommend watching this video next if you got value from this video please give it a like and consider subscribing to my channel for more content like this I will see you soon for another video

TITLE: 5 Ways to Create a No Code Side Hustle
VIDEO ID: wx5PmLbM5wo
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx5PmLbM5wo
================================================================================

no code is one of the best things that happened to check entrepreneurship and the most obvious takeaway is pretty clear we can build launch and even scale products without having to code but what if you're not quite there yet what if you just want a simple side hustle going just using no code is that possible too let's tap into this incredibly popular movement and community and explore the options I'll show you five ways you can create a side hustle in the no code space the first and probably the most obvious method is creating and selling templates if you're great with the signs and no web development you can apply to become a webflow Template Designer webflow templates are sold through webflow's own Marketplace and typically silver somewhere between fifty dollars and hundred and fifty dollars and you get to keep 80 of that sale yourself this is actually quite good especially since this is passive in the sense that you only have to create a template once and then sell as many times as you can if you can sell just two to three of these per day at an average price of 75 you got yourself a five thousand dollar per month income stream after webflows cut not bad at all worth pointing out that webflow does have requirements and standards you need to meet in order to start selling but if you already have the skills as a web developer and designer this one should be pretty straightforward another way is by selling notion templates you might already have heard some huge success stories like a slow and Thomas Frank who are making a lot of money selling notion templates but even if you don't want to enter to that level you can still make a decent income by setting up Advanced templates for project management data capturing organization finances and much more in notion and selling the template from your website this one doesn't require you to apply anywhere but you do need to cover marketing yourself if we take a look at aslo and Thomas Frank you'll notice that they have huge audiences and that they're very active on social media in the same way you'll need to establish yourself as an authority and educate people on the specific philosophies and ideas behind your templates setting up something in notion is only part of the equation most of the templates that sell really well are built on top of well-known models and Frameworks and whatever your template is trying to help solve which brings us to Method number two creating content around no code no code is more than just a collection of tools it's a movement it's all about empowering and democratizing Tech entrepreneurship for non-technical Founders and creators and there are huge communities built around this not to mention the many many new local tools that constantly enter the market the demand is massive and this makes the market extremely attractive for new sales to enter so there's an obvious opportunity here create a YouTube channel or podcast centered around this no code movement I made my first no code related video last year when my channel had around 10 000 subscribers and I immediately started getting a lot of offers from no code SAS companies who wanted to sponsor my next video I was charging between fifteen hundred dollars and three thousand dollars for a single sponsored mid-roll and this was despite the fact that my channel was quite small at the time and at the same time I started seeing a huge spike in the RPM of my channel reaching as high as 14 to 16 okay quick breakdown if you don't know what RPM is when YouTube who puts ads on your videos they share 55 of the revenue that advertisers are paying with you the Creator RPM stands for Revenue per mil and shows how much you earn per thousand views on your video but all ads aren't equal when multiple advertisers want to put an ad on YouTube an auction is taking place and some topics related to some markets are simply much more competitive which forces the advertisers into a bidding war which in turn brings up the price for showing that particular ad and in some very competitive niches advertisers are bidding much more aggressively and this shows directly on your RPM this is why some channels make a lot of money from ad Revenue while other channels make close to nothing even though they get the same number of views and same number of ads shown on their videos and as it turns out no code is one of these markets where Advertiser demand drives up the prices on both ads and sponsor deals so creating content in the no code space especially on YouTube can become a legitimate income stream and as you saw with my YouTube channel you don't even have to wait that long before offers start to come in okay this next one is a bit more specific but I believe there's a great demand for this you could create a no-code Consulting business that teaches employee to become citizen developers so here's the situation there are a lot of companies out there that are not tech companies per se it could be law firms accounting companies retail chains Healthcare Providers and so on they're not tech companies but they increasingly rely on technological solutions to handle internal operations automation managing data flows and a lot of other things but for these companies hiring an actual software developer is very expensive and probably a bit overkilled so the solution many of them turn to is to find their most technical employee and turn that one into a cities developer and a citizen developer is a technical person who doesn't actually program instead they use no code and local tools to build internal applications and workflows but without needing the full skill sets of an actual software engineer you could create a Consulting business where you offer to train a company's most technically capable employees and turn them into citizen developers you would be coaching them in the use of no code tools low code tools and if you have a formal training and software development you could teach them lightweight software engineering Concepts as a part of their training enough for them to bridge the gap between the requirements of the company they work for and the many capabilities it and Tech has to offer so if you're into consulting or building an agency I think there's huge untapped potential right here okay now that we're already down the agency Street let's take a look at the next one a no code MVP agency let's unpack this one if you've been in the startup ecosystem you probably know that there's this term that's tossed around a lot the MVP and minimum viable product it's the most basic version of a product that allows Founders to quickly test the market gather feedback yes secure funding and get investors on board if that's the path you choose the problem traditional MEP development actually often requires a fair bit of time and money it typically also requires someone on board who can program which can be quite a show stopper for Founders without engineering experience building an MVP this way is actually fairly risky business and that's typically what Founders want to avoid at this stage a common solution is to use prototypes which are basically just sophisticated slideshows to demonstrate how a potential product could look but there's obviously a perfect in between and no code MVP some Founders take off this challenge themselves but there are founding teams who would rather spend time on strategy planning and marketing and then hire a team of software Engineers once they have initial Market validation and secured funding and that's where you come in you run an agency that specializes in developing MVPs using no code use it out to understand the Founder's vision and truly get to the heart of what they're trying to achieve and to translate that into a tangible market-ready early stage solution it's part consultancy part Tech development a hybrid model that caters to the demand of the non-tech startup world I definitely believe there's great potential in a service business like this and finally method number five is building a micro sets using no code this one is where the power of no code truly shines for those unfamiliar microsass is essentially a small software service that addresses a niche requirement or solves a very specific problem it's not about serving everyone and it's not a SAS that's meant to scale but rather it's about serving a very specific small audience incredibly well now under normal circumstances developing a SAS requires a significant investment in both time and often also capital and you typically need to have someone on the founding team with a software engineering background but no code platforms have changed the game with plan platforms like bubble wized webflow flutter flow sapier member stack air table paply and many others you can actually build fully functional apps without riding a single line of code I have a bunch of videos on this channel which I will link to below that will get you started building fully functional software using these tools there are founders who built no code says that's literally turning over millions per year of course those are the big success stories but it's possible and even better if you can capture a small Niche audience and solve a small but repetitive problem using no code you can realistically create a SAS that generates five thousand to ten thousand dollars a month which I believe is a very decent signing up so five ways you can create a side income in the no code space do you know any others please share with us in the comments let's all help each other out if you got intrigued about the last one I put together a playlist specifically for no code SAS development so I would highly recommend to check that one out right now if you enjoyed this video please give it a like And subscribe to my channel for more content like this I will see you soon for another video

TITLE: Sneaky Way to Use Google Ads in Your SaaS (Copy This Strategy)
VIDEO ID: I9BXhcjxEsw
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9BXhcjxEsw
================================================================================

I'm pretty sure you've seen this before you search on Google trying to find that tool and boom up comes three to four other similar tools on top of the results you were looking for and yes they're at trying to steal their competitors users this is the dirty game of advertisement and if you're building a SAS most likely this will happen to you as well very soon the question is is there a way to protect yourself from this or should you just get dirty with everyone else and start running competitor ads too without going too deep into the moral and ethical discussion of this the short answer is yes you 100 should for two reasons obviously to drive conversions but there's another one you can actually use this to spy on how well your competitors are doing I'll get back to that in a moment in this video I'll show you how to protect yourself against competitor ads I'll show you an insanely easy way to set up your own competitor ads and I'll show you a sneaky takeaway that I haven't heard anyone mention before let's get started so first of all can you protect yourself from your competitors running these kinds of ads targeting your brand name the short answer is practically no according to Google's policies you cannot use your competitors trademark in your ad copy if you find a violation of this you can file a report to Google and they'll take your competitors ads down but that means you need to submit a trademark registration on your Brand's name which costs around 500 just in the US and you'll have to do this in all countries where you want your brand name to be protected some Services handle this internationally but it easily cost five thousand dollars or more and they still don't cover all countries in the world and even if you do all this your competitors can still run ads on your Brand's name they're allowed to use it as a keyword they just can't use your name in the ad copy itself so practically you can't really protect yourself against this however there is a way you can soften the blow a little I'll show you in a second so let's just join the Dark Side and start running our own competitor ads Fight Fire with Fire and make some money while we're doing it this next part will blow your mind because there's a hecky way we can effectively Target at all our competitors with one campaign one asset and one single ad it's easy to set up and super easy to manage let's do it go to ads.google.com and create a new account if you don't have one already go to goals conversions and set up a new conversion action you'll need to install a Google tag on your website and you need to decide what a conversion should be typically this is a user signing up for your SAS once your conversion goal is set up we can create a new campaign for the campaign objective you can select either leads or sales it doesn't really matter now add the sign up conversion goal you just created before the campaign type we'll pick search and we'll add our website here and pay the name and we can move on we want to focus on conversions and we can skip the target CPA for now we'll exclude the Display Network we will keep the default settings for everything else all right this is where it gets fun here we're going to add a list of all our competitors names we're going to wrap them in square brackets there are three different ways Google can match a keyword if you just type the word or sentence Google will use broad match that means that Google will match the keyboard or any other keyword that somehow relates to it I personally never use this it's quite a black box and your ads might end up showing in all kinds of crazy places for a campaign like this we certainly don't want to use this if we wrap the word or sentence in quotes Google will use phrase match this means that Google will show your ad on Search terms that include your keyword much better but for this specific campaign it's still not good enough we want to get very specific with the search term where our ads will show and it'll be clear why in a moment finally if we wrap the word or sentence in square brackets Google will use exact match that means that Google will Target the exact keyword or sentence that's used or keywords that have a very similar meaning that's exactly what we want so let's go ahead and add a long list of competitors and square brackets in my case I'm advertising one of my SAS products feed Hive which is a social media management tool so I'll fill in a lot of competitors in this market both big and small finally let's create our ad now a bit of human psychology kicks in here so we want to use a very specific phrasing [Music] in the first position we're gonna write disappointed with hit the curly bracket and choose keyboard insertion pick title case and add a default text here what will happen is that Google will substitute this part with the keyword that was just entered so in my case if people search for agrippulse they'll see my ad saying disappointed with egg ripples if they search for HootSuite it'll say disappointed with HootSuite if Google for some reason can't match a keyword it'll just default to disappointed with social so of course make sure to pick a default word that makes sense in your case Google will try to shuffle these headlines so to make sure this one always comes up first we just click this little pin button here and say show only in position one let's add a few more headlines that Google can try only one of these will be shown together with the first one at a time but Google will try them all and see what works best awesome now let's add a few descriptions here you're simply going to sell your service I suggest using some of the copy from your website and again Google will try these in combination with the headlines and move forward with the one that works best all of these are optional but I suggest adding at least a business name and a logo finally set up budget for this campaign I'll run this for a hundred dollars a day but you can put any budget that you're comfortable with here publish the campaign and wait for it to go live now we are using our competitors names directly in the ad copy so if they're trademarked Google might reject some of these keywords that's totally fair it's nothing to worry about that just won't show okay but let's be honest here you're now playing a dirty game your competitors are very likely to notice this and most likely they'll start running ads on your brand name as well and as we discovered before there's no way you can protect yourself against this but you can of course do the obvious which is simply running ads on your own brand name to at least give your competitors some competition when targeting your brand name as a keyboard this is what everyone else is doing and I highly recommend that you do this as well set up another campaign with a single exact matte keyword which is your brand name and run an ad for yourself and is it kind of stupid that we all have to run ads on our own brand name to protect ourselves from competitors ads well it's not a perfect world but I do want to show you a huge bonus that comes from running exactly this kind of ads because there's a secret side effect to this that allow us to get a sneak peek on how well our competitors are actually doing the secret ingredients is the phrasing of the ad disappointed with question mark If a person searches for a tool and they click on a link that says disappointed with that tool that means they're most likely disappointed with that too and Google will tell on them because we can see exactly which of these keywords are delivering the highest click-through rate and the highest conversion rate in my case I have two competitors that are standing out from the rest High Fury and ukoya are taking the lead here while the click-through rate and conversion rate are very high on these tools which means that when people search for these names many of them are likely to click a link that says disappointed with hype Fury or disappointed with okoya and many of them are inclined to actually sign up for feed Hive instead and in the other end of the spectrum we can see that the tools popular and agripauls got a fair amount of Impressions which means many people saw this ad but very few chose to click it it would be fair to interpret that people are very happy with Poplar and Agro pulse and that the sentence disappointed with agribles doesn't seem to resonate very well and this is incredible insight for me as a competitor I should study Hyperion okoya and treat them as good examples of what not to do since people seem disappointed with these tools and at the same time I should study popular and agricults as good examples of what to do right since they seem to have captured a very loyal user base and of course when I have the inside I need I might very well turn off the ad for those low performing competitor names and give more space to show my ads on the tools that are likely to drive conversions we had more than 100 new users sign up for feed Hive just this week from the top 5 competitors on this list I know I'm bringing the actual names of some of my competitors here and I'm not doing this to throw mud this is data and it's something everyone can get so okay hi Fury if you're watching this sorry but not really sorry this is the name of the game and popular I actually see the founder around in various groups on Facebook you're an annoying dude you seem to have done very well here kudos for that I'll be studying you finally it's worth saying that this is just one slice of reality we see here just because I drive a lot of clicks on some keywords and few on others in a setup like this doesn't necessarily mean that they're doing either good or bad obviously there are many factors at play here nothing about this is conclusive but this is a great way to get an impression and of course Drive conversions at the same time I hope

TITLE: 5 SaaS Ideas You Can Build as a Solo Founder
VIDEO ID: matM2KlG74Y
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=matM2KlG74Y
================================================================================

so you want to create a SAS and all you need is a great idea obviously you also need a sales team a customer support team marketing team operations and Business Development security and legal and wait a minute what if I don't want to manage any of this can you still build a SAS just you absolutely these people are called Indie creators and they build so-called micro SAS they do everything themselves and their team consists of one single person the founder itself in this video I'll give you five SAS ideas that you can build as a solo founder including examples from The Real World and we're going to discuss the pros and cons of building this way some of these might not be what you expected let's go the first idea building a tool on top of chat DPT AI is all over the place right now it's the most trending topic of 2023 and it's an obvious opportunity to build a small tool that extends the functionality of chat DBT itself check this out Gatsby has created a version of chat DBT that features a much nicer UI the ability to organize your chats and projects and folders in a library of AI characters ready to use they also have a Chrome extension and a lot of other things super cool a tool similar to this is typing mind which also features a whole lot of extensions to the regular chat DBT interface and here's the interesting part both of these tools require you to bring your own API key from open AI so they're not paying for the AI usage they simply offer a much more convenient and feature-rich interface for their users and I know what you're thinking why would people pay for this if they still have to pay for their own AI usage through open AI well as it turns out people are happy to both Gatsby and typingmind still as lifetime deals and Tony the creative typing mine already made tens of thousands of dollars on this tool and it's literally only a few months old when you pay openai per token through their API it's actually quite cheap so unless you're using AI a lot probably you won't ever spend 20 dollars per month which is the current price of chat EBT plus so for most users there's actually money to be saved here and you get a much more feed to Rich interface so there's your idea bring your own chat gpt-like interface to Market and give it your specific twist and this idea is no code friendly you can totally build an interface like this in a no-code tool like webflow framer or bubble and then consume chat gpt's API directly from the client I think there's still plenty of room in this market and a lot of money to be made so I just got rid of my entire team no people on a payroll no leading and managing anyone I have close to zero responsibilities now and my startup is way less risky for me to run but when I gave up one type of risk I'm now dealing with something else these guys of course I'm referring to platform risk the most realistic way to get a product to Market as a solo founder is to build on top of existing tools and Technologies but we have to face it the trade-off of building these kinds of products is that we're gonna be dependent on other platforms that comes with with risk when rear building on top of chat DBT there's a legitimate chance that openai will roll a similar feature themselves which might render your servers useless in fact in one of my previous videos I'm showing you how to validate a SAS idea and the idea used in this video was an AI prompt designer and there you go this is now a plugin directly available from chat DBT the good news is that if that happens we're just gonna build something new we're one-man team it's much easier to just go with the flow sorry guys you're not coming back alright here's idea number two building a SAS on top of notion notion is an incredible tool users all around the world love using it for note-taking sharing information project management and everything in between in fact notion has become so popular that people started building third-party tools on top of notion and some of them really add a tremendous amount of value on top of an already amazing tool you can use notion forms to create forms in notion you can use Q to schedule tweets from notion you can use feather to publish blog posts from the ocean you can use symbol to create entire websites in notion all of these tools are thriving profitable SAS tools and they're built by Indie creators consisting of one or two person teams there are a ton of opportunities here in fact there's one specific use case I want to share with you my team and I recently moved to notion and we're now using it for almost everything internal weekend documentation change logs issue tickets for our support team project management task for our development team asset library and thumbnail starters for this YouTube channel our content team even use it to plan and write our blog posts directly from notion but there was one thing that turned out to be disappointingly unsupported by notion itself automation which for us resulted in this a lot of cloud functions with custom code that uses Notions API to do Automation and I actually know quite a lot of other teams who end up with this huge spaghetti of sapier and make in order to turn notion into something highly operational so here's the opportunity create an automation Hub specifically for notion design it to look and feel similar to sapier or make and offer a lot of ready-made integration plugins that can be composed to create custom automation workflows for notion I've been looking for this tool myself heck I even considered building it needless to say I would subscribe to this SAS in a second if you consider building this please let me know in the comments I would be happy to join as an early adopter of course building notion tools comes with exactly the same level of risks as we discussed before recently notion added both Ai and their new projects so perhaps you can expect them to also add automation who knows some of us were expecting this already a year ago and nothing really happened so far I think building a tool that hooks up the notion with various other tools is a great micro SAS opportunity now let me just take a second to present the sponsor of this video feedive v-type is an ai-powered social media management tool built by us this is one of the SAS products my team and I run with feed Hive you can do so much more than just schedule your posts we have an integrated AI assistant that will help you write content for social media [Music] built on top of chat DBT but this one is specialized in creating content for social media and it has access to a lot of Insider knowledge that our company has gathered in the past years so not only will it help you write content but it will also give you a performance prediction that indicates how well your post will do and it uses AI to come up with suggestions that will make your post much more likely to go viral we're using open ai's incredibly powerful models for this but we have fine-tuned these models on millions of our own data points so its ability to predict performance is really good I used feed Hive to prepare posts for LinkedIn recently and with a bit of guidance I got this post to a prediction score of 89 and this post completely blew up of course V Dives AI is not a guaranteed win every time but for most people who aren't professional copywriters it's really helpful in getting the delivery just right check out the description below I've included the promo code that will give you 25 off for the entire first year of using feed Hive okay let's take a look at an idea that doesn't require you to build anything on top of an existing tool the catch is it's quite technical so the competitive Advantage is that you're offering to solve a technical issue that's rather complex so this one is for the more experienced software developers an SSL certificate manager let me just give you a quick backstory we're currently building link drip and no code link engagement tool as a part of this tool a user can add their own custom domains to use as a proxy for the links you create with link drip and this part was painful to deal with even I as an experienced software engineer was struggling to get this working smoothly fortunately I'm in a closed Discord group with some really smart people one of them is Oliver jumpers who's a content creator in the tech space and a very experienced software engineer he helped me get this service up and running and I was begging him to make this into a sass but since he didn't want to jump on this one I'm now bringing it to you a service that can handle custom domains and SSL certificates allowing other SAS tools to offer white label and multi-tenant features without having to deal with the technicalities it's pretty Niche but I really think there's a need here and if you're a really hardcore server engineer I don't see why you wouldn't be able to run a service like this as a solo founder so in no way is this one no code friendly but I think there's a great opportunity and I for one would subscribe in a second now let's move on to something less Technical and more oriented about learning here's the idea an Interactive Learning platform for a specific Niche there are already a lot of platforms out there that offer courses some of them have quizzes and some have assignments that you can download though countless Studies have shown that we learn much more effectively by performing an action rather than simply reading or hearing someone explain something so this idea is to use technology to provide learning material in a highly interactive and gamified way for a specific field of work a great example of this is I code this by Florin pop if you want to learn web development you can sign up for I code this and you will get a daily coding challenge that you need to solve you solve the challenge directly inside the tool itself and once you're done you can see how other people sold their challenge you can feature this work on your own profile such as LinkedIn and if you upgrade you get access to learning paths and mentoring by Professionals in a closed Discord group I think there's a ton of potential in this space you can make Interactive Learning platforms for marketing copywriting legal data science really any craft that takes place digitally and if your tool becomes highly reputable you can even consider issuing certificates that verify a certain level of Knowledge and Skills and again this is not building on top of any existing tool and your competitive advantage in a tool like this becomes your expertise and your ability to create Interactive Learning content rather than solving something highly technical alright the last idea and probably my favorite idea of all of these is just on the border of what I would consider micro SAS but it solves a huge problem a low code integration platform so here's the problem every time we as developers need to integrate other services we need to integrate the whole thing from scratch if I want to have Facebook scheduling as a part of my service I'll have to build the integration from scratch if I want to support slack I'll have to build it from scratch if I want to use any service that offers an API I would have to build it from scratch and so is everyone else so you could build a local solution that lets you integrate with various apis on the internet in a simple and standardized way there are tools like Firebase and Super Bass that saw all this for authentication and databases there are tools like stripe that solve this for payments and subscriptions we need a tool that can connect all kinds of third-party services through an elegant standardized low code solution we have tools like sep here make and if this than that that solves this for no code but these tools are not always ideal when we're building our own products a local solution including a single JavaScript SDK I can use to integrate other services easily would be a killer product and yes we are back to building on top of other tools here however we do this in a much more Diversified way since the idea is to offer easy to connect Integrations with a whole bunch of different tools from a platform risk perspective we're in a much better place here than if we build on top of a single tool like notion or chat TPT whether tool like this can be built entirely by a single person perhaps though I admit that this one is on the border on the other hand if you can pull this one off you're sitting on a super powerful product so if you're considering building any of these ideas please let me know in the comments I'm very interested in hearing more about it also I get this question a lot so I want to make something clear in a video like this I include different tools and different people that I believe are great case studies that we can learn from but neither of them paid me anything or compensated me in any way to include them in fact they don't even know that I'm going to include them whenever I do include paid promotions in my videos I always make it very clear that this is in fact a paid promotion so whenever I mention a tool and I don't say that this is a paid promotion or sponsor it's because it's not finally if you got pumped up about this one you should check out these seven AI SAS ideas that you can build 2023 go ahead and watch that one right now also please give it a like And subscribe to my channel for more content I will see you soon

VIDEO ID: JZ696sbfPHs

================================================================================

this is definitely getting interesting I'm currently running three SAS products and even though my business is heavily centered around software we're actively replacing more and more of our products and infrastructure with no code and AI it stopped being buzzwords and became actual useful tools you can now use to run your business in this video I'll show you seven no code and AI tools that you'd have thought unimaginable 10 years ago and how helpful they are in running your SAS business first let's talk about how to create a website fast the first tool I want to show you is framer framer was originally a JavaScript library for handling CSS animations but they turned into a fully fledged no code website builder and it's surprisingly good if you've ever used figma you'll feel very at home here when you start a new project you get a blank canvas now we can combine different blocks of content by simply using drag and drop we get a ton of different ready-made blocks to choose from and we can set up a CMS collection to handle content dynamically the app itself is really fast and super smooth to use we can set up different breakpoints for a phone and tablet and we can see these side by side as we decide and the whole thing is on one canvas that I can move around and zoom in and out freely and with a single click of a button boom my side is live the biggest disadvantage of using framer is that it's almost too simple you can create very basic websites though you will quickly feel limited compared to tools like webflow on the other hand there's barely any learning curve with framer it's super easy to use I would argue that almost anyone can get a nice looking website ready really fast and they have another really cool feature they have a plug-in for Fitness so if I have a website to sign in figma I can easily turn that into a live website super fast this is very interesting let me get back to that in a second but first let me introduce mid-journey mid journey is an AI technology you can use to generate images from a prompt this means that you can tell mid-journey what you want to design and combine it with example images to take inspiration from and it will spit out some really high quality fully AI generated images this is incredibly useful when we want to sell a product that is silent look and feel of the website has a huge impact on the visitor and mid-journey can help us create really good looking images and graphics for our website when you sign up for a mid-journey account you get access to a Discord Channel and you basically use this as a command prompt to give mid-run instructions for the images you want to create [Music] then we can download them and add it directly to our website but it gets even Wilder framer has a lot of useful ready-made blocks and it makes the website look quite good but let's take it to the next level let's go to dribble and find a website design we like then we're gonna tell mid journey to use this image as inspiration and give it a small description there we go this is perfect we're not stealing anyone's designs here we're just letting mid-journey take inspiration from dribble awesome let's download it and bring it into figma we're going to use this as the background and we're basically going to build the UI on top of this image if you're new to figma don't worry it's an advanced tool and it might seem a bit intimidating at first but trust me it's very easy to get started with take a few basic tutorials and for this use case you should be ready really fast finally we're gonna find a plugin called from figma to HTML in seconds by framer and after a few moments this part of the page should be ready we're gonna hit copy to clipboard create a new page in framer and hit Ctrl V boom now we just need to repeat this for each section and page and we have an amazing AI generated website ready to publish right away no designers no uxrs no programmers just you a few tools and a beautiful website ready in a few hours absolutely incredible alright let's shift the gears here because in order to get our online business off ground we need to do that thing everyone hates marketing but let me show you a few tools that will make your life so incredibly much easier feather is an up and coming tool but it's actually really incredible I can set up a Blog in a few minutes by using notion as a Content management system and blog editor now I have a fast highly SEO optimized blog for my business and I can use notion to write the actual content feather has basic analytics built in and it also lets me customize the style and looks of my blog using these templates and themes and if I want to really customize it I can inject my own custom CSS as well and the best part of course I get to use notion to write the actual blogs let's do a quick stop here and let me show you something else notion AI notion recently launched its own integrated Ai and it's extremely powerful it can finish my sentences it can easily summarize descriptions into action items and it can help you come up with new ideas all from within notion itself check this out ask AI to ride blog posts about let's say bootstrapping a SAS there we go let's add a few images change things up a little hit ready to publish and there we go feather took care of the rest the block is now live marketing done whoa whoa whoa wait a second we still need to take care of social media for this I'm using feed Hive feed Hive is a social media marketing tool powered by AI so we have this AI chat assistant available directly inside the tool it's like chat gbt but this one is trained specifically to help write content for social media and once we finish the post we can let feed Hive say I graded to see how well it thinks it will perform this one wasn't too impressive so feed Hive will make a few suggestions that might work better schedule it and done but here's where it gets really cool we can also combine this with tools like feather and notion using automation with feed Hive I can create a trigger and I can call this trigger from any other service I want and have feed High publisher post on multiple social media channels so for instance when a new blog post is published from feather I use their RSS feed to have a trigger called in feed Hive and it automatically publishes a post to tell my audience about the new blog post this is truly the power of AI and automation at play here also if you don't already know I'm the founder of feed hype this is the tool my team and I built and we're quite proud of it I'm obviously biased here but do go and check it out there's a great chance that you can benefit from this as well next up let's take a look at canva canva is an online editor you can use to create professional looking graphic designs it's really easy to use and perfect for ad creatives and images to go on social media recently they added AI to the mix as well and it's quite impressive what you can do with it we can use it to describe an image or background we want to use in our creative simply drag it in and start editing on top of that it's easy to create anything from abstract patterns to very photorealistic images and these are generated on the fly so they'll always be unique it's a great and super fast way to get some nice images ready the last tool I want to show you is Synthesia Olivia maybe you want to tell them sure thing Simon Synthesia is a tool you can use to create AI avatars for your video I'm one of these avatars myself it's very impressive thank you you can use us for many different use cases presentations video promotions and educational videos exactly I use Synthesia to create internal onboarding videos for My Team Planning and everything else the software is super easy to use you pick an avatar from their library and write what it should say if you want to you can add certain gestures and passes and style of talking then hit generate and after a few minutes or so you have a video of an AI Avatar I just got started with this tool recently and there's so many things I'm going to use this for don't get surprised if Olivia shows up on some of my upcoming videos here on YouTube as well no doubt it's hard to build a startup it takes a lot of grinding and you need to build up an umbrella of different skills though using Ai and no code tools like the ones I've covered here is really a cheat code if you want to learn more about how my team and I became much more productive using AI check out this video next I hope you enjoyed watching please

TITLE: Build a Micro SaaS Using This No Code Tool (Only One Tool Needed)
VIDEO ID: qPHQVZd112U
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPHQVZd112U
================================================================================

no coat just keeps getting better and better we can now build an entire SAS product including membership subscriptions gated content all using one Unified no code tool this is big news for upcoming SAS Founders who don't program last year I showed you how to create a SAS only using no code tool but the problem is we had to use a whole stack of different tools to make this work and it required quite a bit of glue and duct tape to keep it all together what if we could slice away most of this Tower and build it all with one tool instead as it turns out we can webflow recently launched memberships in public Beta And this is everything we need to create and launch in micro SAS using one single no-code tool and it's so cool this basically allows you to create a full and secure user authentication flow manage paid subscriptions through webflow's existing e-commerce solution and create custom gated content for your users without having to use anything but webflow and a stripe account for payment let's consider this idea we want to offer course platform as a SAS we already have a small network of creators who will upload courses regularly and we want to give users access to this platform through a subscription there should be two plans a regular plan and a Premium plan which gives you access to longer and more detailed courses the user should be able to pick a plan when they sign up we can now do all of this with webflow we can create a basic block and flow where users can sign up and we can create separate access groups which give different groups of users access to different content so let's take a look at a webflow site you now have this users button in the menu and by clicking this we can enable memberships on our site we'll get a warning since this isn't beta but once we enable this we will get a section that reminds a bit of the CMS where we can manage content in this setup guide we get a full breakdown of things we need to go through let's go to the e-commerce section and set up our subscription packages the product type is a membership we'll call it learner and we can give it a description and upload images if we want under billing we'll choose subscription we'll set this to nine dollars a month and as we can see webflow does require us to connect a stripe account before publishing this site so you will need to set up a stripe account that you can use to handle payment but it's super easy you can connect it under settings and webflow we'll quickly set up a second membership called premium which is 19 a month webflow really managed to make this a super smooth experience so not only do I not have to worry about user authentication and payment which is something that needs to be super secure but I can also manage my plans and pricing for the SAS within webflow's e-commerce section super cool so now that we have our plans ready we can set up two access groups for each of these plants foreign we're gonna map each of them to the memberships we just created and here's the cool part because the Premium plan should have access to everything on the learner plan plus everything on the Premium plan we can just associate both there we go see how incredibly easy that was we didn't need to write a single line of code we didn't need to create a separate account on member stack we didn't need to set up anything in airtable and we didn't need to glue anything together with sap here now here's where the fun part begins let's head back to the setup guide we can see that webflow wants us to design four different pages here one for signing up and signing in one for the user's account page and one for showing access denied if you're trying to show a part of the app that you don't have access to these are utility pages that webflow set up for us so we don't have to worry about the functionality you just need to design them if you bought a webflow template chances are it included the password page so keep the styling consistent I suggest simply snatching the styles from this one the X's denied page will just leave as is for now and the last one is the user account page let's just give that one a small brush up as well awesome our basic membership system is ready now let's set up what the users are actually signing up for the courses but before I do that let me quickly introduce the sponsor of this video Tiny kiwi tiny Q is a lightweight design tool you can use to create amazing visual creatives in a matter of seconds it's like canva but way easier to figure out take your image or screenshot resize drag and drop add text and background and there literally in seconds and it always ends up looking super professional it's free to use you don't have to sign in literally just go to timekv.io to start using the editor if you want access to more advanced features it costs nine dollars a month that's it okay okay I have to tell you something my team and I were so impressed by this tool that we bought it we literally acquired it and integrated it into our other SAS feed Hive which is a social media management tool so here's the deal today go to the description and find the link and the promo code I've added there this will give you 25 off on the first year on any feed Hive subscription you want and then we'll give you unlimited access to Tiny kiwi for free believe me they play so well together with feed types AI tools and Tiny KV your social media content will never be boring again alright back to the video Let's sum up what we've done so far we've enabled memberships on our webflow website we've set up two paid plans for our members we mapped two access groups to these plants and we'll get back to why that's important in a moment and redesigned the sign in the sign up and the user account page now we need to give our subscribers access to the courses that are available on their plan we'll do this by creating two CMS collections containing the courses that's going to be available on each plan we'll call this one learner courses and we can add any fields that we think will be necessary here all courses will have a name and the slot which is basically a link but we also want to add a thumbnail a description and a URL to a video on Vimeo this is going to be the actual course let's create this collection then duplicate it and call this one premium courses for now the collections will be identical but we could add fields for things like quizzes or FAQs to the premium courses if we wanted to now here's the important part in webflow a CMS collection page will be created for each collection and we can now limit the access to these Pages by using the access groups we created just before so if we click the settings icon for the premium courses template here we can now restrict the access to specific members which in this case would be the premium access group and we'll do the same with the learner courses but here we'll allow members on both access groups since a premium member should also have access to the learner courses as well there we go these collections were now gated behind a subscription paywall and now if we have a page called courses that simply lists all courses that we have available we can keep this page public for everyone to see but if you click a course and you're not on the right plan you will simply see X is denied now this looks very dull but this is an excellent opportunity to highlight all the benefits of being a paying member and prompt the user to upgrade if you're signed in as a paid member you'll get access to the course and the user can now enjoy the content they've been paying for so this is how to set up a course platform as a SAS only using webflow remember this feature is still in beta so changes might happen it's also a bit limited right now for instance you can only have a thousand members on your site but the webflow team has clearly stated that this limitation will be lifted once this feature is out of beta and of course it could be that you want to offer your users something more Dynamic than courses a SAS that has more functionality and solves a problem and thinks a more advanced interface and business logic but hold your horses because webflow is soon going to launch logic which is a way to add Advanced Automation and logic to your website this is going to be a complete Game Changer in the meantime I highly recommend checking out this video up next here I'm going through eight no-code tools that you can use to build a website web apps mobile apps and advanced automation be sure to

TITLE: How to Use A.I. to Run Your Online Business (ChatGPT, FeedHive, GPT-3, Copilot)
VIDEO ID: xWrUNI7adpI

================================================================================

you've probably already heard about it AI is taking over the world closing entire Industries how AI puts your job at risk and finally how to make money using AI it's all over YouTube now if you're not already making 62 000 per month they're trading stocks online with an 88 win rate using chat GPT what are you even doing get rich using chat GPT adapt or die or maybe we know that AI really became mainstream since all the YouTube hustle Bros are throwing themselves at it exactly like they did nfts last year you can't get rich using chat DBT I'm sorry but it's just not that easy AI isn't gonna steal your job but a person using AI might and that's exactly what I'm gonna show you in this video I'll show you five ways you can use AI to become more productive how it helps us innovate and how it helps us generate more revenue for a business no ghost riding stock trading using courses or any stupid like that five ways AI actually massively helps us improve our business let's get started [Music] foreign if you're new here I'm Simon harberg I'm a startup CEO and founder and I'm super excited about SAS Tech and making money on the internet and there's nothing I enjoy more than increasing my output and making myself more productive and as it turns out AI does an amazing job at this let's start with the tool everyone is talking about chat GPT it's only been live for a few months and it's been quite a bumpy ride the creators open AI had to put a ton of limitations in place since people would ask it how to create explosives how to hack banking websites how to write SQL injections and other exploits today it's been dumbed down quite a lot and it generally performs worse on Creative tasks and long form writing though there are still things it does very well one of them is idea generation I use chat GPT to get me started instead of relying on chat EBT to write entire scripts or articles I use it to create an outline I could tell it to write the outline of a YouTube video about pricing psychology and it would come up with ideas for topics I should cover or I could use it to outline the structure of a blog post or newsletter or an ad it does this really well and it's a great way to kick start your flow of writing another obvious way to use this is for YouTube title generation I do this a lot and it works very well with chat TPT I can give it a pretty clear description and constraints and it follows my directions very accurately for typical YouTube video I end up generating 10 to 20 variations of titles and then I pick my top favorite ones this also gives me a few options to split test between sometimes the video just doesn't pick up quite as I had hoped and sometimes changing the title makes the video more clickable there are a ton of other ways you can use chat dvts to generate ideas and create outlines the essence here is that we don't want chat GPT to actually write for us the output just isn't really good enough instead we wanted to get us started and suggest a writing path we can go down though what if there's a way we could somehow use AI to actually write the content for us turns out we can and it's one of the things I use AI for all the time script riding it just requires a little more technical knowledge but honestly you can easily do this without being a programmer or data scientist so here's how it works open AI the same company that runs chat GPT they also have a platform where you get much more fine-grained control over their AI models you have an editor where you can trigger an output just like chat TPT but here you can choose which model you want to use and there are a lot more controls here that you can tweak to make the AI behave in a certain way and here's the best part open AI allows you to fine-tune their models this gives you completely new level control over the output that the AI produces let's just break this down open AI offers you a lot of Base models for instance the text DaVinci 3 model which is used for chat EPC but you can teach these models how to become even more specialized in very specific things by showing them a lot of examples of inputs and the resulting outputs that you want this is known as fine tuning and it creates an entirely new model which now has some new very custom capabilities on top of everything that the base model is already able to do and this is a complete Game Changer do you think I wrote what I'm saying right now I didn't AI did I actually only made a few small modifications before putting this very script on my teleprompter right in front of me but how come it still sounds so much like me it's because I'm using a fine-tuned model I went through hundreds of my own YouTube scripts and cherry-picked individual pieces and used them as an output after a few hours I had a long list of input output pairs that I could use to fine tune The DaVinci 3 model openai has excellent documentation describing exactly how to do this and they have a CLI tool that you can use to prepare the data so it follows the right format then I simply run a command which uploads all the data to open ai's platform and they use this data to train a custom model for me after a while this model appears in the open AI playground if I select it I can now give it an input and yes you guessed it it will generate a new output based on the description but it will sound exactly like me it will even follow the scriptwriting conventions I use including picking a scene adding suggestions for b-roll and everything else my script normally contains this does take a bit of time to set up and if you're not a programmer you need to carefully read open ai's documentation to understand how the fine tuning process works but seriously this is a massive Time Saver and it's something you can't do directly with chat DPT at this point the only downside is that it costs money on opening eyes platform you need to pay for each output you generate but don't worry the prices are very acceptable writing an entire script cost me around 50 cents to a dollar no big deal I've put all the relevant links in the description below you can get started right away alright let's talk about something related creating content for social media there's a chance you might have seen me on social media I'm very active almost everywhere at least based on all major platforms obviously sharing content at scale on five different platforms can get out of hand really quickly so I'm using a social media management tool for this it's called feed Hive and it's using Ai and automation to help you be present on multiple platforms and sharing content at scale feed Hive is undeniably the best social media management solution you can find on the market right now okay okay if you don't know me full transparency here I'm the founder of feed Hive this is one of the SAS products my team and I built but I do firmly believe it's one of the best we put a lot of effort into making AI assist you in a lot of different ways though there's one way we're using AI which I personally find super helpful when I create content a lot of tools can do content writing using AI copy AI paper type chat DPT but they all have the same problem that I pointed out just before the outputs become generic and mostly totally uninteresting it rarely produces anything valuable for your audience and just because you create content at scale doesn't mean you should just post whatever just to post with feed Hive we took a different approach we trained a custom AI model on millions of well-performing posts from our own database but we trained it to do classification instead of trying to simulate the writing of these posts this means that our AI is really good at predicting how well your content is going to perform so in feed Hive you write your post yourself then you click a button now feed Hive will basically give you a score indicating how well it thinks your post is going to perform and often enough you'll get a bad score then we ask feed Hive to describe what's wrong with the post and it will take your content the one you wrote and suggest changes to make it better in this way we still encourage you to write your own content but feedlive is going to polish it adding a few final changes to it that will make it much more likely to catch the attention of your audience and potentially go viral no other social media tools are doing this right now I'm using this on almost all my content and some of my best viral hits in the past few months were all posed that feed Hive helped me modify and rewrite again I'll leave a link in the description below and obviously I'm super biased here but you really should check it out okay okay before we go on let me just show you something funny and kind of bizarre at the same time did you notice anything weird about the thumbnail of this video what if I told you that this is where the thumbnail started I know this is stupid nonetheless yes if right now you're thinking is this thumbnail generated by AI then you're right it's more or less entirely generated by AI yes let me present stable diffusion it's a text to image diffusion model capable of generating photorealistic images given a text input it's absolutely incredible but this technology is able to do one thing is its ability to create mind-blowing and completely photorealistic images in a lot of cases indistinguishable from reality but it gets even crazier you can fine-tune the stable diffusion model on your own images just like we saw with gbt3 and text-based outputs so I now use AI to generate the images of myself for my YouTube thumbnails I'm totally serious here's how I did this I cleaned up a lot of old thumbnails and included just myself and an abstract background so no text or objects I then set up a Google collab and found a template that was pre-made to train stable diffusion model this is all in Python a language I don't know and hands down I don't understand a single line of this code but it also shows that you don't really need to be a programmer to make this work I click the green play buttons for each of these code sections one by one and follow the instructions that are given upload the images and start training after an hour or so I can now give stable diffusion a text input and describe how I should look and which pose I should have and there we go and as you can see this looks kind of weird and very bizarre but with a bit of tweaking and retraining we can actually get it to produce something very realistic looking I found that eyes are mostly a bit of a struggle it's hard to get them perfectly round and have both eyes looking the same direction so typically we do need a little bit of cleanup Photoshop is really helpful here I went through all the images that I used for training and created brushes for my eyes so now I have Happy Eyes surprise dies scared eyes and so on so in order to clean up the AI generated model we just need to find a brush that fits and there we go then a quick bit of recharge adding the rest of the elements and some text and boom thumbnail fair enough I can't fully generate a YouTube thumbnail on its own but still in this way I don't have to put up a camera lights take a bunch of pictures clean them up and all of that instead I can create a finished thumbnail in less than an hour only using my computer it's a massive Time Saver and it's not that hard at all I'll leave a link in the description below that shows a step-by-step guide on how to train a stable diffusion model on your images using Google collab and if you're patient you can do this 100 free of charge otherwise a 10 a month Google collab will speed things up a lot finally an area where I'm using AI extensively is writing software in my company we run multiple SAS products this is the main way we're making money we're using a lot of no code in our setups both for the actual products and behind the scenes to run various automation tasks but we still rely on custom code and software engineering for a lot of things we do and AI is tremendously helpful here I'm using two AI tools for this chat DBT and GitHub co-pilot let me just make it clear none of these will write entire applications for you you do need to be software developer or at least know how to code some in order to take fully advantage of them I've been using GitHub co-pilot for more than a year now it's incredible it finishes my sentences it's able to suggest entire code sections in the same style as the rest of the code base and you can give it small instructions and it will almost flawlessly write these bits of codes for you that's just tedious and annoying to spend mental energy on yourself I rarely have to look up documentation anymore it already knows how mostly all public apis are implemented the names of the methods and the arguments they take I'm saving an incredible amount of time using GitHub co-pilot when I code chat GPT is an entirely different level I can explain a problem and ask it to come up with an entire solution using implementations that I wasn't even aware of it will deliver the code and carefully explain what it does and why it's implemented the way it is it typically won't Ace it on the first try but often it's because the initial information you gave is incomplete and here's where chat LGBT becomes mind-blowing you simply ask it to modify it letting it know about the new edge cases you wanted to cover and explain how it's not producing the result you wanted each time you refine it and give it new information it revises the solution and after a little back and forth like this you have a perfect novel solution to your problem sometimes I even suggest possible solutions to solve some of the edge cases based on the initial solution it provided and it totally takes the ball and dribbles on with it it really feels like an actual pair programming session and it's both faster and way more productive and searching around on stack Overflow for the whole day until you patch things together based on multiple different replies I don't think it would be entirely fair to say that we're making money using AI we certainly aren't getting rich using AI we're making money running our SAS businesses selling info products and running this YouTube channel and it requires a lot of work and effort but it is fair to say that we're using AI to enhance our workflow and drastically increase the output of our business and in that way AI in combination with us humans myself and my team helps us make money online if you got value from this video you should really take a look at this one next here I'll give you five AI SAS ideas that you can build 2023 also remember to give this video a like And subscribe to my channel for more content like this for another video

TITLE: 5 Painful SaaS F*ckups You Should Avoid
VIDEO ID: YsqF2lyYfLk
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsqF2lyYfLk
================================================================================

next up is Simon harberg who figured out a way to hack the market hello sharks I'm gonna create a product that already exists in the market in fact there's hundreds of them already out there but I'm gonna offer a bit of version of that product but set the price significantly lower than any of my competitors see in this way all the users of those other tools would want to use my product instead what [Applause] welcome to my channel I'm Simon harberg one and a half years ago I launched my SAS product feed I and to be fair I was never actually on Shark's Tank that was just me playing around some green screen to make it dramatic intro but I did in fact make one of the most common [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ups I see with new SAS products not nailing the pricing let's just take a look so this was my launch tweet the price of my product was set to five dollars a month and the logic being that with a lower price and a better product everyone would want to come to us right wrong and this is bad for multiple reasons feed Hive is a social media marketing tool and even though it's a low touch product meaning that users can sign up for themselves without interacting with the team it still integrates with a group of third-party social platforms bugs and failures are inevitable so we do need to have a solid customer support experience ready which cost money additionally we're operating in a super competitive market so expecting to grow fully organically without having to spend a substantial amount of money on marketing it's just completely unrealistic so in no way no way could we defend the pricing point of five dollars per month per user secondly it just doesn't have the effect on the user that you think think about it if you come across a product and they price themselves significantly lower than all your competitors what's your first thought that is a shitty product right most people just won't believe it when you say your product is also better because it's not the impression that the price is giving though be careful here nailing the right pricing point doesn't mean increasing the price no matter what and unfortunately there are SAS gurus on the internet that will tell you that raising your prices is the answer to everything it's not I've seen horrible examples of products trying to position themselves as exclusive and premium and reflect that by having prices twice as high as their well-established competitors but if their products are not premium which most products aren't in this initial stage this will backfire so here's the way to do this correctly you should use a strategy I call lean pricing which means that you start at a reasonable pricing point a little below your biggest competitors but not too much now you should aim at increasing the average revenue per user by five percent each month until you meet resistance so let's break this down you can increase the average revenue per user by adjusting different knobs if you have a discount for signing up yearly instead of monthly you can lower this discount or you can aim at getting a bit more users to sign up for a monthly subscription instead of course the trade-off here is that it might hurt retention you can also incentivize users to sign up for higher priced tier this can be done by offering more benefits and features or adjusting the price difference between your plans or by adding a more expensive subscription at the higher end to serve as a pricing anger or finally you could of course just plain down increase your prices though aiming at a revenue increase of five percent instead of only targeting the price Bond itself gives you way more room to experiment with your pricing model at some point you'll need resistance which shows as a decrease or stagnation of new sign ups or people playing down telling you that it's too pricey compared to your competitors I suggest setting up a spreadsheet to calculate this effectively in this way you can also calculate how much churn you're willing to accept as a consequence of the price increase while still increasing your overall Revenue all right the next big mistake I see upcoming sales Founders make is lacking proper execution and I bet you've heard this before but maybe it's not exactly clear what people mean when they talk about good versus bad execution let me try to explain one of my favorite books is this one Lean Startup by Eric Greece in this book they describe this model called build measure learn this is a short feedback loop that enables us to create something test it out measure the effectiveness adapt according to the results and then take that into a new iteration and do the whole thing over again in the world of startups good execution means executing this model very well and here are a few typical ways Founders go wrong about this over and over they start here in the learning step and they get stuck here this means that they do tons of research they want to do this just right so they want to back themselves with as much data as they possibly can and most typically they end up overwhelming themselves causing what's known as analysis paralysis and they simply give up long before they even start executing on anything and the biggest problem is they're not researching on their own data they use any public data they can sniff up and they try to incorporate that into a comprehensive long-term plan that they can feel safe about executing but they never actually create anything which makes it impossible to determine whether their idea will actually work or not when carried out in their specific context then on the contrary you see Founders getting stuck here in the building step this one is so so common among technical Founders they get an idea and then they just start building maybe they'll make a few Google searches or read through a few posts on Reddit and if everything looks good they'll start writing some code they know they probably shouldn't because lean but it's just an MVP you know just to get the idea down they thought it would take a few hours but before they knew it they'd been coding for a day a week two weeks a month three months of building and not a single user had seen their solution yet they never moved on to the missing and learning stage and now they're way too far ahead in one specific made-up direction that they haven't validated yet launch day will most likely be very disappointing though there's actually another variant of this that I'm starting to see more and more it's over execution they built then they quickly launched to see if it catch us on and if it doesn't instead of trying to adapt to the results they just start over they built something new so they are iterating but they just only iterate on the build step and when it doesn't give the desired results they start all over until something eventually hits this is not good execution either this is playing the lottery it's throwing pasta everywhere and hoping that something will eventually stick there are some big influencers in the Indie hacker space who promote this idea excessively and I think that's why we see a surge of new Founders trying this approach and sure some people really did hit it hard using this strategy and they're making millions today but I would call them lottery winners it's not an approach I would model most likely it's not going to work that well great execution is somewhere in between these two extremes you don't want a long and comprehensive business plan so to a certain extent you should definitely just throw yourself at it and get started on the other hand you want to do this in a strategic process-oriented way and not just throwing things out there at random so do some shallow initial research search set some initial goals and create a hypothesis explaining how you're going to reach these build something quickly and get it in the hands of users did you reach the initial goals you set probably you didn't either it went above or below your expectations and in both cases you should hold these results up against your initial assumptions now adapt and do the whole thing again this one is super common as well upcoming Founders believe that in order to create a successful SAS startup they have to create something groundbreaking and Innovative because that's how all the big ones started right Airbnb Uber Tinder bolt just to name a few they all completely disrupt the tick and created entirely new markets so obviously that's what it takes to be fair if you really want to build a unicorn and take it public then shortly you probably do need to disrupt the market in some way but if you don't want that if you're perfectly fine with building a small SAS that do a few Millions a year then you don't have to be discouraged when you go on search for your great idea just to discover that it already has huge competitors in fact that's a super good sign it means that there's a big Margaret for this and that users stand in line for solution to the problem you're trying to solve you just saved yourself a ton of market research and initial validation right there though I totally understand how this can seem discouraging vdive is a social media marketing tool and there was a handful of huge competitors around already not to mention hundreds of small competing products yet feed I was doing great we have more than 10 000 users on the platform and we're turning over more than three hundred thousand dollars each year and we're growing with around 10 to 15 every single month we're stealing users from our biggest competitors every single day because they're old and clunky tools built on outdated Technologies and we simply offer to solve the same problem but with way less friction and with the ability to adapt way faster to new features and changes on the social media platforms and a lot of users are more than willing to change to our solution because of this so don't be afraid of existing markets and big competitors unless you're sitting out to completely disrupt the industry take it as a good sign that you're on to something all right the next mistake I think we're all guilty of but it's super important to be mindful about it it's staying within your comfort zone and working on the easy things this means different things for different people for developers and product Specialists this means constantly optimizing the product they tell themselves that if they just add one more feature or make this thing a bit faster probably users will start coming in deep down they probably know that what's missing is good at marketing but that will require them to get out of their comfort zone which is hard it's much more convenient to just keep doing what you're already good at it could also be designers who keep redesigning the landing page or polishing their product trying to make it more shiny and more attractive while perhaps the core of the product really isn't that good it doesn't really solve the user's problems well it could also be the marketer who keeps optimizing the funnel keeps running new tests keeps trying out new channels and creating complex multi-channel retargeting campaigns while the product is neither looking good or solving the core problem well but that will require looking into product development and learning some coding which is complicated and hard staying in your comfort zone is never the solution and with today's tools and the information we have available there's absolutely no excuses for not doing the hard things if you're a developer you can learn marketing just Open YouTube and get started if you're a marketer you can learn enough programming to build something really cool with the help of no Code and low code tools and if you're a designer you can learn both of these there are no excuses here though if you really feel like moving out of your zone of expertise will be counterproductive the solution is to go and find a co-founder to cover you don't fall into the Trap of Outsourcing the parts you're not good at it's a trap I can almost guarantee it but if you can find a good co-founder that get the same stakes in the businesses you have you can definitely make it work that way as well so this is the last and probably one of the most persistent ones believing that you don't need marketing and that a good product sells itself I don't know the exact statistics but my impression is that founders of SAS products are technical more often than not and Technical fan owners often have a huge barrier when it comes to marketing their products either there's simply two products Centric by nature which makes perfect sense given what they do but I've also met technical Founders who carry a sense of entitlement when it comes to marketing they're typically the kind of people who hate being marketed at or sold to and they somehow feel that marketing is beneath them in either case telling yourself that you don't need marketing is the one and single perfect way to set yourself up for a huge failure with the rise of NOCO tools like webflow bubble sap hearing libraries like react Tailwind chakra UI and so on it has actually become really easy to create great products so everyone's got them now if you think your competitive advantages is a better more high quality product think again because almost everyone can create one of those today what I don't see that often are SAS founders with a clear-cut go to market strategy their distribution channels nailed down and a plan for scale and yes I'm talking about an actual long-term strategy here not just we're gonna launch on product hunt this is much more rare but I can guarantee you that these guys are going to win even if they have a shittier product than you I can honestly say that I've been guilty of these mistakes as well and the most annoying part is that once you start changing these and you start seeing better results you're left with this subtle feeling that you kind of knew all along admitting some of these mistakes for yourself is actually quite harder than simply recognizing them and thinking that they make sense and that's totally okay it's all part of a process my first attempt at launching a SAS product failed miserably I made all these mistakes the second one was feed High the one I'm still running today and in this video I'm gonna show you how I took it to a thousand dollar mrr in the first 30 days and how you can replicate it by doing three simple things if you enjoyed this video please give it a like and remember to subscribe to my channel for more content I will see you soon for another video [Music]

TITLE: 5 Micro SaaS Ideas You Can Start In 2023 (...and Replace Your Job)
VIDEO ID: uYRq60G5XTk

================================================================================

if you're here to disrupt the digital Market of the Next Generation you need to come up with something truly Innovative log into blockchain nfts web 3 augmented reality the metaverse there are so many billion dollar unicorn Tech startups still to be created in this space and if this is what you really want you need to find another video because I have absolutely no idea how to build one of those and also being the founder of one of those companies I actually think it kind of sucks instead I'll give you five quick ideas for a micro SAS that you can build and launch all by yourself and if you play it right can replace your current full-time job within a year I partnered with HubSpot on delivering this video and I actually have a really cool bonus for you but we'll get back to that a little later let's get started if you're new to this channel welcome here I'm Simon horvick I'm a startup CEO and founder and I have a huge passion for doing business online on this channel I'm sharing everything I learned about SAS tick and Entrepreneurship so first of all let's just get the definition straight a micro SAS is a product that focuses on very specific needs typically in a small niche market it's a product that's often created marketed and managed by a single person or a small team at best so if you're an aspiring solopreneur but you don't feel like courses or ebooks is your thing and you have an edge towards the more technical side of things then you should definitely consider launching a micro SAS the first idea building a tool on top of webflow webflow is huge it has a massive amount of users and it's growing rapidly you probably know WordPress and you might also know that some people became millionaires from developing popular WordPress plugins it looks like webflow is heading in the same direction and in a few years we'll have a thriving ecosystem of webflow templates plugins and third-party tools let me show you what I mean there are actually a few tools out there already and they're VC backed and everything this is member stack it's a no code authentication system you can use to create login flows integrate gated content behind paywalls and much more member status expanded to also cover libraries like react but initially this was a tool built for webflow and as you can see it's backed by Y combinator and used by 50 000 people very serious business there's also this one jet boost it's a utility system for webflow that gives you pagination searching sorting lists and a lot of other healthy utilities to manage your CMS collections in webflow also let me just show you this one whist this tool is insane you can basically use this to turn your webflow side into a fully fledged Dynamic web application without having to code it uses a lot of common Concepts from programming but in a drag and drop user-friendly kind of way super cool no doubt there are already businesses doing great in this space webflow just announced logic which is basically a small sapier integrated directly into webflow this opens even more new opportunities to build webflow based applications here's a super quick idea one thing I personally find pretty frustrating when I work with webflow is script management I often end up adding small libraries and dependencies and custom code sections and sometimes I also want to do a little bit of JavaScript to customize some things and this is very tedious so a platform that can manage my script tags and custom code Snippets across all pages in an elegant way and perhaps feature a proper code editor like code sandbox or an extension to vs code that's definitely something I'd pay for and that's just one example there are countless other things you can build on top top of webflow so the next one is a no code website builder or automation service for a specific Niche tools like webflow Squarespace sapier if this than that and so on they're very generalized so a great idea is to make simplified versions of these tools but for very specific niches for instance you can create a landing page builder for yoga studios or hair salons or fitness centers or any other niche market find out what websites in a particular Niche all have in common then create a landing page builder that helps them set up such a website in minutes the same with automation tools you can build a sepio for a specific niche market that covers a lot of Integrations that savior currently doesn't have one great example I can think of is accounting software there are a few big ones out there but it seems like all countries and jurisdictions have their own local tool that are tailored to local laws and regulations for instance when I lived in Denmark I used a software called the Nero now I'm in Switzerland and I use a software called pixio both of them have an API but none of them have sapier Integrations so automating stuff like invoice creation and booking receipts is a big task so you could build sapier for accounting software and then systematically start hunting down local accounting software in all major countries and jurisdictions and simply create automation for them I think I have to be an amazing platform and I would definitely use it myself so those were two ideas that would be relatively straightforward to turn into a micro SAS but in order to get a SAS business started you need more than just an idea you need a name for your business you need a marketing plan you need to estimate and calculate startup costs and if you want to go down the same path as member stack and jetboost and get funding you need to pitch your startup idea to investors yeah launching a startup is hard even if it's a micro SAS but today I want to make your life a little easier let me present HubSpot free business startup kit this bundle includes nine templates that will help you turn one of your ideas into an actual business that's making money you will get a business name brainstorming workbook marketing plan template a business startup cost calculator elevator pitch templates and startup Tech stack checklist and much more and the best part is it's totally free of charge you can go and download it right away I've included the link to this startup kit in the description below thank you HubSpot for sponsoring this video and for creating and sharing these awesome free resources okay this next idea is one that I would pay for in a second a hosted learning management system with an API and a simple JavaScript library I've actually been looking for a tool exactly like this recently and I simply can't find it I'm about to launch a few video courses but I don't want to use these marketplaces like udemy or teachable and I'm not looking for a solution that can handle payment I got all that it covered I'm using stripe and I want these courses to be available for my own domain I'm simply looking for a platform that can handle the content so video courses chapters quizzes q a and so on I started asking around and the closest solution I found was this tutor LMS which is a WordPress plugin it's exactly what I was looking for except I don't want to build my page on WordPress so I think there's a great opportunity here build a similar platform to this but instead of Wordpress offer a rest API and a JavaScript library so I can easily create my own front and then next.js or something like that if it would integrate with webflow using their CMS even better and then we're basically back to the first suggestion again alright the next one is super specific but I actually think there's great ontap potential here build a platform on top of netlify CMS so if you're not already familiar with netlify CMS it's a free and open source content management system that uses git behind the scenes we're using this with feed hype the startup I'm running and it's really cool when our content writer has finished the new blog it generates a markdown file and it creates a pull requesting GitHub for me to review in this way GitHub becomes the database for all our blog posts it's literally a folder with markdown files and we love that it's scalable we can generate static websites from it we fully own all our content and we can use all the features of GitHub like Version Control PR's approval and so on however their UI um I don't want to use bad words here but let's just say that we often have a very frustrated content writer on our team the editing experience is really really lacking and here's where the opportunity comes in build a hosted platform with an outstanding UI ux that features modern fast and responsive editing experience and takes care of all the configuration of setting up in the device CMS so all you need is to sign in with GitHub pick your repository go through a few questions and you're ready to go and then you can still use GitHub as content storage and you can still use pull request versioning and so on and since you wouldn't have to worry about databases and managing domains hosting cname and all of this it would be an extremely low cost SAS to run charge a few dollars per month for the solution I would 100 pay for it now let's shift into something a little different pricing pages build a platform you can use to manage and generate pricing pages so you integrate it with striper pedal and you should be able to easily set up pricing plans choose between different pricing models set up parity pricing local currencies and so on I imagine a tool like this coming with both some basic layouts and the ability to theme and style but also an API and a JavaScript library so you can easily integrate this into a custom front end then you should be able to track and run a b tests directly from the platform so you can test different pricing points whether displaying the price and local currency performs better testing pricing anchors and discounts and so on I'm actually surprised there isn't a tool like this already out there I know stripe is planning on introducing pricing tables that you can embed directly onto your page which is cool but as far as I know they won't have a b testing and tracking and my impression is that it's going to be similar to their hosted checkout which sure you can customize a little but it's gonna still look generic and stripy so I think there's still room for a product like this and who knows you can roll fast on something like this one of the big guys like stripe might want to acquire it I think nailing the right pricing model and the right pricing page is a form of art when it comes to assess and it's hardly under prioritized by many sales Founders so a tool like this would definitely help making the pricing page itself a bigger deal and reduce friction in setting it up so as you might have noticed these five ideas were much more about tapping into existing markets and established products and adding additional features or removing additional friction with micro sets it's not really about creating full-scale Solutions or creating new markets so these were five quick ones you could consider moving forward with but honestly I could easily throw in another 20 if we had the time because these ideas easily come up once you start looking for them in a different way try to pay attention while you work especially if you're using other tools every time you have to do something extra and possibly mundane and repetitive consider if this might be an idea for microsass you'd be surprised how many people are actually willing to pay a fee to remove a small but frequent pain hopefully after watching this video you'll start coming up with a ton of new ideas so remember to pick up hotspot's free business startup kit and once you get an idea that you're really psyched about take a look at this video before you go on here I'm teaching you how you can determine if your idea is actually worth moving forward with I suggest you click right here and watch this video right now if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and hey subscribe to my channel I'd love to see you back here for another video [Music]

TITLE: I Created a SaaS Only Using No Code Tools - Part 1
VIDEO ID: 00i3JRAQ_w4
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00i3JRAQ_w4
================================================================================

let me present the next generation crypto platform crypto view never lose track of your net worth in crypto currencies a sas product you won't forget also i created this sas only using no code tools and in this video i'll show you how you can do it as well [Music] welcome to my youtube channel and thanks a lot for picking this video i'm simon horberg and i talk a lot about tech sas and online business and if you've been a subscriber to this channel you might remember that i did a video about the perfect tech stack for a sas product a few months ago it's the perfect tech stack for a sas product but the only problem is it contained a whole lot of very complicated code and if you're not a programmer i wouldn't blame you for being completely demoralized while watching it like do i need to understand all this to build a sas fortunately no you can actually build a fully fledged sas product entirely using no-code tools is it beneficial to know programming to store the sas business well of course do you have to no and that's exactly what i'll show you in this video i'll show you how to build your own sas platform including a landing page login system custom user data all without writing a single line of code or to be fair we do need to write a tiny bit of code to make this work but as you'll see it's really not that complicated let's get started let's start by breaking down how we're going to build this and which tools we're going to use we need a website for a product it will contain the marketing material and a page for plans and pricing and a place to sign up it will also contain the actual web app that you get access to after you subscribe to a paid plan in this video i'll refer to this as gated content for this part we'll be using webflow we also need a way to handle subscriptions and payments so people can sign up pick a plan and log in to handle subscriptions we'll be using member stack to process payments we'll be using stripe both member stack and stripe have solutions for no code as well as low code this means that as a sas scale and we may hire developers to do something more custom for us in the future both member stack and stripe can easily be integrated in a new solution now in order to deliver custom functionality for our users we need a database in this case we want users to add their own cryptocurrency assets to their lists and see them when they log in in almost any case we need a database to store data we'll be using airtable for this finally we need something to tie all the pieces together so they can communicate with each other we'll use zapier for this so our no code tech stack will look something like this of course in a more real life scenario i had to add more tools to this setup an important one would be an email service i recommend using sendgrid to handle marketing emails is one of the most reliable services out there and it's pretty straightforward to integrate into your service also if you're not a programmer additionally in order to make your email stand out professional for you and your team i'd recommend using why stamp for email signatures so why stamp is a tool that you can use to create beautiful and professional looking email signatures it's super easy to add your name title link to your social channels and you can pick from a ton of templates can even add your own handwritten signature which i think is super cool and here's the best part if you're a business owner and you manage a team you can add all your employees here and make sure that all signatures from the whole team are streamlined and always up to date you can sign up for free so check out the description below i've added a link that will get you started right away why stamp is also the sponsor of this video so i want to say thank you to the y stamp team for supporting this channel alright let's start getting our hands dirty here the first thing we want to do is to set up an amazing looking website let me introduce webflow a no-code tool for building websites let's head over to webflow and create an account now we'll hit new site and get ready to set up a website so we can create a site from scratch or we can pick a template to start from we're definitely going to be picking a template so the trick is to find one that already looks a lot like the side we imagined for a sas so we don't have to change too much so i'm simply going to search for sass and then let's see what we get i love this one seems like a perfect fit let's get it alright so here we are ready to create this website most of this actually looks good as it is we're just gonna change the copy around here there and there we go now let's just delete these menu items and let's just clean up a few of these sections we don't need so the graphic work here is already outstanding but let's just bring it into figma quickly and add a bit of crypto vibe to it now i'm literally just gonna add some crypto icons to these of course in a real world example you probably want to hire a designer or if you are one spend some more time getting this just right but for now this is great so let's continue giving this page an overhaul it's probably worth pointing out that if you have no experience with html or css whatsoever webflow might feel a little steep when you're just starting out but don't worry webflow has a ton of educational videos in their webflow university and no you don't need to learn html and css in order to make this work just pick a template change things up like i just did here stick to the overall structure and don't get into anything too crazy and you'll be just fine let's go to the pricing page and add a few items here that makes a little more sense there we go i'm happy with this let's publish it done i think this looks really good and this took me almost no time to set up all right now that we have the website done the next thing we need is to create a user login system you also want a way for people to sign up and subscribe to our sas so let's create two pages a login page and a sign up page most of these webflow templates comes with a password utility page let's just copy the layout from this one and modify it slightly now we can just copy the sign up page and make a login page out of it as well now let's make sure the login button sends us to the login page and the get started button will send us to the pricing page so we just want to make sure that clicking on any of the price columns will send us to the sign up page there we go let's publish it alright it's time to create the login system let me present member stack a no code tool used to create logins and payments for your website let's head over to memberstack.io let's create an account then let's add a website from webflow and we'll simply follow these steps let's create a membership and call it professional plan yes we want to require payment and we'll just set a price here and as you can see we can also enable free trials collect taxes and more but we'll just leave it at this for now now we want to pick a part of our website to hide behind the paid membership in this case we want to hide anything on a special portfolio site so this would be anything on our website slash portfolio if people try to visit this page but they're not logged in we'll simply redirect them to the login page awesome that's basically it now let's head over to power-ups and pick member specific pages we want to activate this and add the portfolio path here as well finally we need to integrate the member stack functionality on our webflow site we do this by adding the piece of code right here then head over to webflow click project settings then click the custom code tab then we'll simply add the code here do note that adding custom code to webflow is a paid feature so you'll need a site plan to do this but you can get this for as low as 12 dollars per month and you'll need this to host your website on your own domain anyway so if you haven't upgraded to a side plan already this is a good time to do so now let's create a signup and login form in member stack and wired together with the signup and login page we created in webflow just before so let's go to the form and field section on member stack and create a sign up form we basically want an email field and a password field but we're also going to create a third one called webflow member id but we actually want to hide this one so the user won't see this field on the page but we need it in order to link member stack and webflow together now let's click on the email field we can see that it shows the custom attribute with the name data ms member and the value email let's go and add that to the email field on the login page we'll do the same with the password field and finally we can see that we need to add this to the actual form that wraps both fields let's publish and quickly verify that it works we're gonna sign up here and we're gonna go to the members section in member stack there we go the member got created now the next step is to start wiring things together first we need to create a collection where we can store each member in webflow cms we'll call it members now let's add a few fields the name and slog fields are mandatory that will simply be the name of the member and slug the slug is the last part of the url which will be used to identify a specific member on the page each user also need a field to store their email address and finally we want to add a field for some custom data crypto view is still in beta so the only thing we will be able to do once we sign in is to add cryptocurrencies to a portfolio along with the amount of them that we own so let's create a field called crypto assets that we'll use to store this data and we'll simply pick a plain text field for this now let's save this collection and as we can see here there's no items in this collection yet since we don't have any users in the system now when you create a collection in webflow it'll automatically produce this cms collection page this page is what users see when they log in for now let's just add a text saying portfolio and the button saying add crypto there we go all right let's just get an overview of what's going on here the idea is that when a user signs up a new member will be created in member stack that will trigger an event that creates a new member item in the cms collection in webflow which will again create an event that passes back the webflow member id from the collection into the member in member stack in that way we have both systems nicely tied together but how do we do this let me present zapier a no-code tool that we can use to connect services on the internet let's go over to zapier and create a new account now let's create a new sap and call it webflow plus member stack sign up under app event let's search for member stack the event trigger we want is new member next zapier needs to be connected to member stack so let's go to power-ups then find api key under sapieu next let's create an action we're going to search for webflow here we're gonna pick create live item and also here we'll connect zapier with webflow but it should pick up from the account you're signed into so let's pick the site it'll be crypto view and the collection we call this members now for the email field we'll simply pick email from the event crypto assets will leave blank for the name let's just add the email again we could have created a form containing a field for a username but we're keeping it simple here and for this slug we want to use the member stack id it's simply called id that's it for the webflow action we'll actually add another action to the chain right away because we want to now update the member in member stack so we'll pick update member and we want to update the member based on the id we got from the newly created member so we'll pick the id here now we want to add the webflow member id here so we'll pick from the member collection item we just created and choose the id field and for the member page we want to use the id of the member stack member and that's basically it let's turn this sap on and test out the whole thing so we're gonna sign up for new user we can see the memory got created in you can also see that the sap added a webflow member id and added a unique slog for our member page awesome let's go to our webflow cms collection and see there's a new member looks good let's just double check the slog has the same id as the member page yes and the item id from this item became the webflow member id and members deck yes so that's it webflow and member stack are now totally in sync using sap here isn't that just freaking awesome so at this point we can create a user subscribe to a paid plan and log in to see a part of the website that is gated behind a paywall and so far we haven't written a single line of code in order to make this work in real life all we have to do is add stripe payment which is super easy to do directly from member stack it's absolutely incredible but we're not done yet we still need to add some actual functionality to this sas which includes storing user data in a database i will cover all of this in part two of this video which i will publish very soon so you definitely want to subscribe to my channel and turn on notifications so you won't miss it i'll see you soon for part two

TITLE: How To Find BRILLIANT SaaS Ideas
VIDEO ID: -E7zpZbG9cY
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E7zpZbG9cY
================================================================================

I still remember how it all started it was late 2019 and I was working with a startup as a software consultant my colleague and I were joking around talking about how we should start our own Tech startup we could make it a Challenge 100 days to create a tech startup from scratch we'll call it 100 days of take startup at first I wasn't really serious but the idea stuck around with me for the rest of that day and it didn't take long before I decided to do it so the mission was clear I was going to create and launch a SAS product in 100 days first stop I needed a brilliant idea so I thought to myself what's missing in software development I was thinking back to my time in sales from before changing my career to software and immediately it hit me leaderboards We Loved These in sales we had huge TV screens plastered all over the place displaying who was ranking highest on sales and revenue and it was highly motivating to all of us that was it this was clearly missing in development we need a way to see who reviewed most PRS who committed most changes and for the managers they could use it to report on the team's performance as a whole this SAS idea was brilliant I just knew it from the start and the competition was low almost non-existing perfect I slammed together a landing page posted on social media and yes people signed up for the newsletter this was exactly the validation I needed I spent the next 90 days building the MVP of the product Sig medic was born on day night 99 the product was ready I just needed to press the launch button I sent out emails to everyone who signed up I posted on Reddit Indie hackers launched on product hunt and on day 100 I was ready to see this product take off then I waited I waited some more no one from the newsletter signed up I checked Reddit two ups product hun five uploads Indie hackers nothing it just drowned after watching the screen for around 10 10 hours straight it was pretty clear no one was going to upgrade to a pay plan in fact not even a single person signed up another 10 days had to go by before I finally realized it this was one huge [Music] failure welcome to my little space here in YouTube and thank you so much for jumping into this video I'm Simon harberg and obviously there's more to this story in fact I am running a profitable SAS product today and I use this YouTube channel to share my experience with doing business online so since you're here you're probably interested in starting your own SAS product maybe you even have a story similar to mine in this video I'll teach you how to come up with the SAS idea that actually has potential and how to spot warning signs that might deceptively make you think that you have a great idea while in reality the idea is worthless so let's try to flip this around in order to come up with a great SAS idea with potential it's actually more about taking an idea and putting it through some aggressive stress testing to see if we can tear the idea down if the idea passes these tests there might actually be something to work with so let me go through three tests you should put your SAS idea through if you already have a SAS idea in mind you can see if they pass the test throughout this video in each of these tests you need to keep three essential pillars in mind viability can your SAS idea make money Fe ability can your SAS idea realistically be carried out desirability does anyone actually want it you need to be able to close this triangle there's going to be no business if either of these are missing so here we go test number one dog fooding are you able to consume your own product while you create it the best products are made by creators who are solving their own problems imagine a sass that would make your life much easier this also means that you should ask yourself do I have enough experience to understand the problem I'm trying to solve at scale I'm sure you've had problems staying organized and coming up with a new approach to creating to-do lists might solve a problem for you but there should be room for growth and maturity so what happens when you scale your to-do list app into a project management tool like J or clickup do you have experience as a project manager on large scale projects have you ever managed a team and delegated work these questions are important and they apply to any idea you might have if you've never tried dealing with recruiting in the hundreds probably you don't want to build an HR solution if you've never worked in a big organization probably you don't want to build a team collaboration tool or an internal Vicki if you've never run an agency hiring out Consultants by the hour maybe you don't want to create a Time tracking tool not only does dog fooding ensure that you perfectly know the frustration of the user but it also helps create trust in you as a Founder if you don't understand your problem very well it will be hard to comprehend whether it's realistic to carry out a solution for it it's also hard to verify if anyone really wants it if you're not on that list yourself when I was building sigic I completely failed to realize that my triangle was broken I did not have experience as a product owner or being in a role where observing and Reporting my development teams performance was crucial what I also failed to understand was that development teams aren't sales teams it's a completely different culture developers simply don't get motivated by having a dashboard showing who closed the most PRS taking experience from one Arena and moving it to another one simply just doesn't work all right let's move on to test number two is your problem worth solving you need to make sure your problem is big and frequent enough that it's viable to build a sass around solving it I want you to consider these four quadrants identify to which your problem belongs you might have a big but infrequent problem it's a huge pain when it happens but it doesn't happen that often this could be TR Trel planning generating complex yearly Financial reports filtering job candidates and so on it's a good place to be users are definitely willing to pay for solving big problems so if your problem is in this quadrant it'll pass the test similarly you might be dealing with a small but frequent problem it's not really a big deal but it simply happens so often that it becomes a big deal an example could be sharing files between devices or tracking expenses on the fly or visualizing data that would otherwise take time to do in a spreadsheet again it's a good place to be you can find users who are more than willing to pay for solving small but recurring problems so also here we'll let the idea pass the test now you might be dealing with a small and infrequent problem it's not really a big deal and it happens so rarely that it never becomes a big headache so the problem is there you can probably find users who will recognize it but it's neither frequent nor big enough that you'll have them pay to solve it this is a huge warning sign and we cannot let the idea pass the test if it's found in this quadrant finally you might be dealing with a problem that is big and frequent this could be collaborating on designs managing projects maintaining internal knowledge bases for big organizations and so on this is the best place to be so if your the test with a huge A+ it's important to understand if your problem is big enough to build a viable business around the solution some problems are just not worth solving if I had put a little more thought into this while I was building sigic I would have realized that reporting on a development team's performance is both small and infrequent tools like jira already have excellent inbuilt support for reporting on Project level hence reporting on the team's performance would only be necessary in case of occasional hidden bottlenecks which could even still be solved in a different way and the idea of a leaderboard for development teams wasn't even solving a problem at all sigmatic would not have passed this test let's move on to test number three can you afford the price of your product maybe you're not able to charge enough to make your business survive finding the right pricing point for your product can be very very tricky and there's this Mantra going around that claims that you should raise your prices almost no matter what this is of course ridiculous as such there's nothing wrong with a cheap product you can definitely build a great business around that but you need to make sure you can afford the low price let's consider another four quadrants this time we're going to look at the revenue you get from each user versus the expenses you can expect from each user your product might have a high price so it generates a lot of revenue from each user but in turn each user is costly perhaps there's a high server cost associated with the usage or maybe the product is complex so extensive onboarding and customer support are needed your product could also have a high customer acquisition cost which is common if you're advertising in a very competitive space this is okay High Revenue makes room for high expenses so if your product falls into this quadrant it'll pass the test in the same way you might offer a low price product but you have very little overhead cost associated with each user so your product is very simple intuitive to use and more or less bug free users can sign up and get started without any help and they come from word of mouth so no need for expensive advertisement this is perfectly fine low Revenue per user but also very low cost this means you can scale the number of users without having to worry about lot of extra expenses if your product falls into this category it passes the test and in a case like this most likely you don't want to raise your prices instead you want to look into ways of attracting more users if you have an idea that supports a high Revenue per user but it's also super simple intuitive and scalable at a low cost you've hit a really really good idea obviously this is the ideal quadrant to find your SAS idea in however it's unrealistic in most cases there are very few products that find themselves here and as You' probably figured the last quadrant is posing a huge problem if your product does not incentivize users to pay a high price but at the same time is complex needs extensive onboarding support and exist in a very competitive space I'm sorry but your idea will not pass the test the triangle is broken ironically I actually didn't mess up with sigmatic on this one I was planning on charging $60 per month for this comp complet irrelevant product that no one needed and it would have been very low cost both in acquisition since there was no competition and I think quite intuitive to use so it was placed very nicely in that ideal quadrant but since it didn't pass any other tests so far it wouldn't even have gotten to this place but I did actually screw this one up at the current sass that I'm running when I launched feed hiive in public beta last year it started out at a pricing point of $5 per month a social media management tool which core features are entirely based on Integrations with third-party platforms will never be fully smooth and bug free we're also using expensive AI as a service providers and we're acquiring users through advertisement in a very competitive space so the price point of $5 per month would have never been possible fortunately we did realize this and we adjusted our pricing accordingly today we charge $19 $29 $99 per month depending on the plan with feed Ty we solve a problem that is both big and frequent among our users and because our team has extensive experience with social media we are able to constantly dog food our own product and develop new features to stay competitive and for that reason our users are more than happy to pay a higher price I'm super happy that I got the chance to build a failure it was fun very interesting and I learned a tremendous lot from it and in fact the 100 days of take startup challenge was about exactly that gaining knowledge and experience that would be useful for the day it really matters mattered so I'll totally recommend doing this as well if you want to create a SAS but you have no experience at all start by creating your first one but have absolutely no expectations that it will actually succeed cuz that's totally not what I was doing with sigmatic I totally believe that this idea would take off and become super successful and I know now that if I had put my idea through these tests it would have been very clear that my idea was not viable at all neither was it feasible because I didn't even have a clear idea about who exactly I was building for and most importantly it was completely undesirable no one wanted it but I'm super happy I learned this because this made my second startup feed hiive succeed and become profitable this is only part of the story though cuz there were other things I completely missed when building sigmatic and that changed everything once I understood it if your SAS idea passed all tests be sure to watch this video as well understanding these metrics will change everything for you if if you enjoyed this video

TITLE: I Make $5,000 Per Month On Autopilot Doing This
VIDEO ID: 1Wq5itfNNnE

================================================================================

i was desperately trying to get a passive income stream up and running i wasn't expecting to get rich or anything but you know an income might be able to actually feel and there is just so much useless advice out there either i had to research or understand a tremendous lot like with crypto or nfts or i had to build up a huge stock portfolio with money that i just didn't have so i was looking towards info products it seemed like a perfect fit creating an ebook was definitely something i could work out and people on the internet was clearly making an insane amount of money from this but as it turned out there's a huge problem if you've ever tried selling an info product you're probably very familiar with it when you launch you'll see sales starting to come in but it quickly fizzles out in fact even very successful ebook authors and course creators experienced this after a few weeks sales just more or less stopped coming in i didn't really care about making hundreds of thousands of dollars at launch i just wanted a product that would consistently sell month after month so i was looking towards paid ads this seemed to be the perfect solution for what i was trying to achieve and as it turned out it did not work well not only did my ebook not sell but now i was even losing money but this was where i started to get stubborn about this i thought this was going to be the perfect passive income stream if i could make it work it had to work so i started doing research i played around with the settings of my ass different target audiences i wasted more money i tried a b testing the landing page changed the ad copy still nothing at this point i was super close to giving up when finally and yes the profit margin was the same i finally nailed it a 5 000 monthly passive income stream exactly what i was looking for after digging deep and understanding these results i narrowed down three core elements that actually made my selling system work and here i am in this video ready to share them all with you welcome to my little space here on youtube and thank you so much for jumping into this video i'm simon hoiberg and this is the space i use to share everything i know about making money on the internet so if you're also totally hooked on tech sas business and entrepreneurship or just want to get started making money online then you're in great company here you probably heard people talking about how it's important to build multiple revenue streams and passive income seems to be one of the hardest topics out there the reason why i quote the passive part here is that the idea is being thrown around and misused quite a bit some people use this to make it sound like you can earn money without doing anything in my world you can only obtain truly passive income by investing which i by the way 100 recommend you to do as well but that's a totally different topic in this context it's more about earning money that is not a direct product of your time so you put in some initial time work and effort to build an asset and after that you can make money from this asset without barely spending any time on it so it's that last part i call passive income in this context but i'm just gonna make it super clear that it does not mean that you don't have to put in time and effort to make this work the idea is straightforward you need a product in my case it's my ebooks but it could also be physical products that you sell from drop shipping for instance you need a website you can sell from you can either set one up yourself or use tools like webflow and shopify finally you need to run ads images are super important here so you're gonna need a tool to create some nice visuals i use figment but canva is a super popular choice here since it's easier to get started so users on facebook instagram and youtube will see your ads some will click on it and get directed to your landing page and some will purchase a copy or an item the great thing about this model is that as soon as you nail down something that really works it's easy to turn the knob and volume up sales you want to sell more copies or items you simply increase the ad budget so let's assume that you already have a product in place now let me break down three core elements that makes this system work first one great ads that make people click so let's take a look at how facebook's ad platform works behind the scenes when you're running ads to sell you always want to pick a conversion campaign don't run a campaign for website clicks it won't work nearly as effective in order to run a conversion campaign you need to install the facebook pixel on your landing page and trigger a conversion event every time someone buys your product this event will feed back to facebook and let it know that your goal with running the ad was achieved facebook uses very advanced ai technology and reinforcement learning to narrow in and become better at showing exactly your ad to the right people so it's important that every time facebook sends a visitor to your website you hand them this little bill that they can ring when they do something you want facebook to give you more of that's what the facebook pixel is this is why you don't want to optimize against website clicks and why you don't want to narrow down a specific target audience either trust me facebook is better at figuring out who to sell your product to than you are however well you think you know your target audience so don't narrow by interest age occupation and so on keep a super wide audience and let facebook do its thing this is also why you'll notice that your ads are not performing that well when you launch the campaign it's because facebook needs a bit of time to train the ai will try to make certain assumptions about your ad based on the ad copy the image but really it mostly starts showing the ads to people somewhat at random but by ringing that little bill you'll teach facebook when something worked and it will start figuring out the patterns as a rule of thumb you need 10 to 20 sales to get facebook through training and you can expect to spend at least three times the average price of a sale on ads before seeing any significant results facebook's internal machinery is extremely powerful and once it's tuned in it will start delivering some really good results but it's not a magic platform facebook is really good at getting your ad in front of the right people but you still need to craft a great ad in order to get visitors so here are some things to keep in mind create eye-popping visuals you want something that catches people's attention and makes them stop scrolling the visuals should be vibrant and colorful and shouldn't contain too much text you have around one and a half second to catch people's attention so try to make this test on yourself open your eyes look at the image close them after one and a half second did you manage to get a clear impression of what this ad is about if it's too busy too overloaded or contains too much text the human brain doesn't get a chance to establish an impression in this short amount of time facebook's ad platform allows you to select different images for different placements so make sure you'll have a version that works well on the timeline on stories and in search results generally you want to create three different distinct versions a regular 4x4 a 69 and a 9 16. with these three variants you can adjust your images to work well on all placements also if you're brave make a small video and run this as an ad on reels i've personally had very good results with this though video ads are a bit more advanced and it can't be more difficult to make something that really catches people's attention another version i've seen often is animated visuals in video or gif format so as users scroll by it appears as if your ad is animating into the view this can be a great way to catch people's attention as well lastly you want great copy this is the second most important element of a great ad you want to keep the text short and concise space it out so it's not appearing as a wall of text lists are great to sum up a good deal get personal with your audience don't say we or us if your personal brand use i and me avoid technical terms and buzz words speak in a natural language that people understand use emojis a bit of colors and graphics within the text itself also makes it look more appealing and eye-catching include a clear call to action don't confuse the viewer make it clear what this ad is about what you want the viewer to do and what the outcome is finally and this one is super important include a deal running either a discounted offer or a deal where the buyer gets something extra works really really well it creates incentive you've probably seen people doing this urgency technique where they put only for the next hour and they have this countdown showing on their landing page i would strongly advise against this kind of technique as it comes off scammy on a lot of people instead of rushing people and catering to fomo focus on incentive instead that said running a discounted offer for a time limited period can work well but keep the focus on the amazing product and what they get out of it instead of highlighting how fast people need to move in order to lock it down let's summarize it we need to run conversion campaigns using the facebook pixel and we need to keep the target audience brought so facebook get a lot of leeway to do its thing we need eye popping visuals that make the viewer want to stop scrolling we need great ad copy that sells your product in an easy to read and concise way finally we need to include a deal that creates extra incentive to go and check out your product nailing down the right ad creatives does require a bit of practice and a bit of experimenting with different things and while facebook's ad platform is incredibly affordable this will cost you some money and you should be prepared to throw some money away on simply experimenting and getting it right fortunately facebook's ad platform is a great tool seems like those guys at facebook almost spent more time making that a great experience than facebook itself which i guess kind of makes sense after all that is where money comes from it offers you a lot of ways to quickly create new ads adjust the creatives run a b test create multiple ads under the same ad set to see which one performs better and so on if you want to learn more about running facebook ads please check out ben heath here on youtube he's the ceo of lead guru an advertisement agency and he is a facebook ad specialist alright that was the first one again facebook will only help you get your ad in front of the right people and with a tight ad creative you will now have visitors coming to your landing page so naturally that's the second core element you need to nail down in order to make this selling system work a professional visually appealing landing page that sells obviously this can be done in many different ways though there are some general elements that you should consider including but first of all let me just make it clear that you don't have to be a programmer to set up a great landing page there are a lot of great tools like webflow wix squarespace and even shopify you can use to build something really good in fact even if you are a programmer i suggest you take a look at these tools just to save yourself some time alright let's break down a few things your landing page must have in order to work with your ads yes must have make sure you can check all of these off your landing page must align with the ad if you're selling a specific product make sure that the actual product page is where you direct your visitors if the landing page presents something different from the ad content that's known as a bait and switch and it's against facebook's guidelines ideally the landing page should also follow the same brand colors and design as the ad make it feel familiar as soon as the visitor enters it must be fully functional if the app is crashing half of the time not only will you lose conversions but facebook might actually deactivate your ad altogether so make sure your landing page works is fast to load and is responsive and while we're at responsiveness make sure to optimize for mobile this shouldn't come as a surprise but most of your visitors will come from a mobile phone so besides making sure your landing page is fully responsive make the mobile experience the primary experience make sure it's a great user experience that everything looks really nice lastly make sure you don't have other apps on your landing page like banners from google adsense it's a really poor experience first of all but facebook might actually deactivate your ad if the first thing visitors are met with is another ad they have to click through to get to your landing page so when you design your landing page keep these super important points in mind now let's take a look at some good practices for maximizing the effectiveness of your landing page in combination with the ad your landing page should contain a hero section with a strong headline while you could put the title of your info product or name of the item here it will be a bit of a wasted opportunity since you will present the product including the title and a description a little bit further down on the page what i suggest is a headline that describes the outcome of buying your product preferably using a strong verb at the beginning of the sentence the outcome can be either what you get or how you solve a problem this could be stop wasting money on ads that don't convert or improve your landing page design and start selling more or learn how to build a website from scratch and just below the headline you should have a subheading that briefly sums up what your product is about so a full example could be stop wasting money on ads that don't convert the youtube video that will reveal the truth about realistic money making from running ads if i were to sell this exact youtube video right here the headline and subheading could probably go something like that let's take a few actual examples though here we have robert who's selling a flutter course notice the headline outcome of buying the product introduced by a strong verb robert has a very short subheading here but notice how he's using a video to demonstrate his product which is actually complementary to the subheading this is a great way to further establish trust and demo videos are well known to convert more sales so here we have josh who's selling a css course again he's describing the outcome with one tight sentence here and he's using the super strong verb stop to introduce his headline really well done and joss also uses the subheading to describe what the course is about a little fun fact josh turned over more than five hundred thousand dollars just in pre-sale for this course when it comes to info product he is an absolute elite player let's look at an example here from west boss this website is very different from what you normally see and it very much stands out but again wes boss managed to limit his headline to a two word sentence master gatsby still describes the outcome and still start with a strong verb excellent work and again he's using the subheading to further elaborate on what his course is about last up let me bring in my own landing page as an example here once again you see how i follow the same pattern describing the outcome and starting out with a verb and also here i use the subheading to describe what you will learn from my ebook this right here is one of the ebooks that's making me more than five thousand dollars every month by the way so from here you'll of course spend some of your website real estate to further describe the product outline the content bring out some of the usps from this product obviously you'll also need a place where you can actually click to purchase the product and you'll need a checkout system to handle payment however there are two more things that i believe is an absolute must-have for these kinds of landing pages you need to have an explainer video or a video demonstrating your product as we saw before robot actually added his video as one of the first things to see when you land on his website but you'll notice that jaws got one as well if we scroll a little bit further down we also see that wes boss has won here for his master gatsby course and i got one as well when you scroll down a little further it is well known to increase conversions but it's also a great opportunity to let the visitor get a sense of who you are none of us are celebrities so when a user comes to your website it may very well be the first time they ever hear about you use the video to establish a connection and leave an impression obviously explain what they get from this product and why they should invest in it but use this as an opportunity to let them hear your voice see your face and actually get a sense of who you are as a person you will be amazed how much better your product will sell if you're not just an anonymous person people want to know who you are the next one is testimonials this is absolutely crucial in order to have your product effectively sell ideally you want at least one main testimonial from a person that is well known in the niche you're selling in you can see how jaws got a testimonial from kenneth c dodds who's a well-known author and open source creator himself i got a testimonial from oliver jumpers who's a huge influencer in the tech twitter space and if you look through the first handful of my testimonials you'll actually notice that these people are all highly influential with huge audiences now full disclosure these are my friends and colleagues i talk to them every day and we do business all the time that doesn't mean that their testimonials are not genuine these guys have their own reputation to care about so they wouldn't just say things if it wasn't true but you may not be in a network of creators like this so getting testimonials from these people isn't just something you can just acquire however i want to say two things about that one don't be afraid to reach out to these people even if they don't know who you are a good example mass broad the author of mastering the coding mindset actually reached out to brad traversi who's a huge youtuber with almost 2 million subscribers and asked him for a testimonial they didn't know each other at the time and mass only had a few thousand followers when he launched this book but brad is a super nice and helpful guy and he said yes and mass got a killer testimonial to highlight on his landing page now this doesn't mean that brad is guaranteed to hand out testimonials so please don't go and spam his inbox he's a very busy man and it's likely that you won't get an answer but the point is even if you're in no circles of other creators don't be afraid to try two the testimonials don't have to come from influential people all testimonials are great and as long as you can include an actual name a profile image and preferably a link to a person's social account then they're still good again i will call this a must-have before you launch you need to reach out to at least 5 to 10 people and have them give a testimonial and you need to include this on your landing page alright so now you have amazing ads with awesome ad creators and great copy you have an incredible landing page with a sharp headline a video and a handful of testimonials at this point you can start a campaign and start selling if you carried all of this out you are very likely to have a great start on this business however there's a third element that i want to highlight while it's not strictly mandatory in order to sell it will definitely help you convert more and this is the thing you may not want to hear but here it goes social proof you want to have an active social media presence an engaged audience and great content that relates to your product but that you give out for free when you create an ad on facebook it will run on all of facebook's products including instagram and the ad itself will show as if it's posted from your facebook page or instagram profile so make sure you're active here preferably on both facebook and instagram what happens is that when people see your ad they are very likely to click on your profile to see who you are what people see here can be a determining factor for the success of your campaign will they see a completely empty profile with no posts no followers and no engagement or will they see an active profile tons of great content a lot of followers and a lot of engagement and you in the comments answering people's questions and being super helpful in which of these two scenarios do you think people would be more willing to check out your product even if your ad creatives are great and your landing page is amazing it might very well be that you lose interest immediately simply because you don't have an active profile and yes i know a social presence is not something you can just churn out it takes a long time to build up which is also why you should get started today so if you got intrigued here go and watch my other video where you can learn how i created and launched my first ebook in this video i also break down some other highly effective distribution channels including email marketing subscribe to my channel for more i will see you soon for another video
