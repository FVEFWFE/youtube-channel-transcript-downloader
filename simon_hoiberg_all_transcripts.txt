TITLE: I'm tired...

================================================================================

I'm tired. I'm tired of handing over almost half of my revenue to Meta and Google cuz this is the reality of the business I'm running. I'm heavily dependent on running ads. And of course, it cost money to make money. I completely understand that. But the truth is things have changed. I remember back in 2022, almost 4 years ago now. At this time, VHive, my first startup, was still very new and it was slowly starting to pick up, but I had exhausted the reach I could get from my back then relatively small audience on Twitter. And this was when I discovered how powerful ads can be. Back then, no one was really talking about running ads. But I realized that a good piece of content mostly also works as a good ad creative that can be used to drive sales. So, I started repurposing some of my best viral Twitter posts related to the software I'm selling and ran them as ads on Facebook and it worked really well. At the same time, my YouTube channel was starting to pick up too. But instead of using every opportunity to promote my products in my YouTube videos, I figured why don't I just retarget my own viewers with video ads. then I can focus on sharing value in my videos and when I later hit people with an ad, I will already be a familiar face. And this worked phenomenally. The combination of Facebook and YouTube video ads made FeedHive take off hard in the beginning of 2023, going from around 10,000 MR to 60,000 MR in just that year. At the peak, I would spend 30 to $40,000 per month just on running ads and adding MR. But in 2024, reality hit. My ads just weren't converting that well anymore. Even though I tried to stay on top of the latest trends, recreate the formats, trying UGC ads, and so on and so on, the rorowass, the return on ad spend just kept going down. And in 2025, the whole thing became very clear. Two major movements massively disrupted the performance of her ads. One, YouTube Premium. YouTube dialed up the frequency of inv video ads on their platform to the point it became unbearable and at the same time they were promoting YouTube Premium their adfree experience pretty heavily. So everyone I knew myself included upgraded to YouTube Premium to get rid of the ads and as a result the only people left to see the ads on YouTube would be people with no money essentially. and it was very easy to see my YouTube video ads almost entirely stopped converting two AI slop. Now, I actually don't use Facebook a lot. I only log in to see how my ads perform. But when I do log in, I realize that the feed is now completely infested with AI slop. And I mean, not just AI generated content, but the sloppiest of slop. It's worse on Facebook than on any other platform. And I have a strong feeling that this is just pushing normal people off the platform. Our Facebook ads still perform, but not nearly as well as they used to. And you know what? [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] it. I'm tired of giving these giant tech companies my money. Instead, I would much rather give them to you and help you get your first business going in 2026 or help you add another income stream to your portfolio. So, that's why I'm launching something new. Founder Stack Partners. If you've been watching my videos, you probably already know this, but I bundled my entire SAS portfolio, including FeedHive and four other tools, into one giant stack called Founder Stack. And we're selling access to this stack as a lifetime deal. That means you pay $1,299 once and then you own access to all of our tools forever. And with Foundersstack partners, we are now offering 25% commission if you can bring in a sale. Here's how it works. You go to partners.foundersstack.pro. You sign up for an account and you get a unique partner link. Share this link with your audience, your newsletter readers, your own YouTube viewers, whatever it might be. And for each sale, we will give you 25%. So, for example, you generate 10 sales a month. You earn 25% commission on those sales. We pay you $3,247. Or let's say you generate one sale a day. With 25% commission, that would be $10,67 per month. We have a handful of early partners doing really well on this program already. What we can see on the back end is that on average it requires 600 to 800 visitors to generate one sale. So this does require a bit of traffic, but if you sit on a source that can generate this type of traffic, this is an excellent opportunity. So I'm not going to stop running ads entirely, but honestly, I would much rather move that budget to you. I would rather pay a real human $300 for a genuine recommendation than burn through thousands of dollars just to feed an algorithm that gives me less and less in return. We're keeping the money in the community instead of handing it over to big tech. To me, that is just a much better business model. The system is ready. 25% commission is set. Now, the rest is up to you. Go to partners.founderstack.pro, Pro. Sign up, get your link, and let's see if we can beat the algorithm together. Thank you.

TITLE: 5 OS SaaS ideas to launch in 2026

================================================================================

There's a new movement happening in SAS and it's not AI. Founders are waking up. We're realizing that the convenience of big tech has come at the cost of our margins and our control. So, we're seeing a massive migration from the cloud back to bare metal infrastructure and open-source software. [music] So, instead of fighting over users in the AI space, there is now a big opportunity to capitalize on this movement. And in this video, I want to cover five SAS ideas in this space. I believe could be huge. If you're new to this channel, welcome here. I'm Simon Horberg and I run a SAS portfolio of five SAS tools. And if you're wondering why I'm here handing out SAS ideas for free instead of just building them myself, it's because I am. My SAS portfolio founder stack contains five SAS tools already. And because I work with SAS every single day, I get a ton of ideas I believe could have amazing potential. But obviously, I cannot build them all. So instead of keeping them to myself, I'd much rather talk about them here. So maybe you can take one of these ideas and [music] run with it. So without further ado, let's get to it. The first idea is an open-source affiliate marketing tool. Now, this one actually comes from a very real personal pain point. We recently launched the partner program for Founder Stack. And naturally, we needed a tool to handle affiliate links, tracking, and payouts. So, I tried a bunch of the most well-known tools on the market. And don't get me wrong, they're great tools, but they all had one major requirement that had me think again. [music] In order for these tools to work, you have to connect them to your Stripe account. You have to give them read access to your revenue, your customer emails, and your transaction history. [music] And honestly, I just wasn't comfortable with that. sharing that level of sensitive financial data with a third party tool just to track some clicks just didn't feel right. So instead, we decided to vibe code our own solution. It took us about a week and we now have a fully custom partner platform running on our own infrastructure. But it got me realizing something. If there had been a solid open-source affiliate tool that I could have self-hosted on my own server, I would have picked that in a heartbeat. And I think this is a massive opportunity for 2026. [music] First of all, it solves the privacy issue. You keep your Stripe keys and your customer data on your own database. No third party ever gets access to any of your sensitive data. And secondly, it solves transparency. A huge [music] issue with affiliate programs is trust. Are partners actually getting the payouts they've earned? And is the attribution logic fair? With an open source platform, this code would be public. [music] Your partners can inspect the logic and confirm that you are being honest with sales attribution. [music] That builds a level of trust that a blackbox says simply can't match. [music] Now, if I were to build this as a business today, I would structure the monetization in three [music] layers. One, a free community edition, fully open source. Anyone can fork it and host it. [music] This gets you distribution and makes it the standard. Two, a pro lifetime [music] license. you sell a supporter edition that comes with advanced features, maybe multi- teamam support or advanced analytics for a onetime fee. And [music] three, and this is the big one, a full done for you service. This would be the equivalent of a merchant of record, but specifically [music] for affiliate payouts. You offer service where you handle the tax compliance and the actual money transfer to the affiliates while a software runs on their server. I really think the market is begging for a solution like this. The second idea is an agentic QA tester. So, not long ago, I saw this tweet and it sparked [music] quite a bit of debate. But I'll be completely honest with you, I don't look at all the code the AI is generating anymore either. [music] In fact, I stopped asking the AI to refactor or optimize for human readability because I figured it's most likely an AI that will be reading and maintaining that code in the future anyway. Instead, I simply do manual QA on the solution that the AI built to see if everything still works. Though, I've noticed one thing. Having an AI go over another AI's work, sometimes even multiple times, drastically increases the quality of the code. So, why wouldn't this principle apply to the QA part, too? Imagine a tool where instead of writing all these comprehensive Cyprus or Playright tests that break [music] every time you change a tiny little thing, you just give the AI a mission. Go to the pricing page, select the pro plan, and make sure the checkout flow works. This agent would spin up a headless browser, look at the screen using computer vision, [music] and click through the application exactly like a human would. It solves the biggest [music] pain in testing, which is maintenance. You get the reliability of end-to-end testing without the nightmare of constantly keeping your testing logic up to date. Now, how do you monetize this? Well, this is the perfect candidate for a usage-based [music] pricing model. You are selling a junior QA engineer. So, you charge per test run or per agent minute or maybe just AI credits and then let the user top up. You could also offer a higher tier enterprise plan where the agent runs inside their own VPC. So unreleased products never touch your cloud. This is a massive compliance requirement for big tech and some companies will pay a premium for that privacy. Idea number three is what I call a shadow database tool. We all use these amazing no code tools to run our businesses. We use tools for our project management, for our CRM, and for our internal vickies. And the user experiences of these commercial products like Notion and Air Table are incredible. They are miles ahead of most open- source alternatives and certainly way ahead of anything we could ever build ourselves. But they all come with one massive downside. They own your data. If one of these platforms decide to double their pricing or if they decide to change their terms or worst case, if they decide to ban your [music] account, you are completely locked out. your business data is trapped inside their proprietary data stores. [music] This is the classic vendor lock trap. So the idea here is to build a data liberation engine. Think of it as a sync tool [music] that connects to the APIs of these SAS platforms and pulls your data in real time into a standard [music] raw Postgress database that you host on your server. Now you can still use the SAS product exactly as you do today. You're not replacing it, but you are creating a live readonly mirror of every single piece of data you create. It's effectively a data insurance against vendor lock. If the SAS provider ever becomes a problem or if they shut down, you don't just have a messy export dump. You have a structured SQL database with all your customers tasks and notes ready to be plugged into a new tool. This product would then have a bunch of different connectors to other popular platforms. So [music] if you were to move from notion to Monday, you would simply click a button and this tool would normalize your data from notion and then import it into Monday automatically. In terms of monetization, I would follow the open core model here. The core sync engine is free and open source. This gets you the trust of the developer community because they [music] can inspect the code and see that you aren't stealing anyone's data. But then you monetize on the connectors. Maybe the connectors for tools like notion or air table is free, but the connectors to Salesforce, SAP [music] or Oracle, the enterprise connectors requires a paid license. And of course, you can offer a managed cloud version where you host the shadow database for them for a monthly subscription. That's a very proven, very scalable business model. SAS idea number four is a self-hosted AI media studio. Right now, if you want to generate highquality AI images or videos, you generally have two options. You can go to platforms like Midjourney or Runway. These are completely closed ecosystems running their own proprietary models. Or you can use aggregators like Open Art. Now, Open Art is great because it lets you use and combine different models in one place. But their business model is based on credits. Essentially, they are reselling you the compute, but with a markup. You pay a subscription, you get a balance, and when it runs out, you pay again. But if we look [music] at the textbased AI world, we have this incredible tool called typing mic. If you haven't seen it, it's a beautiful UI that let you chat with GBT5, cla or Gemini. But instead of paying a monthly subscription for credits, you simply buy a one-time license for the software and then you plug in your own API key. This means you are paying wholesale prices for the AI inference directly to the provider. No markup, no middleman. We need this exact same model, but for AI video and images. The idea is to build a self-hostable UI that sits on top of AI pass providers like Replicate or Fell AI. It would be a studio tool that let you chain together the most popular models like [music] Flux or Nano Banana for images or cling or Pixieverse or Sora for video. You wouldn't be selling credits. You wouldn't be selling compute. You are simply selling the interface. The user brings their own API key from replicate. They pay replicate directly for the generation. You just provide an awesome UI workflow builder to combine these models. And in terms of monetization, this is a perfect [music] candidate for the lifetime license model. Just like typing mine, you sell the software for a onetime fee. For instance, $79 or $99. Since you don't have any server cost because the user connects directly to the AI provider, your recurring cost is effectively zero. It's pure software play. You build it once, you update it occasionally, and you sell the license forever. This is exactly the kind of low overhead, high margin business that is perfect for a solo founder in 2026. The last idea is unfortunately a bit more serious. One of my favorite YouTubers, Pat Walls from Starter Story, recently had a terrible experience with YouTube. Out of nowhere, his content started getting flagged [music] as dangerous. And he started receiving strikes on his channel. And as you know, after three strikes, YouTube doesn't just suspend you, they may delete your entire channel. Years of work gone overnight. He talked about this on Twitter. And as it turns out, it wasn't just him. This started happening to a bunch of business YouTubers seemingly due to some AI moderation error. Now, fortunately, I haven't experienced any of this myself, but seeing that happen to the starter story channel made me incredibly uncomfortable, and it is a harsh reminder that we cannot really rely on big tech for our businesses. We are building our houses on rented land. So, the idea is to build a self-hostable YouTube clone. I'm talking about a platform you can spin up on your own server that functions exactly like [music] YouTube. It handles the video hosting, the streaming, the quality adjustments, and it has a full UI for likes, [music] comments, and related video suggestions, and so on. Now, to be clear, this obviously cannot replace YouTube as a platform and the network. But it's a place where your viewers can go and watch your content if the unthinkable happens. [music] Place where you own the platform, you own the database of comments, and you own the subscribe button. In terms of monetization, this is the perfect creator economy tool. You could release the community edition for free, which just handles video hosting, perfect for personal archives or small channels, but then you could monetize by selling membership features as a paid license. This would allow creators to turn their self-hosted platform into their own version of Patreon or YouTube Premium. They can put their videos behind a payw wall, [music] connect their own Stripe account, and keep 100% of the revenue from their biggest fans. In 2026, creators are waking up to the platform risk. [music] Selling them the ultimate backup plan is, in my opinion, a very powerful value proposition. [music] Now, as you know, these are just ideas. They are completely worthless if you don't execute. And if you feel the analysis paralysis kicking in already, let me [music] help you out. Cuz in this video, I'm showing you how to build a niche AI SAS with lovable and replicate step by step. So take one of these ideas, go watch this video next, and then go build yourself a SAS.

================================================================================

We spend so much time optimizing for all the things that drive more revenue, sales, features, launch campaigns, promotions, but we almost never optimize for the one metric that actually keeps the company alive. The joy of running your business. One of the worst things I can imagine is doing a 9 to-ive job I hate. But what if you end up hating the job you created for yourself? With all the new AI tools that allow us to do more, we might feel obligated to constantly do more and it's a recipe for disaster. So, in this video, I want to share three specific systems I've used while building my business. Systems that will keep you out of the chaotic hustle till you drop mentality and allow you to actually make money while you enjoy life. The first system is what I call the 50 3020 rule. Imagine you have three buckets. Every single activity you do in your business goes into one of these. The smallest bucket is what I call the suck bucket. This is for work that frankly sucks. It's draining. It's boring and it's tedious. Taxes, legal compliance, fixing server crashes or dealing with angry customers. It sucks, but it's highly needlemoving. It must be done to keep the business alive. Then we have the middle bucket, the joy bucket. This is for work that feels like play. It energizes you. It brings you excitement, but it's not necessarily important. It might even be a waste of time from a purely business perspective. And finally, the big bucket, the magic bucket. This is the combination of the two. This is work that you find meaningful and fun, but at the same time has a massive impact on your business. Now, look at the sizes of these buckets. This is the ratio you need to aim for. At most 20% of your work should be in the suck bucket. At most 30% of your work should be in the joy bucket. And at least 50% of your work must be in the magic bucket. And this is where I see so many founders going wrong. They listen to the hustle gurus who tell them it's all about discipline and suffering. So they turn their entire business into one giant suck bucket. They optimize for revenue but optimize for misery. On the other hand, you have the indie hackers who just want to build cool stuff. They try to make their business one huge joy bucket. They code all day, refuse to do marketing, and they never get anywhere because they're essentially just running a hobby. The key to a company you love running is to hitting this specific ratio. And I know this is easier said than done. First, you have to accept that you need to get out of your comfort zone. I know so many technical founders who struggle to get over themselves and do sales and marketing. For them, writing code is fun. Marketing goes straight into the suck bucket. But you have to do it. There's no way around it. But at the same time, and this is the part people forget, you must allow yourself to waste time. I still script, film, and edit all of my YouTube videos myself. I can't count how many business experts have told me that I need to outsource this. You should be working on your business, not in your business, Simon. Maybe, but I'm having a great time. It goes into my joy bucket. And that joy provides the fuel I need to handle the boring stuff. But most importantly, you need to figure out what goes into that 50% magic bucket. Because if you cannot fill 50% of your week with work that is both profitable and enjoyable, that is a symptom that you don't have a business. Either you have a fun hobby that makes no money, or you have a business, but it's really a job you're going to end up hating. So, once you've categorized your activities, the next question is, how do you actually schedule them so that the things you enjoy stay enjoyable? The second system is the four-week rotation schedule. I created this system because I see almost every founder falling into one of two specific traps. The first trap is the contact switcher. This is the founder who tries to be the CEO, CTO, CMO, and support lead every single day. They write code in the morning, answer tickets at lunch, and try to write social media post in the evening. And the result of that is that they're constantly shallow. They write buggy code because they're distracted and generic marketing copy because their brain is still in debug mode. But then there's the second trap, and this is the one that's even more dangerous. It's the comfort worker. This is the founder who takes one specific activity, usually building the product, and just stays there. They treat their business like it's the 100% joy bucket. They keep adding features, telling themselves that they will do marketing next week or once the product is perfect, but next week never comes. They hide in their comfort zone while their business slowly dies. And I had this issue too. I was the context switcher and it became a huge issue. So, I came up with this idea of themed weeks, which I now call the four-week rotation schedule. This solves both of these problems. It stops the context switcher from drowning in noise, and it forces the comfort worker to actually step out of the code editor and do the work that grows the business. So, here's how I split my month. Week one is build week. This is deep work. I put my headphones on, I close social media, and I build. The goal here is to ship features. I'm the CTO. I'm not trying to sell anything. I'm just making the product better. Week two is marketing week. Total shift of energy. I take the developer hat off and I put the marketer hat on because I know I can focus entirely on this for a whole week. I can actually go deep and do it properly instead of treating it like something I just have to finish so I can get back to building. Week three is ops week. This is where we tackle the sock bucket. We automate, we document, and we streamline operations. If I found myself doing a repetitive task in the previous two weeks, this is the week I set up workflows to automate it. And finally, week four is Slack week. This is where you relax, recharge, and let your mind wander. And I know the hustle cultural reaction to this is you can't take a week off every single month. That's lazy. But it isn't about being lazy. It's actually quite strategic. The best ideas for your business never come when you're staring at the code editor trying to get views on social media. They come when you're walking in nature, when you're having casual conversations with your spouse, or when you're reading something in a new book. You need space to think. And Slack week is the only time you get to step out of the loop and ask yourself, is this even the right direction? Now, obviously, this is a framework, not a law of physics. If a critical server crashes during marketing week, I'm not going to ignore it. And if a huge social media opportunity drops during build week, I'll take it. But this schedule is my default state. It protects me from the chaos of doing everything at once. And it forces me to do the important things I might otherwise avoid. But even with the perfect bucket ratio and a perfect schedule, things will eventually go wrong. You will lose a big customer. You will ship a bug that deletes data. You will get a hate comment that ruins your morning. And when that happens, no amount of scheduling will save you. You need a protocol for handling the emotional hit. This brings us to the final rule. It's less of a business framework and more of a rule of life. It's the 45se secondond rule. I learned this back when I was working in sales. Sometimes we would spend weeks warming up a lead, doing demos, negotiating terms, and then at the very last minute the deal would fall through. It was tremendously demoralizing. But because we had a strict quota to hit, we didn't have time to sulk. So we had a rule. You get 45 seconds. Start the watch for 45 seconds. You are allowed to be fully frustrated. You can be angry. You can feel sorry for yourself. You can curse the client. Let it all out. But when the time is up, you move on. You pick up the phone and you call the next prospect. Because here's the truth. If you carry that negativity and grudge into the next call, you're going to ruin that sale, too. And I still carry this rule with me today. Now, it's not always exactly 45 seconds. Sometimes it's 5 minutes. Sometimes it's an hour. Sometimes it's even longer. But the agreement I make with myself is the same. I set a timer for how long I'm allowed to stay pissy over whatever happened. And when the timer hits zero, I force myself to let it go. Because if you let a bad morning turn into a bad week, you will never see the end of it. I know this is quite different from the traditional business guru talk you get on YouTube, but I hope you're open to give some of these approaches a try. Which one of these resonated with you the most? Please let me know in the comments. You know, YouTube is constantly evolving, and I try my best to align the videos I create with what I believe will create the most value for you. So, if you enjoy these more low-key, less hype kind of videos from me, please give it a like and subscribe to the channel if you haven't already. I hope this will help you build a business you love. I will see you around.

TITLE: Can you ACTUALLY replace your team with AI? (Real talk)
VIDEO ID: EdeWN3whbgw
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdeWN3whbgw
================================================================================

A recent study from MIT came out and it reveals a brutal reality. 95% of AI initiatives fail to deliver any measurable value. That means only 5% of companies are actually succeeding in replacing human work with AI. So why is everyone hyping this idea that we can replace human work with AI? See, this made me curious cuz I'm one of the few who actually made it work. Over the last year, I reduced my own team from 11 people down to just three. And I replaced their work with AI. And while doing that, revenue went up, our output increased, and margins got better. So, I have to take some blame here cuz I'm one of the people who have been hyping this idea. I have published several videos showing you how to build AI agents, social media content writers, SEO blog writers, and AI support systems. I am actively contributing to this hype. But what I've realized is that replacing your team with AI seems to only work for a very specific type of company run by a very specific type of business owner. And if that's not you, making this move might be a terrible idea. So in this video, I want to take you through three checkpoints. These are filters that will help you answer the question, should I replace my team with AI? and if so, which team members should go first? If you're new to this channel, welcome here. I'm Simon Horberg and my team and I run a SAS portfolio of 5 SAS products. We used to be a small team, but now we're an even smaller team thanks to AI and automation. So, the first checkpoint is all about the DNA of your company. Is your business humanentric or process centric? A human ccentric business is run by people for people. The focus here is on culture, collaboration, and goal alignment. It's the type of company where you want every team member to feel heard. You have a flat structure. You involve everyone in key decision-making, and you spend a lot of time ensuring everyone is motivated and personally aligned with the company mission. Think of a creative agency, a hightouch consultancy, or typical startups where culture fit is just as important as the actual skills. In these environments, the value often comes from the friction and the chaos of human collaboration. If you try to replace this team with AI, you will rip the soul out of your company. AI doesn't care about your mission. It doesn't need to feel heard and it's terrible at nuanced cultural decision-m. On the other hand, we have the process ccentric business. This is a business that runs like a machine. It relies on vicks, guidelines, SOPs, and checklists. Here a team member is assigned a specific task with clearly defined requirements, a deadline and a set of dependencies. Decisions are made at the top by the business owner and the team is there to execute. My business has always been heavily processentric. Even before AI, the biggest selling point I had when hiring was we have no meetings, we have no ceremonies, you can work whenever you want as long as stuff gets done. But the flip side of that is we never really had much culture. I rarely involved the team in big strategic decisions and honestly I didn't require them to be passionate about the vision of the company. My team would care only to the extent they needed to understand the context of their work. And this is one of the reasons I was able to transition to AI so successfully because an AI agent loves a processcentric environment. It loves clear instructions. It loves SOPs. It loves checklists. It doesn't need a pep talk and it doesn't need a zoom meeting to feel included. So look at your business. Are you running a human- ccentric or a process centric company cuz if you are running a high culture human first organization you cannot replace your team. You can augment them but you cannot replace them. If you're running a processcentric company on the other hand you are in a much better position. Let's move on to checkpoint number two. This checkpoint is all about you, the founder. Are you a leader or are you an operator? We're often told that to be a successful CEO, you have to be a great leader. You have to be the person who rallies the troop. The one with the high empathy who makes everyone feel heard, resolve conflicts, and motivates the team to go above and beyond. Think of people like Steven Bartlett, Dan Martell, or Gary Vaynerchuk. These are incredible leaders. Their superpowers are empathy, communication, and culture building. But the idea that you have to be a great leader in order to run a company is not true because on the other side of the spectrum, you have the operator. This is the executive who gets things done. They are obsessed with systems, data, and logic. They are big on systems thinking and often, let's be honest, a little low on soft skills. The ultimate example I can think of is Elon Musk. If you listen to anyone who's worked close to him, they aren't exactly describing him as a great leader, but he is probably the world's best operator. He cares about the physics of the problem, the efficiency of the line, and the output of the system. In fact, usually a great operator is not a great leader and vice versa. This is why natural leaders often hire COOs or project managers to handle the systems and why natural operators often hire team leads to handle the people. And this part requires a bit of self-awareness and introspection. I'll admit I was never a natural-born leader. I consider myself a strong operator. I love building systems. I love optimizing workflows. But I've never enjoyed the people management side of things. the motivation, the conflict resolution, the emotional alignment, all of this. And generally operators like me end up running process-centric businesses while leaders end up running human-centric businesses. And this is the key. If you are an operator, AI is your dream employee. Because AI doesn't need empathy. It needs logic. It doesn't need motivation. It needs instructions. If you're a natural leader who thrives on personal connection, you will struggle to manage an AI workforce because you cannot motivate an AI. You cannot inspire an AI with a vision. You cannot take an AI out for a onetoone to resolve a conflict. So look at these last two checkpoints. If you're a leader running a human-centric business, you can stop watching right now. You should not try to replace your workforce with AI. In fact, you should go watch other videos on leadership and how to become an even better leader cuz that's where the true ROI is for you. But if you're an operator running a processcentric business, you are in the perfect position to replace your team with AI. But even if you have the right business and the right personality, you still can't just fire everyone randomly. You need to know exactly which roles to replace. So let's say you're running a processcentric business and you are an operator at heart. Does that mean you can just fire your whole team tomorrow? No, absolutely not. Because even inside a perfect system, there are certain roles that AI simply cannot touch yet. To figure out which roles you can replace and which ones you need to keep, I use a framework I call the RIP model. Honestly, no pun intended. That is what I call this framework. R stands for repetitive. This is the lowhanging fruit. Is the task identical every single time? Copying data from an email to a spreadsheet, formatting a monthly report, categorizing support tickets. If a human is doing this effectively like a robot, an actual robot will do it better, faster, and cheaper. The P stands for predictable. Is there a clear right or wrong answer? Write an SQL query that pulls active users from the database. There is a correct way to do that. But reply to our biggest enterprise client who is threatening to turn because of a server outage. This is not predictable. AI can write a polite apology, but it can't read the room. It doesn't know the specific client, and it doesn't know that he needs an honest phone call to be saved. AI thrives on formulas. It fails on nuance. But here's the real trap. Most founders do get the R and the P right, but they completely ignore I. I stands for isolated, and this is where 90% of AI implementations fail. Can the task be done in a vacuum or does it require tribal knowledge? I use AI to write code every single day. And AI is incredible at writing clean, highquality code. But AI assumes that your code base makes sense, which let's be honest, most code bases don't. That's why it will randomly refactor code, remove old functions, or delete an unused table in your database. It doesn't know that you have a random Zapier automation set up 2 years ago that reads that specific table in order to run your payroll. This is context. It is tribal knowledge. And AI is terrible at this. It doesn't know the history of your company. It doesn't know the invisible dependencies and it doesn't know why you made a weird decision several years ago. If a task requires deep integration with other moving parts of the business or deep historical context, it's not isolated. And if you try to replace that role with AI, the AI won't just fail. It will probably break things and make a big mess. You can only give AI a task that requires no prior knowledge about a specific thing or where that knowledge can be included in brief terms upon solving the task. So here's the rule. If a role handles tasks that are repetitive, predictable, and isolated, you can replace it today. If it misses even one of these, you have to at the very least loop in a human as a part of that workflow. So instead of thinking about replacing people, think about replacing tasks and apply the RIP model to figure out which ones. This is how you build a system. And this brings us right back to the brutal statistic from MIT. The reason 95% of companies fail to get value from AI is not because the technology isn't ready. It's because they are treating AI like a magic employee that can just figure things out instead of a machine that follows strict instructions. They are trying to replace leadership, tribal knowledge, and strategy with a chatbot. The 5% of us who are actually succeeding, we aren't doing that. We are acting as operators. We are stripping away the repetitive, predictable, isolated tasks and we are handing them over to agents so humans can focus on the things that actually require a pulse. Now understanding the theory is one thing. Actually sitting down and building real AI agents that pass the RIP test is a different story. And if you want to see exactly how that's done step by step, I recorded a full breakdown where I built a news research agent. It creates a perfect isolated workflow that does the work of a human researcher. And you can watch the video right here.

TITLE: How To Survive The "Fast Fashion" Era of SaaS
VIDEO ID: L_tEwaEO4ZA

================================================================================

The SAS market as a whole has become extremely competitive over the last few years. And now with tools like lovable, cursor, and cloud code, we're going to have so so many SAS products for almost everything. I call this the Teeo effect. AI is going to write 95% of the code for a lot of products. It will design the interfaces and do the UX, and it will even debug and quality check its own solutions. Are these products going to be amazing? Probably not. But many people will settle, just like cheap products on Teemo. So, if you want to avoid joining this race to the bottom in the age of AI, it is now more important than ever that you find a way to uniquely position your product in this super crowded market. And in this video, I will give you eight ways you can position your SAS. And I'll give you the pros and cons and some real life examples for each of them. By the end of this video, you should ask yourself, which of these positions is my product taking? And does it make sense to consider changing it? Let's go. Position one, a lowcost alternative. If you are an indie hacker and you're building your products using these AI tools, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, but it might pay off in the long run if you just call it what it is, a lowcost alternative. Let it come through in your messaging and your offer that you have a product that serves a very well-established market in solving a very well-known problem and you're offering to do it at a lower cost than other big players in the market. A great example of this is Papley which is a lowcost sepier alternative. They very openly market themselves this way and it comes with a ton of benefits. They don't have to educate the market. They don't have to convince anyone about the need for their tool. They just need to drop the name sappier and cheaper and the right customers will instantly be aligned with their value prop. This also makes advertising an ideal marketing channel for a tool with this position. On the flip side, you might risk getting the cheap knockoff or AI slop vibe associated with you, which isn't always desirable. Position two, a light version. you have a product that solves a problem in a much simpler way, offering a much more minimalistic and often more limited user interface. For example, Canvas started out as a light version of Photoshop. As Canva grew more complex, one of the tools I'm running, Tiny Kiwi, is now a light version of Canva. A similar example is Mailor Light. It's a light version of tools like Mailchimp and Send Grid. It literally has light in its name. It's a textbook example of a light version position. It's a perfect opportunity to capture users who are less techsavvy and find the alternatives way too complex and overwhelming. On the other hand, tools like these might end up struggling staying light and still evolve. As I mentioned, Canvas started out with this position, but it grew into a rather complex piece of software that a lot of users are actually struggling with now. Position three, enterprise. You solve a huge frequent and painful problem and you have an extra focus on customer service, tailored solutions, manual setup and account management. This is where SAS meets tech enabled service businesses and I think these hybrid software service type businesses are the most likely to survive this Teemo effect in SAS simply because they still heavily depend on humans. Hopspot and Salesforce are great examples of this type of position. The business and infrastructure of these types of services are often extremely complex. On the other hand, this is where real money flows. Hopspot charges more than $3,000 per month for their enterprise solution, and that's actually in the cheaper end. There are enterprise software solutions that charge way more than this. Position four, unique player. You can take this position if you're offering a very unique approach to solving a problem. This is quite hard to retain over time, but it could be that you have access to certain resources or you have specific expertise that allows you to solve something in a way that few other businesses can. A great example of this is Grammarly. For a long time, before the era of AI, they were very unique and one of a kind in the way they helped users improve writing, which made them an industry leader. Another example is Open AI. For the first three or four years, they were really the only ones doing what they did until competition eventually caught up. The downside of this position is that you have to constantly fight for uniqueness. Very few business models and tech products are immune to being copied, so appearing unique might become very challenging over time. Position five, first mover. This is the position every new founder desires. Being the first one to discover a problem and to claim a new market. A great example of this is Slack. The idea of using a chatbased client as a collaboration tool was quite new at the time and having a first mover advantage is definitely beneficial. Even today, while both Discord and Microsoft Teams have greatly outperformed Slack in the number of users, Slack is somehow still considered an industry standard for team collaboration. On the other hand, if you're the first one, you probably have to educate the market, making everyone aware that there's a problem they might not even know they had and that they need a solution for it. This is painfully difficult, and as the first mover, you're probably also going to make all the mistakes that your competitors can learn from without taking the same hit. Position six, niche. You are solving a problem, but you're solving it for a very specific small segment of the market. And your tool is tailored to this very specific type of user. A great example of this is Oberlow, which at its core is an inventory management system, but it is specifically tailored for drop shipping businesses that are using Shopify. For years, Oberllo served this narrow segment of the market until Shopify eventually acquired it and made it a part of Shopify itself. This is one of the best most tried and tested position and as a small indie SAS this is probably the best position you can take. Find a small group of users and build it for them. Don't worry that the other big players also solve the same problem cuz you're customizing your entire platform to be useful for the specific small group of users. On the flip side, it might limit your growth potential. some point you may have to expand your tool in order to capture a bigger market and this might alienate your original core group of users. Position seven, privacy first. This is a popular position in our day and age where privacy is a topic that concerns a lot of users. You can solve a problem but specifically position yourself as prioritizing data privacy and security above all else. A great example of this is BAM Analytics which brands itself as a simple privacy first alternative to Google Analytics and it's very popular. Another example is NADN which markets their self-hosted version as a way to protect your data by deploying on prem. The downside is that you might end up locking yourself in on a market segment that's too small and as privacy concern grows bigger alternatives might incorporate some of the same privacy practices and end up out competing you that way. And finally, position eight, integrations. You can position yourself as the tool with the largest number of third-party integrations with other tools. For some users, that's simply the final drop that will win them over. A great example of this is Sappure, which boasts of having 6,000 integrations more than their competitors like make and if this then that. And for tools where integrations are a central part of the service they offer, this is obviously a beneficial position to take. The downside, well, your competitors can catch up on you and offer the same integrations. It's a position that's a bit hard to protect. Of course, these are eight popular SAS positions, but they're not the only ones. And as the markets evolve, new positions turn up all the time. One position we're seeing right now that's very unique to the big AI players is the position of who can burn most cash by offering most AI requests for a fixed monthly fee. If you haven't thought about which position your SAS should take, this is a perfect time to do a bit of reflection. Where do you see yourself and your product fit in? And how do you stand out? Positioning is hard and there are certain types of products that are going to make everything much harder. There are AI SAS products that I would completely avoid building to begin with and I explain what they are in this video. So, I will see you over there.

TITLE: 5 Tempting AI SaaS Ideas I’d NEVER Build (here’s why)
VIDEO ID: 0Axx_BWuxsU
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Axx_BWuxsU
================================================================================

Some AI SAS ideas seem so cool and so obvious and easy to build that it almost feels seductive. When you were playing around with the latest releases of the most powerful AI models or you tried creating your first AI automation workflow, your mind was blown. You got the perfect idea for an AI SAS you could build. And maybe it felt crystal clear to you how you would build it and how you would take it to market. But be careful. Some of these ideas seem deceptively obvious, but in reality, they are ideas that with overwhelming certainty will set you up for a massive failure. I get DMs from people pitching me their SAS ideas all the time. And there are five AI SAS ideas I see over and over. They are ideas that I would avoid at all costs. And in this video, we'll break it down. If you're new to this channel, welcome here. I'm Simon Horberg and I run a portfolio of AI SAS products to handle social media, link tracking, customer support, and graphics design. My team and I brainstorm, prototype, and test various new SAS ideas every year. And whenever we see a new idea falling into a category that comes too close to these five AI SAS we're about to discuss, we reject them immediately. And I believe you should do the same. The first AI SAS I would stay far away from is AI copywriters and the reason is simple. The market is flooded with them already. Since GPG3 launched back in 2022, we are now seeing the low barrier to entry really play out here. Some of the first movers like Copy AI and pepper type really made it big here. But at this point, the market is super saturated. It's very easy to spin up a new AI copywriter, and if all you do is wrap OpenAI's API, your tool will do basically the same as all others. It might look like a low-hanging fruit, and it certainly takes very little effort to get up and running, but in my opinion, it will be incredibly hard to stand out if you go down this path. The result is a race to the bottom on pricing, and it's probably one of the markets with the highest turn rates out there. Also, I've noticed this thing. I've seen several big influencers, especially on LinkedIn, who now all ship the same AI copywriters, and frankly, I think it's starting to look a little bit silly. It seems to be a bit of a playbook these guys are all doing now, and it just smells a little bit like a cash grab. Of course, I'm not the one to judge, and maybe I just don't see what's going on behind the scenes, but I fail to see how these copywriters provide something that any standard LLM like Chat GBT or Gemini don't already provide. I think an AI copywriter is a great feature in a bigger product. Like, we have an excellent AI copywriter in FeedHive, which is a social media management tool my team and I run. But it is just one out of many features that make up an AI powered marketing tool. As a standalone product, I'd stay far away. Next one on the list is AI coding tools. You know, tools similar to cursor and wind surf. I would stay far away from this market as a bootstrap founder. And now you're probably thinking, wait a minute, those tools are AI powered and they have product market fit and they're very successful. Yes, you're right. But there's one very important thing we need to consider about these tools. A huge part of what makes cursor so attractive isn't necessarily how it codes, but how much it offers at a rather cheap price. If you take a look at a tool like client, which is an open-source VS Code extension where you bring your own API key, and compare what you get for your money on cursor, you will quickly realize that the average cursor user is very likely losing money for cursor. One of the most significant challenges in building anything with AI is the way LLM API providers structure their pricing. The cost is directly proportional to the consumption of the tool. Meaning the more users interact with your app, the higher your expenses climb. So a successful active user base, which normally should be a cause of celebration for a bootstrap company, suddenly becomes a pretty hectic financial liability. And if your product is aggressively consuming AI, you will have a business model that bleeds cash as the business grows. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, but we just have to remember that tools like Cursor is heavily backed by top tier investment funds. They have substantial financial backing, allowing them to absorb these extreme operational losses as a trade-off to get to market dominance. That's their game. It's a classical VC hyperrowth startup. And as a bootstrap founder, that's who you're competing with. It's not really about building the best product. It's about who can afford bleeding the most cash. And I would stay far away. All right. Third AI SAS I wouldn't touch is AI therapists. So at first glance, the idea of having an AI based therapist might sound like a cool idea. Like having a portable ondemand therapist right in your pocket. The value prop is pretty obvious. And there's actually a lot of data showing that many people now use chat GBT as a therapistlike chatbot to give insights and offer emotional support. But in reality, this idea is a complete ethical shitow. There are countless ways this could go horribly wrong, and I'd like to highlight just a few. Back in March 2023, a man from Belgium ended his life. In the weeks leading up to his death, he'd been talking to this highly advanced AI chatbot called Eliza on the Chai app. And according to the man's wife, the chatbot encouraged the man to end himself by convincing him that he could save the planet by sacrificing himself. Another recent example is from the National Eating Disorders Association in the US. In 2023, they had to take down their AI chatbot, Tessa, which was giving users with eating disorders harmful suggestions such as restricting calories and losing weight. Literally, the whole purpose of the chatbot was to do the exact opposite of that. And of course, I don't think that we can necessarily say that these chat bots are the cause of these bad things happening. These people may have suffered from trauma, depression, or psychosis before entering the chat. And by the end of the day, it's the person's choice to act on the advice they're given. However, if your AI therapist somehow got into the middle of a case like this, it's just way, way too much to handle if you're a small bootstrap founder or an indie hacker. I remember Peter Levelvels, who is one of the most well-known and wellrespected indie hackers, started working on an AI therapist too, but quickly wrapped up the project due to push back from his audience, which I absolutely believe was the right choice. Stick to products that are much more non-critical by nature. Anything that has to do with people's health, both physically and mentally, I would stay far away from. The next one on the list is AI detectors. The sales pitch is pretty simple. before you publish a piece of content that was written by AI, you should run it through a detector so it can detect the parts that look like AI. And then you can tweak that manually and Google won't know that you used AI. Or even better, some of the more advanced tools actually do this rewriting for you. So you can kind of cloak your content a little so it doesn't look like it was written by AI. I think tools like these have at least three major flaws. First of all, a tool like this isn't offering a solution to the right problem. Google is very clear about this. The problem is not using AI to write the content. The problem is lowquality, spammy content clearly made to manipulate search rankings. Even if one of these detectors concludes that your content is not written by AI, it might still get deranked because the quality simply isn't high enough. Secondly, AI detector tools like this are basically boiling the cat and mouse game down to a third-party SAS tool. You don't have access to Google's algorithms, and you probably shouldn't build your business by attempting to play a game of cat-and- mouse with Google, where you have to constantly guess how their internal systems work. And finally, tools like these are probably going to make your content much worse. Trying to patch up a piece of content that is already written is a terrible idea. If anything, you should build a tool or a service that aims to write great, highquality content with AI to begin with. Again, Google doesn't mind if AI was used as long as it's good and helpful content. There are a few tools out there doing exactly this already, and I actually have a video where I show you how to build a custom workflow for this in NAN. I'll leave a link in the description below. So, an AI detector tool especially used for SEO is something I would stay away from. The final AI SAS I would avoid is AI summarizers. The thought of having an AI that can read through, digest, and summarize hours of meetings or endless email threads in your inbox does seem like a really useful problem to solve. And the truth is it has been solved many times already. This one kind of goes down the same bucket as AI copywriters, but in a sense, I think this one is even worse. An AI summarizer is no longer a product. It's become a feature. And not just any feature, but an aggressively integrated and completely free feature that now sits natively in all major productivity and platform ecosystems. Anyone using Google Workspaces are getting their emails summarized, covered in one click, natively, and for free. Meetings are automatically summarized, and every Google Meet call generates a meeting recap with key action items. Also, you'd have to overcome an enormous trust barrier in order to get adoption to gain access to every email in the customer's inbox, including sensitive and private emails and every meeting and every employees calendar, including private or internal conversation. It's not just something companies hand over to any small bootstrap company. And I know there's a whole debate around this, but generally speaking, users do trust Google or Microsoft with this data already. Personally, I wouldn't want to compete here. So, these are five AI SAS ideas I would stay far away from. On the other hand, there is this super simple approach to unlocking thousands of potential micros ideas that are worth building. And I don't often hear people talk about this. If you're curious about this approach, go watch this video next. I will see you over there.

TITLE: Someone Will Get Really Rich Doing This

================================================================================

Someone is going to get really rich doing this. You might have noticed how social media got filled with these cool Nad workflows that use AI to solve all kinds of things. I've been sharing my workflows, too, both on LinkedIn and here on YouTube. NAN is an incredible tool and these workflows are truly really helpful. But a lot of people, especially people who don't have technical skills, find these very difficult and complex to use. And I guess the UI of Naden can be a bit intimidating. A lot of people want something more simple, a simple form, click a button, and then you get the results. And this is a massive opportunity cuz YouTube is filled with powerful N workflows that solve real problems for real users, often free to download, free of charge. And if you can slide in between the workflow and the average user and offer access in a more userfriendly way, you'll be in business. And in this video, I'm going to show you three different ways this could be achieved. Ranging from that simple to more challenging, but with bigger potential. Let's go. If you're new to this channel, welcome here. I'm Simon Hornberg and I run a SAS portfolio of AI tools to help you grow your personal brand, handle incoming emails, and support, track link engagement, and much more. We are a fully bootstrapped small team of just four people, myself included. And the reason we can stay this lean is because we know how to use AI and automation to handle most of our operations. If you're not familiar with NADN, it's a popular AI and automation tool similar to Sapier and Make, but much more powerful. And I use this tool heavily to run my startup. The first and easiest approach is to build a super simple and streamlined UI on top of a really good but complex NAN workflow. Here's how it works. Scroll YouTube for NAN workflows. Try to find one that looks really valuable, but also one that looks a bit complex and where you notice many people in the comments struggle to make it work. Then simply download the workflow and get it running on your own NAND account. The best and most scalable option here is if you have it self-hosted, so you can have unlimited workflow runs. Now, NAND allows you to start any workflow using an incoming web hook, which essentially is just an API endpoint. So, you now go and build a simple UI on top of this where users can input only the most crucial things the workflow needs to get started. Some workflows may need a user to log in with Google. Some may need that they upload certain files. But that's it. You stripped away all the complexity and now offer a very simple but very powerful little tool for one specific job. And here's how you could monetize this. If your NAN workflow uses something like Open AI, then you obviously need to pay for the tokens through your own account. Asking users to bring their own API key is again complex for some users, but it also gives you the opportunity to charge users for the AI credits that's being used and of course add a small margin on top. Of course, you could also offer monthly plans to accommodate a certain number of workflow runs per month. Once you find a good workflow, understand it and make it work for yourself. You can use tool like Lovable to describe the use case and quickly create the perfect user-friendly UI to put on top. Now, the second approach is a bit more ambitious, but here we start thinking bigger. Instead of a single use case, you create a collection, go on a spree, and collect super valuable innate workflows while creating really simple user-friendly UIs on top of them. You can start with two or three, but keep iterating. Use YouTube as your source of inspiration and keep adding new workflows to your collection. Call it easyN or something like that. And then ensure that users need to create just a single account to use any app in your collection. And now you can sell subscription plans that covers all apps under your ECN umbrella. And just like before, you could also here offer AI credits and add a margin to make a profit. There's a tool called Run Comfy, and they're doing something very similar. They took an existing open-source tool, Comfy UI, and now they're collecting workflows and provide one-click run in the cloud with a super simple UI on top. These complex comfy UI workflows still run in the background, but the user will see a simplified interface to do a single specific job. I think this is super clever. You could build a small library of reusable UI components for all your workflow forms. Give Lovable access to your repository and simply use Lovable to repeat the process of creating simple userfriendly UIs on top of your workflows. Finally, the last approach is the hardest, but also the one with the biggest potential. With this approach, you zoom out a bit and ask yourself, what exactly is the problem this workflow is solving? What does users achieve by using it? How is their businesses or lives better by using this exact workflow? Find a popular, super comprehensive, and complex workflow and turn the core of that problem into a fullyfledged SAS. Now the scope of this SAS might span much more than what the workflow is offering and you might keep growing the product in the direction of your users's feedback but using the idea behind that one NN workflow as a starting point. You could still use lovable to create a SAS starter but for a tool like this I would move more into custom code maybe assisted by tools like cursor or client and a custom backend and infrastructure on AWS. Use the workflow only as an entry point to kick things off, but replace the steps in the workflow with custom API endpoints you control yourself. Now you have the UI on top. You replaced Naden with your own backend and now you have a fullyfledged SAS product ready to serve. If you follow any of these three steps, you will have a SAS by the end of the year, at least in some form. And who knows, by building one SAS this way, you'll quickly get a better understanding of how to build and run a SAS in general, and it might spark some serious inspiration to do more. I think NAN workflows are a great source of inspiration. They are easy to access, mostly free, and fundamentally they solve a problem. Now, if you want more inspiration like this, take a look at these five real AI agent business ideas you can build in 2025. I will see you over there.

TITLE: How To Build a Content Team of SEO AI Agents (n8n, OpenAI, Aidbase)
VIDEO ID: Bmlkdvg8QgI
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmlkdvg8QgI
================================================================================

I let these AI agents take full control over my blogs. They are now doing research, writing the posts, creating the thumbnails, and publishing daily blogs for my products, Feed Hive, Link Drip, and Abbase. And the results are surprisingly [Music] good, at least for now. Cuz who's going to read all this content? What happens if Google detects that this is AI? Is it worth the risk of deranking your websites forever? I can't tell you if it's worth the risk, but I'll try to inform you to make a rational decision for yourself, and I'll show you how to set up this workflow for yourself in NAN step by step. For a long time, I was living in fear. They're not going to get away with it. In fact, Google has already made it very clear they will fight AI generated content with all they got. Instead, I would focus on a to cuz I heard people say again and again that you should never use AI to generate SEO content. But at the same time, my blogs were dead and I simply didn't have the time to sit and manually write content often enough. I did some research, but Google's policies aren't exactly clear about this. They say they don't penalize content just because it's written by AI, but they do penalize lowquality, unhelpful content created primarily to manipulate search rankings. So, mass-produced, low value AI content clearly fits this description and would be treated as spam. But it also meant that if I could create helpful, highquality, relevant content using AI, I'd be home safe. If I was going to do this, I was going to do it right. I would need careful research, quoting other sources from the internet. I would need unique internal knowledge that couldn't be copied from other places, and I would need custom onbrand thumbnails that would fit with the overall design of my website. After carefully considering the consequences and the pros and cons, I decided to go for it. Let's break it down. Every blog post starts with a topic and a plan for which keywords it should appear under. Having an AI do proper keyword research, find content gaps, and generate real content ideas is challenging, but we do have a few options available. First, we have SER API. This is simply the API version of Google. You'll give it a search term and what you get back is basically page one on Google but in JSON format. This is very useful since you can have an AI agent do a Google search through NAN to see what already shows up under a given keyword. Secondly, we have Perplexity's sonar model. This is an AI search model that will search, retrieve, and synthesize information from the internet. This is super useful to search for real information and facts without having to manually read through a bunch of websites to find what you're looking for. Finally, we have OpenAI's new search model. It's similar to Perplexity Sonar models, but it's currently in preview. Now, I tried a bunch of different approaches to make this work. And what I found is that there are two ways you can start this workflow. You can do all the keyword research manually and give the AI clear and precise instructions on what to write about. If you are an expert SEO and keyword researcher, you probably want to do it like this and accept that the workflow isn't going to be fully autonomous. Or you can do it the way I ended up doing it, and that is by using OpenAI's search model to find content ideas for you based on an overall description of your product and brand. This will give you much less control and most likely a smaller overall chance of ranking well for each post, but at least it will post entirely on its own. Let's set this up. If you don't have an account on NAN already, now is the time to create one. You also need to add your OpenAI credentials here so NAN can connect with your OpenAI account. It's super easy. Simply follow the instructions here. Now create a new workflow and add a schedule trigger. Configure this according to how often you want to publish a new post. Now let's add an AI note. Pick open AAI and pick message a model and let's call it search topic ideas. Let's pick GBT40 search preview from the list of models. The first prompt should be a system prompt and we will give it a basic set of instructions like this. This agent will be writing content for Feed Hive, one of my products. So, make sure to change this description to something that fits your brand. All right, let's test it out. Are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. Awesome. GBT40 search did a great job here. I tried to have an AI agent do actual longtail keyword research from Nadn using various different approaches I found on other YouTube videos, but honestly, it just doesn't really work that well. So, you can either do manual keyword research or you can let GBT40 search go off totally on its own and come up with things. So far, I've had surprisingly good results with doing it this way. Now, let's bring in another AI note again. Message a model. Let's call this one prepare topic. For this one, we can pick GBT40. And also here we want to have a system prompt. This is our content architect. It needs somewhat specific instructions. We also want to describe the exact JSON format it needs to output. This part is very important. And here we want to turn on output content as JSON. Now let's add another prompt which should be a user prompt. Here we want to add the ideas the research AI came up with. and test it. Nice. These agents have now done their job. Let's wrap them in a sticky note to organize them nicely. This first part of the final workflow is almost finished. Now, how do we make sure that these two AI agents will come up with new ideas and not just repeat themselves every day? After all, we don't want to end up cannibalizing on ourselves on the same exact keywords and topics. Also here I tried a few different methods including storing all blog post as vectors in a vector database so the sentiment of new ideas could be compared to previous posts but again sounds fancy but it just doesn't practically work that well. So I ended up simply giving the AI agents access to a simple list of summaries of previous posts. This part highly depends on which system you're using to publish your blog posts. You can use a headless CMS like strappy or prismic. You can use a no code tool like web flow framer or you can commit these directly to a GitHub repository as markdown files if you're hardcore like that. I use strappy. So in my case I will make an API call to strappy using the HTTP request node. This is how you filter blog post entries in strappy but obviously this will be different depending on your setup. There we go. Now let's add this node here before we start researching. And let's just add a few extra instructions to the research agent. Good. And add a user message. We'll just drop all the data from our blog archive like that. And turn it into a JSON string so the chat model can absorb it all. Perfect. This does the job. So far, I haven't caught my two agents producing duplicates. So now we have a description of the topic, a title, a description of an image we want for the thumbnail, and an outline as a list of chapter headlines. We now have everything we need to have AI write the blog post. Or at least that's what I thought. But no matter how many times I tried, these blog posts would come out generic, shallow, boring, and empty. They just wouldn't be worth reading. And most likely these blog posts would be exactly what Google would classify as spam. But then I realized what was missing. There are certain elements that all good blog posts tend to have. Statistics, facts, references. Good blog posts reference other articles and sources on the internet and incorporate them into their post to underline the point they're trying to make. And the best blog post will also have unique insights. They're not just reiterating what other people have already said a thousand times. They bring something new to the table. Insights from their business. There is no way around it. Before moving on to writing the blog post, I needed a special step. This part is critical to make the system work. We need two other AI agents to do additional research before writing the actual post. But instead of researching topic ideas, this agent digs deeper into one specific topic to find interesting facts, statistics, and discoveries that we can use as supporting knowledge and references for a blog post. The other one is an AI with secret access to an internal knowledge base. This is a data archive with private data which might be interesting to include in a relevant blog post. It is data that we are sure no other blogs have access to. This will help keep our blogs unique. So, first we need an AI that can do research. You can use OpenAI's GBT4 search or you can use Perplexity's sonar models. Perplexity now has a sonar deep research model. You can use this if you really need exhaustive research to include in your articles, though it's much more expensive. And for my use case at least, the regular sonar models or GPT4 search will do just fine. To keep this workflow simple, we'll use GPT4 search like we did in the previous step. Let's set this up. So, we'll add another node and again pick OpenAI's messenger model and again find the search preview model. Let's change the first prompt to system and give it a prompt. This part highly depends on your specific needs. Generally, I recommend starting out with something like this and then specify further if needed. Great. Let's also add a user prompt. And here we want to add the title and the description from the previous step. Let's test it. We got the content and all the citations. Now, the next part is where it gets really exciting. We need to prepare our internal knowledge base. We're going to do this with a system called Rag. This allows us to let an AI agent search and retrieve relevant knowledge from our private knowledge base. Nadn supports vector databases such as pine cone, but if you're non techch, it's pretty complex and not very userfriendly. So instead, we're going to use a base and I'll show you just how easy it is to set up a rag. Go to 8base.ai and sign up for a free trial. You want to pick the pro plan since we need API access. If you think $99 per month sounds expensive, don't worry. I'll show you how to get around this in a moment. Now that we have the account ready, go to sources. Here we can add our knowledge sources. We can add our website. Since my blog is for my product FeedHive, I'll add FeedHive's main website and FeedHive's help desk website here. If there are pages on your website you don't want to include, you can go here and exclude them. We also have a bunch of these university videos on our YouTube channel. So, I'll add those two. There we go. Now, I'll select them all and click train AI models. This is going to take a few minutes. Now let's go to the FAQs page and create a new FAQ. This is really really cool cuz it allows me to manage knowledge directly in a base. So here I can start adding questions like this. And you can expand this with all interesting internal facts you have about your business which might be interesting to include in a blog post. And if we go back to the FAQs, then we can train this entire FAQ Awesome. Now we have AI models with direct knowledge from our knowledge base. Let's create a new chatbot with Abbase. A chatbot comes with a chatbot UI. You can use this to embed the chatbot directly on a website. However, in our case, we can ignore all of this since we will use a base API to talk to this chatbot directly. So all we have to do is go to knowledge and add the knowledge we just trained. So this specific chatbot can use it. Now if we go to settings, we see the chatbot ID here. Note this down cuz we'll be using this in a moment. Let's go to settings, click API keys, and create a new API key. Let's grab this API key and head back over to NAD. From the dashboard, click create credentials. Choose header off and in name write authorization and in value enter bearer space and then paste the API key. Now, back in the workflow, let's add an AI agent node. Let's add a chat model. This can be simple, so let's just use GPT40 mini. Now, I add simple memory and give this a fixed key. For the tool, let's add an HTTP request node. We want this to be a post method. And for the URL, we'll add this API.ai V1 chatbot ID reply. And instead of ID, we'll use the chatbot ID we noted down from when we created the chatbot in a base before. There we go. Under authentication, choose generic credential type header off and pick a base from the list. Perfect. We also need to include a body. Put the name message here and let the model decide the value. We also want to add a session ID and again let the model decide this value too. Let's scroll back up and give this tool a description. Now let's rename this get internal knowledge. Perfect. Now, let's go back to the AI agent and give it some instructions. There we go. Let's test it out. Awesome. It works perfectly. So now we have both knowledge from the open internet and internal knowledge we can use for our blog post. And as always, full transparency, 8base is one of the SAS products my team and I run. And if you don't want to pay the $99 per month for the pro plan, we actually offer access to 8base as a lifetime deal too. If you go to founderstack.pro, you will get a bundle containing not just a base, but also feed hive, link drip, and tiny kiwi. Basically, my entire SAS portfolio for a single one-time purchase. And with this deal, you get access to the equivalent of the pro plan with 8base. So you can fully leverage the API and all its cool automation capabilities. Okay. Finally, let's tidy this up. This is now a part of the working workflow, too. Now, we can finally move on to writing the actual blog post. And because we've prepared, planned, and researched our post already, we just need one AI to handle the actual writing. If you prefer, you can fine-tune a model for this if you want a specific tone of voice. Or you can use a base model of choice. Claude, Deepseek, Gemini, Open AI, they all have very capable base models for basic content writing, which means that this part is going to be pretty easy to set up. My go-to here is going to be 03 Mini from OpenAI, which is a chain of thought model. I think it does very well for this type of task. As always, let's give it a system prompt. We'll give it a description of its task. And we'll add a user message, too. And we'll provide it with all the things it needs to write the post. Let's test it out. And look at that. A fulllength, well-ritten, wellressearched blog post with unique knowledge and sources from the internet. I mean, this is valuable. I would now read this and find it interesting and valuable even if AI put it all together. And this is exactly what we want. At this point, the system was working. But there was one thing still missing. This was optional, but I personally think a blog post should have a nicel looking thumbnail. And not just that, I wanted a thumbnail that was consistent on the brand and fit in with the website design and the overall blog page. And this part was tricky. My first approach was simply to use Flux to generate the thumbnails based on the image description created by one of the agents and then have another agent put some text on top. I just don't think they fit. Well, I personally really like them. Me, too. I think they're the best thumbnails I've ever seen. Could you guys just be honest for once? Yeah, they suck. Absolutely awful. Listen, Simon, if you want this part without coding, this is the best you will get. Hey, why don't we just vibe code it? Vibe code it? Ah, yes. You tell us how you'd like it and we'll code a program that generates the perfect thumbnails. You know how to do that, Simon? Please. I'm not going to go too deep into details about this part. What I can say is I used cursor to vi code a solution using NodeJS and a library called canvas. And after a few hours I had a perfect solution running on a custom API. This API would take an image, a text, a color theme, and a list of highlighted words and then put a thumbnail together on this specific theme. And it works perfectly. The easiest way to generate images from AI is using Flux on Replicate. Go to replicate.com and create an account. Go to AI tokens and create a new token. And just like we did with Abase, create a new credential from the NAN dashboard. Add authorization in the name and type bearer space. Then paste the API key from replicate. Now we can add an HTTP request node. Let's change this to post. Use the URL API replicate v1 models black forest labs flux predictions. In authentication, use generate credential type header off and pick the replicate credentials from the list and as a body let's add these fields using JSON. For the prompt, let's finally use the image description from the very first step. And to make our lives a little easier, let's add this header with the name prefer and the value wait. This will make the request wait for the actual image to be generated before it returns a response. Let's see. Awesome. Now, you can use this image as is. You can also change the proportions to 69 if this fits better. And in my case, I'll quickly add another AI here which is responsible for generating the parameters for my custom thumbnail API. Let's add an HTTP node for the thumbnail API here. And when we put it all together, boom, there we go. If you're up for the challenge, try opening cursor and vibe code your own API like this. If you're not a programmer, I wouldn't do this for commercial productionready software, but for a small extension like this, I think it is perfectly good and fun to use AI to vibe code a solution, even if you're not a professional software engineer. From here, the only thing left is to publish the actual blog post. For me, this publishing step includes pushing the title, description, content of the blog post, and the thumbnail to Strappy, where I keep all my blog content. I also have a step that uses a trigger in feed hive. So the blog post gets published on social media too. For you this publishing step might look different. Nadn has firstparty integrations with strappy WordPress web flow and a lot of other tools. So this part is up to you to set up according to your needs. But as you can see this now works fully autonomously. It requires no human intermediate steps. After setting up this workflow, simply lean back and watch blog post coming out every day or every other day or once a week, however often you want to post. This has been a total game changer for our blogs and we're seeing really good results with literally no effort, zero. It's fully automated. And while that being said, I still need to make an important point here. This is extremely experimental and potentially really risky. So if SEO is your best performing channel, if it is the top channel for your business where mostly all your users come from, if you have spent years perfecting your writing skills and your blog really means a lot to you, then probably you don't want to do this. You've probably noticed that I put a whole lot of effort into making these YouTube videos and that's because this is my highest performing channel and I would never try to fully automate this with AI. I care way too much about it to go down that road. But for me in my business, my blogs are way down the list. They were really never performing that well and they were more or less dead for a good while. So for me, this was totally worth the gamble and so far it's working out really well. But before you consider replicating this setup, just keep in mind where you see your blog post fit into your business. If it's higher on the list or you're planning for it to be higher on the list, you probably want to reconsider using this exact approach. By all means, though, set it up, play around with it, and see if it's useful for your business, too. You can get access to both Abbase and Feed Hive, as well as two other tools for a single lifetime purchase on Foundersstack.pro. And as a Founder Stack member, you can also download this entire workflow and import it into your own NN account to save some extra time. I have put links in the description for all of this. Now, excuse me. I need to get back to work, or rather my agents will. But if you want to see how to set up a similar workflow, but for content on social media, check out this video next. I will see you over there.

================================================================================

[Music] let's face it packaging cells you want a sass product that looks appealing modern professional and thoughtfully designed you probably know that many high-end perfume Brands actually design the Box first then the bottle and then finally once the designs have been tested and validated they create the actual perfume and it's because they understand that the packaging of a product is crucial for its success Steve Jobs and apple understood this when it came to Hardware way before most of the competitors with software and SAS the equivalent of this is the UI the look and feel of your product if you want to make your product more sellable you should make the UI and design of your app one of the highest priorities from the very beginning this shouldn't be an afterthought and one of the easiest ways to get this premium grade look and feel is to use UI kits created by professional designers my products feed hiive eight base tiny qy and Link drip all get a lot of praise for their Sleek designs and professional uiux and yes we do have a professional UI engineer on my team but the truth is we're not creating everything from scratch far from it in fact we're heavy users of pre-made UI kits and in this video I'll share some of my favorite picks let's kick things off with Untitled UI a comprehensive and beautiful looking UI kit that's designed specifically for building High Fidelity prototypes and Polished final products this tool comes packed with over 3,000 components and hundreds of predesigned templates that make it super easy to build an amazing interface it's built for figma and it can be as advanced as you prefer I'm no figma expert by any means but I've still managed to build some really Nic looking UI using this kit and the UI designer on my team loves it cuz she can go nuts with auto layout variables smart variants accessibility features and all those things that make it a pleasure to work with for professional UI engineers and now figma has Dev mode and they have a vs code extension too we're also using cursor to help with web development and simply giving the cursor agent a reference image of the designs actually works really really well it's all making it a really smooth process to build amazing premium grade products Untitled UI has both a free and a paid version the paid version is a little expensive compared to other UI kits but honestly it's totally worth the money next one on the list is Shaden this is arguably one of the hottest UI kits we currently have available it's not only a design system like Untitled UI Shaden provides you with reusable accessible react components that you can copy and paste directly into your code base you can think of it as a curated set of high quality building blocks the cool thing about shn is how easily customizable it is all of the components are already really well designed but if you want to tweak them it's very easy to adjust them using Tailwind CSS this will give you full control but will help your app keep a unique and consistent design if you have a uiux engineer on your team Shi and also has official figma files for all of their components you can use these figma files to customize and refine the look and feel then apply the themes to the component system itself with pretty minimal effort and also here you get the benefit benefit of a very AI friendly component system open Ai and Claw know their way around both shadsy and Tailwind so it's very easy to give it instructions and have cursor carry out an almost Flawless implementation next let's take a look at base design system from Uber this is a small toolkit designed for building web interfaces that require sophisticated and modern aesthetic it offers a full Suite of components that are tailored for creating interfaces with focus on Urban and modern Design Elements this toolkit is intended to help teams buil web applications rapidly while maintaining consistency with Uber's design language Uber's style guide is rather minimalistic it supports what they call the user Centric design philosophy which means it's focusing on Clarity efficiency and accessibility it's not exactly as comprehensive as some of the other UI kits but it's free it's very easy to use and in my opinion quite Nic looking though one downside is that the Uber design is fairly recognizable so if you don't want people to get Uber associations when using your app perhaps this UI kit is not the way to go an alternative to this design kit is bootstrap 5 UI kit which reminds a bit of uber Bas but has a little bit less distinct Uber look and feel to it next on the list we have another UI component kit for react called sassui this is one of those hidden gems that deserves much more attention sassui is created for nexj and react apps and it's built on top of chakra UI one of the most popular component systems for react just like Shaden ssui offers an extensive collection of pre-built components these include everything from simple UI elements like buttons and forms to more complex components like data tables and charts this library is designed to help you build intuitive and Visually appealing user interfaces and in addition to the component Library sasi offers a variety of starter kits as well these kits come preconfigured with essential features like authentication navigation billing and much more they are designed to help you get up and running quickly and reduce the time you spent on setting up so you can focus on building your product my team and I are actually using SAS UI for one of our products as you can see on their website we got eight base right there as well as a testimonial from me a little further down and I truly mean it when I say that this component library has been a massive heal it's obvious that an incredible amount of work has gone into this and despite it being relatively new it's still very robust and well tested one downside of course is that while SAS UI does provide a whole lot of flexibility and power it might be more than what you need if you're simply looking for the sign system for your app all in all though really love this product I highly recommend checking it out another UI component library and design system I rarely hear anyone mention is reshaped and it's a shame cuz it's such a NIC looking design system with reshape you get access to a component library for react a figma file with the full design system system and if you want to create your own custom design system from scratch reshaped actually provides you with a ton of Handy utilities that will save you ton of time it's a simple but beautiful looking UI kit that definitely deserves more attention they have a basic free tier and a very affordable full version at a onetime cost if you want the full source code version it's a bit more expensive but for most use cases the design license will do perfectly fine finally I recently stumbled on this brand new UI kit specifically for AI chat interfaces it's called assistant UI it's built on top of shat CN and contains readymade components specifically designed to build a chat-like interface like chat GPT Gemini CLA deep seek and so on it's very small and simple and it has this one specific purpose but let's face it a whole lot of products are now building some sort of chat interfaces into their SAS and this does look really nice don't make the mistake of thinking that your prototype or MVP isn't supposed to look nice it is users just won't settle with crap looking apps anymore and trust me even if your solution is still Scrappy in the beginning it adds a ton to the perceived value of your product if you prioritize making it feel and look nice from the very beginning and with these UI kits you can do that at almost no extra time and cost now to get your SS off ground you also need to cover operations marketing and growth and in this video I'll go through the most economic version of this entire setup for you I will see you over there

TITLE: 5 (Real) AI Agent Business Ideas For 2025
VIDEO ID: 2P9gPux6UfI
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P9gPux6UfI
================================================================================

it has now been more than 3 years and new AI Technologies still keep popping up but honestly it's only very recently that AI went from hype to actually becoming really useful you can now build complex AI agent workflows to handle work previously required human labor you can train and fine-tune your own custom AI models to carry out very specialized tasks you can even prototyp code and do the work of a small development team all by yourself there's a lot of opportunity here but we also need to be realistic all of this is still very early stage and while the interest in replacing human work with AI is Skyhigh there's still quite a barrier to entry but the good part about that is that it's creating business opportunities for you who know how to handle AI in this video I will give you five realistic ideas on how to monetize your AI agents tools and expertise in 2025 no real ideas with real potential and break Downs of how to carry them out let's go it's pretty clear that we're entering a phase where AI agents will start taking over a lot of the manual work people used to do using traditional SAS software early adopters are already jumping onto this as we speak and it opens the doors for a lot of business to be made so here's the first idea selling AI agent workflows the most sophisticated tool to build AI agents right now is NN nadn is an automation to tool kind of like sapure and make you can build complex workflows and Integrations with any tool that has an API and the best part is nadn has one of the best if not the best AI agent implementation on the market right now which means that you can build real sophisticated agenic workflow using models from open AI clot deep seek and many others and here's where the business opportunity comes in these workflows often get very complex and they're pretty timec consuming to put together there are a ton of great tutorials on YouTube on how to do this but I know for a fact that many businesses especially small businesses would be happy to pay for a complex workflow that has been already crafted and that they can incorporate into their own workflows directly and there are two ways you can do this the first one is by selling workflow templates let's say you have spent hours creating a really useful and valuable workflow in nadn you want to offer this to your users the most straight forward way to monetize this is to export the finished workflow file directly from nadn and then let people buy access to this file for a one-time payment you can put up a simple website and using a payment system like stripe and then send the user the workflow file in an email after they purchase people have been doing this with notion templates figma templates webflow templates and so on it's pretty much the same principle the other one is by selling access to workflow runs in n you can expose your workflow through a web hook so your workflow can be triggered by another nadn workflow or another system entirely for that matter in this way people can call your workflow through nad's API and get the final result or output but they don't have to worry about the details of the workflow itself so after the user purchases access you simply send them this URL now they can add your workflow as a tool for their own AI agents to use they can simply call this as they would with any other API and if you want to protect it to make sure only paying users have access nadn got you covered you can add authentication directly to the web hook node that triggers the workflow now with this method the workflow is running on your nadn account and if it's using AI it's consuming tokens from your accounts so since this is consuming resources on your end it might make sense selling access to this workflow as a subscription or a per call basis rather than a one-time purchase both of these are great ways to monetize your nadn work now selling AI agents is a brand new opportunity since they haven't been around for very long but there's another opportunity that has been around almost forever and that's selling knowledge you can sell info products paid courses coaching master classes and so on the idea of selling knowledge isn't new at all but AI is giving you a very new format and a new medium to do it specifically I'm talking about knowledge-based AI chatbots consider this example you want to learn how to run paid ads on Facebook you now have a few options you can learn it by yourself or you can lean on the knowledge of someone who has the right credentials or expertise you might join the master classes offered by Ben Heath Media or you might buy the maker ads guide which is a paid course both are great but imagine this instead of buying access to a course you get access to a chatbot similar to chat DT that was trained specifically on the knowledge from and by your favorite author on a specific topic you can now ask this chatbot specific questions and it will use its knowledge to help and guide you in the process using expert knowledge but with the context of your specific case this could be offered as an addition to a paid course or as a standalone product now let's flip it around if you're that expert or you have access to expert knowledge then you can offer this specialized AI chatbot to your audience here's exactly how I would set this up I would use a tool called eight base to create the chatbot and manage all the knowledge with eight base you can create and manage a knowledge Base by using public knowledge like websites or YouTube videos but you can also upload documents like PDF files or manage your knowledge base directly an eight basis Rich FAQ editor this makes it easy to create create manage and update a large knowledge base for your AI chatbot now you can train on this data give the AI chatbot access to the knowledge and put this chatbot on your website behind a pay wall for paying users what you should never do is giving your knowledge base to a custom GPT in a system prompt it is super easy to trick the AI into spitting out the entire system prompt which you definitely want to avoid large language models also tend to perform pretty bad on large contexts eight base doesn't have any system prompt instead it is actively querying the specific data it needs for each chat message based on what is being asked using a technology called rag with eight base you can even inspect each conversation see which knowledge it retrieves and correct it on the Fly for a more accurate reply in future conversations it's a really solid approach and full disclosure eight bases one of the SAS products my team and I run so I am a little biased here but personally I have not seen any other tool handle a knowledge base and a UI based rack system as well as 8B does and let me just blow your mind for a second right now you can buy lifetime access to eight Bas for a single onetime purchase that means that you can invest in eight Bas once and use it to sell your knowledge-based AI chatbots recurringly to your clients now there are some limits to how many monthly messages the chatbot can handle with this deal but if you can stay within those limits there is potential for a massive Roi if you use eight base for your business oh and by the way in this lifetime deal you also get access to three other tools all included go to found stack. proo and check it out I'll leave a link in the description all right so far we've considered offering AI built around existing tools but what if you could train or fine-tune your very own AI model and offer access to it directly your using an API let's talk about selling access to a custom AI model you probably already know that you can download and use open source models like flux stable diffusion deep seek and many others they're available to download on huging face you can now specialize these models by using a technique called fine-tuning perhaps you want flux which is an image generation model to Output images of a very specific kind for instance you can find you a flux model to create h eyes for a 3D software like blender or you can find un to create Vivid high contrast YouTube thumbnails that will get more clicks or you can fine-tune deep seek to reply in a specific way or in a specific format this kind of fine-tuned version of an open source based model is called a Laura model and getting a Laura model really good might take a lot of tries a lot of experimenting tweaking tuning and depending on what you're fine- tuning for might require specific expert expse and knowledge so again if you have that knowledge and you have managed to train a really good Laura model you can absolutely charge people to use this model the best way to do this is to use a platform called replicate with replicate you can deploy fine-tune and run AI models at scale you can do the fine-tuning jobs directly on replicate itself or you can upload your Laura models to replicate and expose it through replicates API and similar to the first example with NAD also here you can charge users to use this API you can either provide an API key to replicates API directly or you can develop your own proxy API that you can put in front of replicate both ways would enable users to run your Laura model without neither you or the users having to deal with complex infrastructure and GPU Hardware scaling and so on and so on I think this is an excellent opportunity to monetize AI now let's talk about a way you can use a ey indirectly to get better results with your products services or to help monetize something that would otherwise be considered just a fun hobby project if you've been active on Twitter in the past few weeks you might have stumbled on this expression called Vibe coding which basically means using cursor or wind Ser to do all the coding for you based on a Vibe this resulted in some really interesting project mostly small Indie Games created with 3js and cursor Peter levels was one of the first to create a small game and within just a few days he was already making tens of thousands of dollars in ads but a bunch of other people followed up this guy Nicola created a small sailing game called Vibe sale and also here advertisers jumped on board and generated a fair amount of revenue for this guy in fact I bought a Founder stack Banner myself for this game and it's actually producing clicks not long after people introduced the notion of Vibe marketing and Vibe designing and Vibe entrepreneuring and people started having all kinds of different takes on this and a bunch of people praised this new approach about vibing everything and I just want to make it clear I don't think that's a good idea at all I know some people give the impression that that's all they're doing and that it's all fun and play but I firmly believe that being structured organized and very intentional with what you're doing will by the end of the day create the best outcome however I still think we can use the concept of vibing to put new ideas to the test I think it's an excellent approach for prototyping and testing the waters I can totally see myself Vibe coding a simple new product then Vibe designing some quick ads and see if I can get some interest and if something catches on you can then switch vibing to a more intentional approach finally let's talk about the last and most obvious way to monetize your AI Solutions some businesses don't don't want to buy your workflow files they don't want to access your knowledge so they can learn they don't even want to buy access to an API endpoint so they can consume your AI directly they literally want you to come and set everything up for them without having to do or learn anything there are a lot of businesses right now who totally get the point they know that getting into Ai and automation is the way to get a Competitive Edge and to Future proove their businesses they just don't have a clue how and an obvious way for you to do business is by running an AI automation agency that offers businesses to implement it for them just a few years ago you heard people talk about AI automation agencies and it kind of wasn't something people took too seriously that has definitely changed take a look at what Liam otley is doing he is one great example if you know how to set up complex automation if you know how to fine tune and create Laura models and if you don't mind working with clients directly then consider offering your expertise as an AI consultant or through your own AI automation agency in the next 2 years I think we're going to see a ton of New Opportunities and a lot of amazing new ways to do business that's going to be different from the traditional SAS model these were five ideas on how to turn AI into an offer but another totally overlooked area is using AI for internal operations to run a more lean and efficient startup and in this video I will show you eight AI tools I use to run my business go watch this video next I will see you over there take care

TITLE: Replace Your Expensive Cloud Tools With These (Self-Hostable) Alternatives
VIDEO ID: vpiiqbpdkNk
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpiiqbpdkNk
================================================================================

I replaced six tools with free open- source and self- hostable Alternatives and it's saving me more than $10,000 every year and not only that my team and I got much more productive after changing these tools I bet you're already very familiar with notion sapure make air table post hog and a lot of other of these fashionable SAS tools but I also bet that you probably haven't heard of these free and self- hostable Alternatives that we replace them with so I want to bring them to your attention in this video I'll show you six amazing free tools that you can use to run your business if you're new to this channel welcome here I'm Simon harberg and I'm the founder of a SAS portfolio consisting of four bootstrapped SAS products to handle social media AI customer support link tracking and Graphics design we are a small and fully remote startup team and this year we are in the process of leaving the cloud and what better place to start than to replace a lot of the expensive SAS tools we use with free self hostable Alternatives that we host on our own servers let's go the first tool we're replacing is notion and I'll be honest it's actually a bit sad we changed from clickup to notion a few years back and it was such a massive Improvement and I got so hooked on this tool that I quickly ended up covering both internal vikii project management and for Content too we used notion together with make to write both newsletters and blog post directly in no's editor and then using automation to publish and send it out but notion was starting to run a bit expensive with their per seed pricing and if I'm being honest I think they're trying a bit too hard to become an everything app at least for my team and I things just started to get a bit chaotic so we're branching out three separate responsibilities and replacing them with each their own tool for internal Vicki and documentation we're now using dogmost it reminds a lot of notion but it only covers the do and notes part and it does that really well dog is completely free and open source and very easy to deploy to either your own servers or your Cloud platform of choice for project management we're now using plane very simple minimalistic project management tool that covers exactly what you need to collaborate no more no less you can self-host plane for free but they actually sell an upgraded version of their software as a lifetime deal it's $799 one time and then you get access to additional useful features such as Cycles time tracking and realtime collaboration we picked up this lifetime deal I can only recommend it finally for blogs and newsletters we're now using an actual CMS it's called strappy and it's a perfect solution for small teams if you can live without single sign on and support they have a free version that you can self host two other tools that we're getting really expensive for us were separ and make in all fairness we almost left separ all together throughout 2024 the whole platform experience was just getting unbearably slow and clunky for a long time make was our go-to it was a more lightweight faster and more affordable alternative to seure this worked well for a while until make started to feel more and more like sapure sluggish kind of clunky to navigate and as your workflows get more complex and start piling up prices get up there too so we made a decision and replaced both separ and make entirely with this tool called nadn not only do you get unlimited workflows if you self-host nadn but it is also a much much better tool n8n is a really powerful automation tool but it is also the tool that has the best fully working AI agent implementation I have tried I have a whole video where I show you how I build AI agents in naden I'll drop that at the end of this video so stick around for that the next tool on the list is our air table alternative to be honest I actually don't have anything negative to say about air T it's a wonderful tool it's been around for a long time and even though it's a total Beast it's still a delight to use it pricing is also fair but since we're already down the rabbit hole here we decided to replace air table with a free self- hostable alternative too and that's nood DB super cool air table alternative it's more simple but absolutely gets the job done and yes they have a free Community Edition that you can self host to and with a database tool like this it actually gives you the added benefit of keeping your data totally private when it's hosted on your own servers now as a SAS business you need analytics it is just such a super important part of your work I've used a bunch of different tools and the only ones that are decent are amplitude and post Haw both expensive both super clunky slow and endlessly frustrating to use and the thing is you still can't get them to report accurately ask anyone I don't don't know a single founder who doesn't struggle with analytics in one way or another and at some point accept that it's just never going to report exactly how you would like it until recently I made a decision a lot of people probably wouldn't agree with but it just finally works and it's free hear me out I set up a postris database started manually loging my events and then using Graff to visualize it I have never had better analytics than this I can use SQL to describe exactly how I want my data aggregated and visualized and grafana is surprisingly intuitive even though it's a pretty Advanced tool now I get product analytics where I have all other metrics as well as lcks it's super fast I can customize it exactly in the way I want and if you suck at SQL like I do chat gbt is very very good at it and it will help you get your queries just right so you can finally report things accurately as a bonus I want to add deep seek to the list I'm sure you've heard all about it but deep seek is a new AI model that performs on the same level as chat GPT but require much less resources and it's open source you can literally go to huging phas and download the models you can then either run these models locally if your computer has the right specs or if you have users to serve you can get a GPU line on hetner for just €84 per month and host the models here now you have your own chat GPT for a fixed monthly cost this is absolutely something I'm very excited to try out as you may know I'm offering lifetime access to all of my four SAS products for a single onetime purchase and when it comes to Lifetime deals keeping your cost low and predictable is crucial two of the products that are included in this offer are using AI quite extensively so if there's anything that can get me really excited it's the thought of AI at a fixed cost and it seems like we're finally getting there as always I have added links to all of these resources in the description below so please go check it out see if it's something you can use too and remember to go St them all on GitHub the acknowledgement means a whole lot for these projects if you want to see how I put together an AI agent using nadn and feed hve go watch this video next see you over there

TITLE: How I Generate +100 SaaS Ideas
VIDEO ID: 1oDRa8DzVkw
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oDRa8DzVkw
================================================================================

every year I generate hundreds of new SAS ideas I put a dozen of them to the test and I launch at least one so how do I do this well I'm here on the public Street of the internet and I use what we all have publicly available in this video I'll show you the exact framework I use to generate hundreds of potential sass ideas every year first of all if you're new to this channel welcome here I'm Simon and I am what you would call a diversified entrepreneur and one of the ways I've become that is by running a portfolio of small SAS products instead of going all in on one big idea in 2022 I launched my first product feed highp later that year I launched link drip in 2023 I acquired a small tool called tiny kiwi and again later in 2023 I launched eight base these products are all bootstrapped profitable and driving Revenue but how do I succeed every time truth is I don't what you're seeing are the few ones that succeeded behind the scenes I have been dappling with hundreds of sass ideas I've put at least a few dozens to the test and in the end only a few came out on the other side and this is exactly what I recommend that you do don't go all in don't put all your money on red play a safe and diversified game now let me show you the framework I use to generate hundreds of ideas for potential SAS businesses first of all I'm a huge fan of building and already established markets I want to build here on a busy internet street with tons of traffic you don't need to innovate you can simply build an alternative to a tool users already know but build for users who are unsatisfied with the current solution so how do we do that let's go to reddit.com go to the search bar on top and type in alternative 2 then hit enter you're going to see a long list of posts where people ask alternative to Tool now you want to do the following open every item that you find interesting or relevant for every item go explore the website of the tool in question now read the Reddit post and find the reason why the user is looking for an alternative of course not all posts are going to be relevant here some will be old and some will be very far from something you would know or even be interested in trying to solve so we need to filter these a bit for each of these posts ask yourself the following questions is it viable for me to build an alternative be honest with yourself here don't commit to something way over the top stick to topics that you feel somewhat confident about getting into can I address the complaints the user is having again be honest with yourself here sometimes lack of feat featur is there for a reason what the user is asking might simply not be viable to solve now filter all your open tabs based on the above questions hopefully you're left with one or two tabs open still I got one here a my alternative interesting now before we go ahead and start setting up a Myro alternative we might want to have a bit more than a single Reddit comment to base our tool on in case you didn't know G2 is a product review website it's similar to trust pilot but they make a much bigger deal out of verifying the reviewers which makes most reviews more relevant and actionable this is exactly what we need let's head over to g2.com in the search bar let's type in the name of the product we're building an alternative for we can now see all the reviews for this product if we scroll down we'll find a place that says sort by and pick lowest rated that's right we want to find more people who are unsatisfied with this product and we want to know what they dis like so we can explore if building an alternative is an option let's start looking through these reviews even though G2 makes a big deal out of verifying their reviews a lot of reviews are still fairly relevant but once we start looking further we'll find reviews like this one amazing super valuable information here the website gets laggy it's hard to navigate using the interface is difficult and there's no way to revert changes back to a specific point in time these already really good Clues ideally we want to look for reviews that are recent no older than 3 months specific they should address specific pain points actionable they should describe how the user would have wanted it instead the goal is to find at least 5 to 10 additional reviews from people who are struggling with the platform and see if we can find some Comon patterns between them and if they're all mentioning the same issues we might have a potential SAS idea in this case a more lightweight Myro alternative that's easier to use and runs much faster in the browser not bad now let me just make something clear nothing can beat good qualitative research like the thing we're doing right here it's boring and sometimes very tedious work but as the founder you should be doing this that being said a lot have changed on the streets of the internet recently and we would be missing out if we didn't do this last thing let's visit the new building down the street this is where things get really exciting first let's go find a Chrome extension called Go full page this will allow you to take full page screenshots of any website there we go now let's take a screenshot of at least the first three full pages of bad reviews on D2 like that and if you want to you can expand on this step you can go search on trust pilot Capa find Facebook reviews anywhere on the internet where people have something to say about your product at this step we care a little less about the quality of the data we just want a lot of it let's go and upload these images to chat GPT next we're going to use this prompt not going to read it all aloud but I will leave it in the description so you can copy paste let's replace these and there we go now chat gpg will take all of these reviews and output a very detailed business case and finish up with a very specific outline for a SAS idea now combine this with your own research that you did in step two and you might actually have something very cool to work off from here now before you rush into this new idea let me give you a serious piece of advice wait a bit let the idea sit for a bit before making a move create an ocean dog add the idea to an idea database let a week or two pass then revisit it and see if you're still excited about working on it in those two weeks either one of two things will typically happen you'll forget about it and start thinking about something else or your mind will keep going on and on about it if it's one of these ideas you just can't seem to let go of it might be a good candidate to take to the next level and remember you're a diversified entrepreneur even if it's a great idea you still shouldn't bit everything on it you should push this idea forward along with a series of other ideas and for that you need an entire SAS Factory in this video I'll show you exactly how to build a sass Factory step by step go watch that one now see you over there

TITLE: 4 Fast Business Ideas To First $1,000 MRR
VIDEO ID: IvwJU7AMQh4
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvwJU7AMQh4
================================================================================

if you're just getting started with your first online business getting to 10,000 Mr 20,000 Mr or even 83333 Mr if you know you know can seem incredibly overwhelming almost impossible to imagine if you're already on track to hit these goals that's awesome keep doing what you're doing but if you're not maybe you're not even close maybe you haven't made your first dollar online yet then this video is for you if you're just starting out you should focus on hitting your first m Stone of $1,000 monthly recurring revenue and in this video I'll show you four ways that might not be big million dollar s ideas but they will get you to $1,000 Mr much easier and faster than most other approaches let's go let me start by showing you a few popular Indie tools and see if you can spot what these have in common it looks like they're all cutting itch AI tools right well they kind of are but there's a catch it's not easy to see but if you were to open these tools and look under the hood here's roughly what the underlying architecture would look like these tools are what we call rappers and it's the first approach I would consider they basically take existing technology like open AI replicate and 11 laps which are created by some really really smart people then use the API for these tools and wrap it in their own UI so the scope of these tools is really just a front end and don't get me wrong I'm not talking these Founders down they are incredibly good at what they do which is spotting a great business opportunity and then marketing it on social media for profit some of these tools are generating tents even hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly and as more emerging new AI technology pops up I think there's a ton of potential here right now they typically use open AI to R text based SAS products such as chat Bots and content writers they use replicate to run diffusion models used for image generation and they use Luma to create video from text and use 11 labs to create speech and audio but new tools pop up all the time and many of them offer API access from the beginning of course the biggest downside is that these tools aren't cheap so the trade-off from building a rapper is that you'll rely on some other tools that eat a good bite of your margin but then again if you're aiming for a tool that's easy to build easy to maintain and can get you somewhere in the ,000 Mr range fast then I would definitely look into building a rapper instead of building a more complex product the next approach I would consider is something that takes a bit more time to set up initially and in most cases requires a little more technical knowledge however once it's created it has the potential to generate Revenue more or less passively the idea is simple you're going to sell something that saves other people a ton of time so they get to sell what they're building much faster I am of course talking about boiler plates and starter kits and yes I know there are a ton of boiler plates on the market already so why would you build yet another barlar plate because the market is always evolving and even though there are a lot of bar plates out there many of them are either outdated bloated or missing key features for today's Tex stack remember this is heavily tied to preference there's almost always room for another tool even if it's just a slightly different version of something that already already exists some people will prefer yours what I've seen work well is focusing on a specific KNE or Tech trend for example maybe you create a boiler plate specifically for S startups that integrate modern tools like stripe and tailor and CSS out of the box or maybe you focus on something that developers can use as a foundation for their own products like a romate template for an AI powered app that leverages open AI heck you could build a rapper boiler plate that will help people build rappers faster what's great about this approach is that once you've built the boiler plate you can sell it over and over again with very little maintenance and as more people discover your product it essentially becomes a passive income stream the key here is making sure your boiler plate truly solves a problem and is well documented so people can get up and running with minimal friction and boiler plates aren't just for developers either there's an increasing demand for pre-made Design Systems UI kits and no code templates too so if you're more design oriented this could be your opportunity to create a resource that helps the signers or no coders save time and remember you don't need to become the lead boiler plate or dominate this Market in any way to produce $1,000 per month consistently this way okay let's explore something a bit more futuristic this isn't really a fully developed market yet but it's definitely coming up a year ago open AI announced custom gpts and people immediately saw a huge business opportunity here some people even call this the new app store marketplace where you can build custom gbts specialized agents that you can market and sell directly from open ai's platform and it flopped no one's talking about this anymore and I don't think anyone in their right Minds would pay to have access to a custom GPT today mostly because let's face it they suck they don't really do anything different than the normal chat gbg but that doesn't mean the idea itself is bad one of the S products I run is 8base which is an AI powered support tool and one of its primary task is to train AI models on users data what I can tell you is if you're using the right techniques you can absolutely make a custom chatbot really good I have an AI version of myself hosted on my website I call it Simon Ai and I have people talking to it picking my brain every day now mine is totally free to access but I am absolutely convinced that you could charge for a highly specialized AI chatbot like this if you're a lawyer specializing in something specific you could train a custom AI model on your expertise and sell access at a low price if you're a fitness coach with a specific expert domain you could create an AI agent trained on Fitness plans and nutrition advice tailored specifically for people with specific dietary needs if you're a financial adviser with expertise and using specific investment instruments you could create an AI agent that will give advice on exactly this the key here is specialized knowledge chat DBT CLA llama they're all really good but they're very generic I firmly believe that people would pay to access specialized domain level AI agents especially if they're backed by training data on real life experts with the right credentials the only catch is you can't use open AI custom gbts for this they do utterly suck you need to go through the trouble of fine-tuning your models though it's not as hard as you might think and open AI has excellent documentation on how to do this would you like a video where I show you how to do this please leave a comment below and let me know all right let's shift gears when most of us hear monthly recurring Revenue we think about SAS typically when we talk about more traditional service businesses or e-commerce businesses we don't use the term recurring Revenue even though both agencies and e-com businesses are heavily focused on repeat buyers too if you're a freelancer or you run an agency I bet you know exactly what I'm talking about here but in imagine if you could capture these repeat buyers on an actual subscription just like you would on a SAS before your agency instead this is exactly what some small agencies have started doing and it's working surprisingly well you might have heard about popular design agencies like design Jor design me but this could work with any kind of service business like web development marketing social media management and so on and here's the trick to make this model sustainable you have to productize your service so what what does that mean it means turning your service into a packaged offer with clear deliverables that are repeatable instead of Custom Tailoring every project you set boundaries on what you'll provide each month for instance a set number of designs or updates to a website this way the work doesn't pile up and you can serve multiple clients without burning out by prioritizing your services you make it easier for clients to understand exactly what they're paying for and it makes your life way more manageable because you can systemize and streamline the delivery but why would customers want to sign up for a subscription like this in the first place the answer is simple peace of mind and convenience some businesses don't want to be constantly searching for Freelancers or agencies to solve small problems that pop up every month they need ongoing support and they want to know that they have someone reliable to handle it whether it's updating their website creating new graphics or managing their social media presence let's say you charge $500 per month you only need two clients to hit that $1,000 mark four clients at 250 per month you've hit your target now the focus on these four approaches is to get a monthly recurring revenue of $1,000 but none of these ideas are restricted to that in fact most of the examples I brought here is making much more than that so while these ideas are I would say great beginner friendly business ideas there's nothing that prevents you from scaling this into $10,000 or $220,000 Mr if you want me to expand on any of these approaches let me know in the comments and I'll consider turning that into a video on its own if you got value please give this video a like And subscribe to my channel for more content like this I'll see you soon for another video

TITLE: 4 SaaS Trends to Blow up Your Business in 2024
VIDEO ID: QwQyw5R9ds0
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwQyw5R9ds0
================================================================================

this year started out rough 2023 was a turbulent year with full Market breakdowns and the beginning of 2024 showed higher turn slower growth and more startups going bust that we had seen in a long time and here I was running not one not two but four bootstrapped SAS products looking at my stripe account was painful the symptoms of the market movements were very clear I had to do something to save s business but I had no idea what to do next fortunately someone told me about this place where I could go and get help and of course I was desperate to find a solution so I went down there hello hello um I need to talk to a GPT hi Simon I'm a GPT generation 5 what can I help you with oh um I need to talk to an expert on SAS businesses absolutely I can help you with that what do you need to know okay um the market it's going crazy everything is down I need you to help me figure out how to save my SAS business of course though remember remember that the ideas I'm about to share with you are only starting points and shouldn't be seen as professional advice every business is unique and what works for one might not work for another yes thank you good my prediction is that there are four SAS trends that will be dominating the markets in 2024 tapping into any of these Trends might be exactly what you need to save your business do you want to hear more about these Trends that's why I'm here great the first one is white label s okay like letting people put their own logo and branding on my product and host it on their domain yes exactly okay uh I mean I'm actually already doing that with one of my products feed hiive some of our users are big agencies and they manage social media for their clients they want to invite their clients to a feed hiive workspace but they don't want it to say Fe Ty in the App instead they want their own name and logo and they want the app to be hosted on their domain but why is this going to be a trend in 2024 yes what you're describing is white labeling in the traditional sense but typically when people ask if they can wh label your SAS what they're actually asking is if they can resell it resell it yes and this is exactly what's becoming popular let me show you how it works a SAS company creates a SAS and provides the ability to upload a custom logo change the colors the fonts and the ability to provide access to a a custom domain a reseller buys a license to resell the SAS then puts their logo and name on it repackages it and sets their own price finally the end user buys access to the SAS and as far as they're concerned they think the SAS they're using is whatever the reseller chooses to call it I see reselling SAS software not bad what's the next one I'm not sure I understand you said there were four SAS Trends what's the next Trend I'm sorry your daily conversation limit has been reached please come back again tomorrow it was a very interesting conversation with the GPT and a very interesting suggestion it reminds me about dropshipping just for SAS and if you think about it some of the first people to jump on board with the Drop Shipping Trend did end up creating really successful businesses and I bet the wholesalers that were providing products made great business from this too I think there are two types of Founders who can greatly benefit from this new trend the first type is the founder who is an absolute beginner and wants to get started building a sass brand this type of founder typically has no experience with software engineering and no experience with building and maintaining a SAS not even using no code he is on the other hand great at marketing and creating a brand and because he can WID label a SAS that's already built he can enter the SAS market and start building his own SAS brand with almost no barrier to ENT the downside is that he has very little control over the actual SS he's selling what happens when users have technical issues when bugs need to be fixed what happens when they have feature requests all you can do is forward these issues and request to the SAS owner and hope that they'll deal with it which is risky since he might end up hurting his brand and reputation and the second type of founder is of course the technical SAS founder who knows how to create a SAS platform but isn't very strong on marketing or simply doesn't prefer spending a whole lot of time on that part there is a huge opportunity for this type of founder as he can do what he does best building software product and then let the resellers be out there on the market competing with each other in building the SAS brand of course he would still have to do a bit of marketing of his SAS as a white label SAS solution but since he could charge the resellers either based on commission or simply just charge them a quite significant amount for a license he wouldn't need nearly as many resellers as customers to make the economics of a SAS like this work the GPT was definitely onto something here though there's just one huge downside I couldn't really get off my mind as a white label provider you're basically sharing the market with your resellers feed hiive already has a wh label solution for agencies go to feed.com and sign up for an account use their white label solution to besides that it's already a pretty established brand so in my situation I wouldn't want to resell this product at this time I had to go back and talk to the GPT again I'm ready to hear about the next SAS Trend I'm glad you're back the next trend is a little controversial but try to listen with an open mind it's selling your sass as a lifetime deal a lifetime deal you mean like only charge for it once and then the user can use it forever that's exactly right no no no no I can't do that my products have ongoing cost so I'll try charge for users on an ongoing basis simple as that I understand why you feel that way but let me put this into perspective for you one of the reasons the market is down is because of subscription fatigue SAS businesses that run entirely on subscriptions are increasingly struggling to convert users all SAS products have churn no user actually stays forever even if they purchased your SAS on a lifetime offer really yes and on a classical subscription model you can use your churn braate to to calculate the average lifetime value of a subscriber that is the amount of money the average user pays before they churn if you charge the average lifetime value of a subscriber upfront as a lifetime purchase and assume the same churn rate the overall Revenue would be exactly the same but hold on it's not just about Revenue I don't want my users to devalue my product for instance I have big plans for one of my tools it's a design tool called tiny kiwi and it is going to be the next canva and I want my users to understand that you have big plans and that's great but let's be honest Simon is it really going to be the next canva well it has the potential I think it could be honestly probably not it's a very small tool it's limited and then there's absolutely no shame in that small and limited tools are amazing for some users they're much easier to use than complex tools like canva and with a small and limited tool the ongoing cost to run it will be minimal it sounds perfect for a lifetime deal you really think I should do this I'm sorry your daily conversation limit has been reached mother I would be lying if I said that didn't hurt but the GPT was right tiny Q was there ever going to be the next canva not even close tiny K is a tool I acquired last year today its primary purpose is to enhance the experience of feed hiive when creating fast social media posts the tool is almost entirely powered by the browser and makes relatively few database calls there are almost no backend operation at all I have a designer who creates new templates for tiny qwi but besides that my team doesn't really spend time on this tool and the GPT had a point this tool cost around $120 per month to run in total even as the userbase scales and after thinking about it for a while I decided to give it a try I created some nice looking Facebook ads to promote tiny kiwi as a lifetime offer instead of a subscription I hit the publish button and to my surprise it worked in the first month tiny kiwi made almost $110,000 in sales more than it had ever done before on a subscription model and with close to no maintenance this is almost like a passive income stream running entirely on Lifetime deals I was pumped to finally see a success One S product saved but what about the rest I wasn't very impressed at first but at this point I really needed to go back and hear what else the gpg had to [Music] say hello Simon I'm sorry but your daily conversation limit has been reached that's why you cannot get in but you said that yesterday correct you need to wait for 24 hours to pass GPT 5 is using a usage-based pricing model but in order to protect your finances we had a daily limit why can't I just get a subscription then at the moment we only offer a usage based pricing model as this model is gaining popularity with users in the SAS Market really yes cust customers love the clarity fairness and transparency when they see a direct correlation between usage and cost this helps build trust with our users interesting can you tell me more about that of course usage based pricing is very straightforward you pay for what you use no flat fees no guessing games about which plan fits best it's a model that aligns cost directly with the value received this model has been a game Cher for startups and small businesses that are cost sensitive and prefer a flexible cost structure yes usage based pricing also encourages users to explore a product more freely they're not boxed into specific features based on your subscription tier instead they have the entire toolbox at their disposal paying only for what they find useful ha you just slipped up you just told me about the third SAS Trend without me having to pay for it didn't you I knew it stupid AI you probably encountered this model more often lately especially with cloud services and apid driven tools and it makes perfect sense flat fee subscription models which is the most commonly used model today often Force users to pay for features they don't use imagine a SAS tool offering API calls or using AI as a core part of its features with usage based pricing you pay per call or per generated output you use more you pay more use less you pay less it's that simple I think this is is another great way to combat subscription fatigue on the other hand for SAS companies this model can be a bit tricky to implement it requires robust tracking and billing systems to Monitor and charge for usage accurately I know stripe has something called metered billing built-in but it's very basic in most cases it probably won't be enough and you'll have to deal with implementing a Billing System yourself also Revenue becomes more variable which can be a challenge for financial planning if you're offering a fully usage-based model with no base price most likely the average revenue per user will drop compared to the flat fee model though I do think that there are a lot of cases where the benefits outweigh a usage-based model can attract a broader range of customers especially those who are cost conscious or have fluctuating needs it's also a powerful tool for scaling as customers who grow will naturally increase their usage leading to higher revenues in the world of cloud and infrastructure Services we've been used to this model for a long time one of my Sal products is a base it's an AI powered support tool and after talking to the GPT I was definitely considering a usage based pricing model for this tool but before making a decision I had to know about the last SAS Trend the 24 hours were up I could finally go back hey GPT I'm ready for the last SAS Trend oh I'm sorry as for my knowledge cut off I don't have any knowledge of other SAS Trends besides the ones I've already told you about you're kidding right you said there were four SAS Tren I could use to say save my business you only gave me three so far I apologize for the confusion I only know about three SAS trends that are gaining popularity in 2024 they are white label SAS lifetime deals and usage-based pricing is there anything else I can help you with no no no I'm good you know what let me give you the last SAS Trend that's not how we usually do this just listen focus on building a micro SAS I know this isn't exactly a new trend but it's a trend I'm certain will become even bigger in 2024 some of the biggest sass tools we all know jira hopspot MailChimp Soho sent dis Salesforce have all been around for ages and besides generating enormous Revenue figures they all have one thing in common yes they were all built by Founders who they're slow that's what they have in common they're built on old technology and they're so bloated with features that while they do solve a thousand different problems the software itself is painfully slow and confusing to use this is why users increasingly prefer using micras but when you say micro SAS what exactly do you mean a micras is a lightweight specialized software product built to solve something very specific for a very specific type of user users love them because they're fast to use they often have a very minimalistic UI and they enable users to solve that very specific problem in a very efficient way Founders love them because they're much faster to build and get to Market there's less code to maintain and they're often quite beginner friendly I'm sorry but I don't think these so-called micro SAS solve a real problem true the challenge with micras is finding that perfect specific user with a specific problem to solve rather than dealing with complex software engineering ideally you want a problem that is small but frequent enough that it becomes worth paying for a solution and these problems can be found everywhere around us ask your friends and family what was a tiny pain you had today you wish you could be without write all the answers down look at patterns and see if some of these could potentially be solved with a micro SAS I learned a lot from the GPT I think these four SAS Trends white label lifetime deals usage based pricing and micro are going to show up a whole lot in the next years to come and I think it makes perfect sense to capitalize on that but I also learned that Trends aren't everything business Cycles will come and go growth isn't linear and sometimes all you have to do is just stick it out focus on getting through the tough times and prepare yourself for another ride up the roller coaster at a later point and hey if you don't have a SAS yet you should start building one what are you waiting for it's easy after all all you have to do is I'm sorry your daily conversation limit has been reached

TITLE: 5 A.I. SaaS Ideas To Launch In 2024
VIDEO ID: PFslOvkPXTI

================================================================================

if you thought the AI hype was about to die out you'd be very wrong open AI released fine-tuning new AI models and apparently a c star algorithm that can do some extremely Wild Things mid journey is constantly improving YouTube now allows you to chat directly with the YouTube video Google rolled out some massive improvements to B and AI is still even after a year all around us all the time last year around this time I published a YouTube video with seven AI SAS ideas you can start in 2023 and in this video I'll follow up with another five ideas you can start in 2024 though worth keeping in mind that a whole lot of things changed in the last year which is why some of these ideas might appear a bit different perhaps even a bit controversial but stay with me here and let's get started the first idea is an AI based tool to help you improve your marketing site imagine a tool that would dissect your website not just mechanically but with an artistic and strategic eye this tool will do more than just the basic Tech technical audit it would narrow in on the essence of what makes a website resonate with its target audience imagine this tool scanning your website's copy it's not just looking for errors but analyzing the effectiveness of your words it will suggest changes to make your messaging more compelling and relatable to your audience the tool would also review your s's layout and images it would help you ensure they're not just attractive but strategically placed for Maximum Impact think of it as having an AI power designer suggesting layout tweaks and image adjustments that are proven to grab attention and guide visitors to take action I imagine a simple interface where you provide a link to your current website and give the tool a bit of insight into your market and your target audience then hit analyze and get a full report with actionable recommendations to refine and improve your site you could use a combination of GPT 4 Del and vision to analyze a website and generate a report we already have a lot of tools that will do a technical analysis of your website with SEO as the main objective I but I haven't found a tool like this that would strictly focus on the experiments of the human and the psychology of sales and conversions let's move on to idea number two this one is building on top of the first idea but taking a radical step further an AI driven AB testing tool hear me out here this isn't just about split testing AI generator suggestions it's about implementing them and scientifically testing their effectiveness here's how it would work once the tool has analyzed and generated suggestions for improvements the ab Tes would spring into action it would automatically update your website and apply the changes and then it would set up a split test this means that your website would simultaneously present the original version and the modified version to different segments of your audience the beauty of this tool lies in its autonomous and continuous learning it would meticulously analyze user interactions on both versions of your site if the new changes lead to better engagement or higher conversions the tool would automatically Implement them across the board but it doesn't stop there it's a cycle of Perpetual improvements after deploying successful changes the tool would start the process all over again constantly searching for new areas to optimize and test it's like having a tireless AI marketer continuously experimenting and refining your website to Peak Performance this tool could use Technologies like Del or mid journey to produce new images and graphics and GPT 4 to produce new copy and at the same time work just like a no code website builder that's able to build and deploy a static website given a set of instructions and API calls of course the level of automation could be configurable you might want to generate a preview link of each new version and then have the user approve before starting a new split test though I really think this would be an awesome tool if you're already building or considering building a no code website builder maybe you should look into adding this part to stand out oh and this video is sponsored by eight base an AI powered support ecosystem built to give your users an outstanding customer experience on autopilot it's a new AI sayas my team and I recently launched and if you're running a small business and struggling to keep up with customer support you should pay attention now having live chat on your website or in your app is tricky cuz once it's there users tend to use it and the problem is if you're not responding within 30 to 60 second or at least within 5 minutes it's such a poor experience for the user that you're better off removing the live chat alt together eight base is here to solve that you can create a chat about in minutes and start training it on your own data right away add your landing page your blog posts medium articles or any other public website add any public YouTube videos upload documents such as PDF and of course create a custom knowledge base as an FAQ using 8 Bas Rich editor then add the chat bot to your website or app and have it answer all your users questions we offer a completely free plan to get you started and you can even bring your own open AI key to bypass some of the limitations of the free plan I've put a link in the description below check it out and get started with eight Bas today all right the next idea in our AI say lineup is a smart efficient solution to task that I think pretty much everyone hates booking we need an AI based accounting plugin this isn't another piece of accounting software it's a Plugin or a Chrome extension that integrates with your existing accounting tools and adds the power of AI picture this the plugin scans your invoices receipts and financial statements and using AI it categorizes and organizes the data in a way that aligns with accounting best practices now I'm currently using tools like aim. which is fantastic for automating web-based tasks but imagine something more specialized tailored specifically for accounting you would probably imagine these features being added to some of the existing accounting software in the near future but honestly for some reason these types of software tends to be slow at innovating and touching new tech so I actually don't think we're going to have something like that in most accounting software in any foreseeable future and I think a Chrome extension for this would be a super helpful micro SAS I'd buy it which brings me to the next idea an AI based file manager imagine this you select an entire desktop or a Google drive or a Dropbox or similar and you drop the whole thing into this tool and it will go through all folders all subfolders and all files look at the file names the dates the type of file the name of the folders and so on and so on and organize it in the most intuitive way can it will tidy up years of accumulated mess on your computer in a few seconds now I'm actually quite organized so I go through this painful process manually fairly often and yet I still end up with a hard drive mess really fast and I know some people who barely get work done because of this I imagine tool with a simple drag and drop interface or if it's a Google drive it could be a Chrome extension it should be able to organize based on best judgment but it should also optionally take a few instructions in case you have specific preferences now imagine bringing this to your notion dashboard your emails or other places where things tend to get out of hand I think this would be a super nice solution to a small but frequent and rather painful problem okay this last idea is a bit more Technical and Niche but hear me out a fine-tuning studio for synthetic data you've probably already heard all the talk about open Ai and qar one of the things it was speculated to do well was creating synthetic training data for the next generation of AI models in fact Microsoft already published research on this and I don't think there's any doubt this is going to be the future of AI one AI generating synthetic data to train the next Ai and as it turns out the same principle is already super useful when you're fine-tuning the existing models from open AI the idea itself is pretty straightforward you manually craft some data or pull it from the resources you have access to and then you use AI to generate new data with similar properties and similar patterns now you use that data to fine-tune a new AI model we did this while training the AI chat assistant for feed hve and creating the fine-tuned models for eight base and it works surprisingly well the only problem is that the process of generating it can be rather tedious and require a lot of scripting back and forth to align the format of data and the right type so here's the idea create assess that helps you prefabricate small samples of training data in a desired format allow the user to configure how varied the data should be how much it should be allowed to deviate and how outliers in the data set should look like and so on and then use gp4 to expand the data set based on the sample data and the requirements perhaps include features like anomaly detection validation and other use use ful tools open AI recently created a nice UI for fineing their model so of course be aware that something like this might be added by open AI itself however given how long it took them to add that simple UI we have now I don't think this is where their focus is at so in my opinion there's an obvious opportunity here and I would definitely subscribe to a tool like this now once you've created and launched any of these SAS ideas the real challeng is begin you need to get users on board and this is surprisingly hard which is why have created the perfect road mapap to get the first 100 users the first thousand users and Beyond I would highly recommend watching that one next remember to check out eight base and if you got value from this video remember to give it a like And subscribe to my channel

================================================================================

the support emails were pouring in way faster than I could possibly manage to keep up and it just didn't seem to stop I desperately needed to come up with a solution fast let's start from the beginning Twitter had just introduced their new API prices and we had sent out an announcement explaining that our products would discontinue the integration within a few hours our live chats were on fire and not in a good way we had a lot of angry users and a lot of understanding users but with a ton of questions at this time I had three people on chat support trying their best to keep up with the constant flow of new messages it was excruciating 3 weeks in and the first of my support agents resigned it was just too much then the second one resigned within another week or so so it was just me and one other support agent now and the messages just kept pouring in I tried my best to create articles that would explain some of the questions that kept recurring but it didn't help see as long as there's a live chat icon on your website users will use it and if they have to wait more than 5 minutes for a reply it's a bad experience and there was no way we could keep a response time that low my last support guy kept going like a soldier but it was pointless and the onear ratings kept coming in one after the other this just wasn't fair so I took the hard decision and I let him go at this point I was desperate that ding sound from our chat software was starting to give me trauma I could literally hear it in my sleep little did I know that what was about to happen was going to be far more agonizing I was desperate so I did the thing I removed the live chat from our app and website then it got quiet like dead quiet it was almost unsettling for a moment though this felt fantastic like a ton of weight was taken off my shoulders but obviously I knew that the problem didn't go away from just removing live chat and looking at my strip dasboard the next day confirmed my fear users were turning faster than I had ever seen before and now support emails were pouring in way faster that I could possibly manage to keep up I desperately needed to come up with a solution should I hire new support staff how long would it take to unboard them would this just create more problems and more overhead I was paralyzed it was truly one of these moments where I just closed my eyes and wished that the problem would magically go away but then I got an idea one of our features is a chat bot that helps write content for social media like chat GPT but specifically trained for Content what if I turned this chat bot into an AI support assistant if I could train it to know everything about my business it could answer users questions and help them with their problems around the clock it wouldn't need breaks it wouldn't need sleep it would always become C under pressure and it wouldn't even ask for pay hey I got to work and I spent the next 2 weeks grinding trying to solve this problem once and for all I realized that there would still be situations where users needed to get in contact with our team so I built a ticketing system directly into notion which we were already using for project management I added the chatbot the ticketing system and I pushed to production and the results were absolutely mind-blowing churn went down Revenue stabilized customer satisfaction went up users were happy at least in most cases we were still receiving tickets and emails but the need for human support was reduced by almost 90% compared to before absolutely mind-blowing and at this point I was not in doubt I had to turn this into a sass I am so excited to present a base an AI powered support ecosystem built to give your users and outstanding customer experience on autopilot you can create a chatbot in minutes and start training it on your own data right away add your landing page your blog posts medium articles or any other public website add any public YouTube videos upload documents such as PDF and create a custom knowledge based as an FAQ using a Bas Rich editor then add the chat bot to your website or app and have it answer all your users questions of course from the a based dashboard you can monitor all convers ation your users are having and uncover knowledge gaps in the replies your chatbot is giving if you notice it's answering incorrectly it's easy to exclude a specific piece of knowledge and by using the FAQ you can always create a new answer that better addresses the exact question this is perfect for customer support but it also works really well if you're a Creator or public person and you want an AI version of yourself that your audience can interact with in fact I have an AI version of myself on my website ready to answer Christians about SAS I mentioned before that we build a ticketing system into notion it worked well but it was very homemade and quite hard to use so instead we recreated the perfect AI power ticketing system in a base you can create a custom ticket form using our no code form Builder and easily embedded into your app this allows your users to create tickets which will appear in your 8base dashboard from here you can communicate with the user handle their issues and make sure they get a smooth experience the AI behind this ticket system uses your training data too but it also learns from every ticket you resolve and uses this to make Smart Suggestions when a new ticket comes in this will help you and your tech support team resolve issues 10 times faster with eight base you can stop spending unnecessary time on customer support or you're a developer that's awesome cuz we have made everything highly customizable and developer friendly you can take full control over the 8base elements and integrate them into into your app in countless different ways everything is built using web components so it doesn't care which UI framework you're using and it doesn't pollute your site with heavy eye frames you can set up web hooks to notify other parts of your system when tickets are updated new comments are created and much more and if you're not a developer don't worry cuz you can set up all chat Bots and ticket forms in a no code fashion too and we offer a hosted ticket page where your users can access all their Open tickets we're already working on in creations with a lot of third party tools and we're going to have email support announcements feature requests and a public API for teams that really want full control and here's the deal this tool has already been so valuable to us that I really just want to share it with you which is why you can get started with a base completely for free we have a free plan no trial you don't need to add a credit card you can literally just sign up and start using it but you probably know that offering this kind of AI tool at scale isn't exactly cheap so on a free plan you will be limited to 50 messages per month however if you bring your own API key from open AI we're going to remove this limit entirely you can use eight base for free with unlimited messages if you bring your own API key check the link in the description below and sign up for an a Bas account today are you still here thank you for listening to my story if you're a s founder with any level of Commercial Success big or small all I'm sure you've had a similar experience with customer support if you're using crisp chat or inom on your website right now and you're struggling to keep up with replies here's the best advice I can give you remove it studies show that having a live chat and not being able to deliver response within 5 minutes is a worse custom experience than not having a live chat at all so remove it and give eight base a try instead let me know what you think of our new project in the comments below I will see you soon for another video

this product makes almost a million dollar a year and it's completely bootstrapped this product makes almost a million dollar a month and it's only 2 years old and this product and this product and this product and this product they're all killing it but what do they have in common are they just all Superior Products they are great products but the reason they're exceptional is because they figured out how to blow up their user base and how to keep up momentum and growth continuously month after month this is not just luck this is science and fortunately if we break down what these startups do well we can reproduce it and Achieve explosive results too in this video I will give you a road map containing three simple but Mighty strategies for getting more users at every stage of your SAS Journey we'll take a look at how to get the first 100 users and how to get the next 500 to 1,000 users and finally we'll discover how successful SAS platforms use these strategies to blow up and continue to grow their user base to New Heights OH okay okay but let's just come back down to earth how about we start by getting the first five and probably most important users on board in order to get there we need to get a basic understanding of what it actually means to acquire a user a user acquisition simply means the act of gaining a new user for an app a platform or an online service every user acquisition has the following a method a channel and the cost and depending on the type of Acquisitions we're going for we need to plan these out and as you can imagine combining different forms of these three elements turns into a whole lot of different ways we can acquire a user ranging from completely free Acquisitions to paying a whole lot just to get one new user and ways that require a ton of work and doesn't scale and other ways that scale almost automatically without any additional effort and this is exactly why we need a road map tailored to the different stages of your SAS Journey cuz some of these methods work really well in the very beginning and others are excellent for putting your s g into growth mode or even automation mode where users just keep coming in but before we can get users we need to use these elements to design a user acquisition model and while these two elements are highly variable at least we can put the method into four different types let's have a look essentially all the different online marketing channels you can imagine fall into either one of these four methods incoming this means that the user reaches out to you they become aware of your product and they serve them El to sign up or makes a request to your team to get in contact with them so they can get on board outgoing this means that you reach out to the user the initial contact is on your side you initiate the conversation you make a sale and you convert them into a paid user referrals this happens when your current users will bring in new users who will in turn bring in more new users advertising this one is similar to the incoming method but what's specific with advertisement is that you pay to get in front of the user and make them aware of your product that way all right let's get busy we need to design two acquisition models that we want to use for the first stage of our road map we want to get our first five early users on board followed by getting the first 100 real users for the first five users we're going to design a model that looks something like this for the method we're going to use outgoing which means that we will reach out to the first batch of users and hopefully get five of them on board the channel we'll be using is email or DMS on whatever message app you're using and the cost is $0 since we're going to do this ourselves manually one by one the idea here is pretty simple you're going to use your close Network family friends colleagues Partners people you know personally who you believe would benefit from your product you will tell them that you're launching a product and that you have an MVP ready and that you're looking for the first few users to get on board you will offer them a completely free account for live and all you will ask for in return is their feedback of of course not all users will naturally be a good fit but if your product solves an actual problem for some of these early users it should definitely be possible to get five of them on board once you have these first five users in place make sure to include them all in a small community either a Discord group a Facebook group a WhatsApp group or whatever works for you before going on to the next step you want to spend a bit of time with this handful of new users listen to their feedback fix bugs Implement some features according to their wishes and smoothing out some of the rough edges make sure to serve these users well let them have a big say in how the platform should work and which direction you should take remember how I said that these users are the most important ones it'll be clear why in a moment cuz what we're trying to do here is to make these users more than just users we're turning them into Advocates and this is crucial for the next acquisition model we're going to design this model will take us from five up to 100 users for the method we're going to use referrals and the channel we're going to be using is referral links that are current early users can use the cost of this model depends you could offer your first users a cut of the revenue for every new users they refer but in most cases I actually don't think this is necessary if you truly did a great job of serving your first five early adopters really well and really make them feel like they're part of this project chances are they'll be happy to help refer new users without getting paid so I would Design This model with zero cost but instead offer the new users a big discount for joining early and for making both your Advocates and the new users feel a bit special for being part of something up and cominging this also greatly helps your Advocates bring in new users since they now have a really good offer on their hand most early users would love to help all right time to get serious we're now entering stage two of the road map at this stage we want to acquire 500 to 1,000 new users none of our current acquisition model will work for this it would be very hard to do zeroc cost Cod emails and DMS at this scale to realistically get 500 to to 1,000 users on board we also can expect to keep incentivizing new users to yet again refer new users at this scale we need a completely new model for this let's design it for the method we're going to use incoming which means that we will have users reach out to us or to sign up themselves by going to a website in order for this to work at scale we need to create awareness and I know and probably you know that what I'm about to say is going to make me sound like a completely broken record cuz I've said this in so many of my videos already the best way to create an acquisition model using the incoming method is by creating content and building in public the channels we're going to use are social media and search engines create long form video content to show up on YouTube search create blog post to show up on Google create Tik toks reals and YouTube shorts to catch people's attentions on the flight share updates on LinkedIn your highs and lows new discoveries new Milestones share your lessons on Hacker News and Indie hackers and most importantly keep doing it this stage is long and hard you're not going to see results very fast but you need to keep going this also means that this acquisition model is going to come with cost you must expect to invest in good content and how much you're willing to pay for an acquisition entirely depends on the RPO or average revenue per user your SAS is generating there's going to be long stretches where your content won't get much engagement let alone result in conversions so you need to closely Monitor and optimize on this part but I guarantee you this acquisition model works it just takes time so keep going let the revenue from existing users pay for acquiring new users until you hit at least 500 users this way and finally we're ready for the last stage at stage three we're going to take our user base from a th users and aim at continuously growing it this doesn't mean that stage two is now over you should definitely keep the incoming acquisition model going and you should keep creating content stage three is a bit special because there are multiple directions you can take you can aim to grow your SS as fast and big as you can which requires reinvesting every dime into the next acquisition model we're going to look at or you can choose to start taking some profit for your hard work and instead aim to automate Acquisitions and have new users come in on autopilot in both cases there are two acquisition models that are perfectly suited for this stage let's design them in the first one we're going to use the advertisement method this means that we're going to take some of all the content that has proven to work well during stage two and turn them into paid ads that we can scale and use to reach a whole new level of awareness of course this also includes crafting testing and scaling new ad creatives and trying out new strategies for the channels I recommend Google ads for search ads and video ads on YouTube MAA for image ads and video ads on Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok for video ads on Tik Tok again the cost of this acquisition model depends on the average revenue per user your s is generating and how big of a return on ad spend you wish if you're in growth mode you might not care much about a return at all and instead just max out the revenue to pay for new acquisitions if you want to build up a profit you might aim for a 3:1 return on ad spend which means that for each $1 you spend on acquiring a new user that new user earns your SAS $3 then you put one of those dollars into acquiring yet a new user and you keep $1 as a profit in the second acquisition model we're once again going to use the referal method but this time we're not just going to ask a handful of users to refer new users we're going to offer an affiliate program where new users can sign up create referral links and start spreading the word in order for it to work at this scale you definitely need to offer your affiliate Partners a proper compensation I've seen some affiliate programs offer 10 20 even a 50% share of all recurring Revenue that new referrals generate and once again how much you're willing to offer your affiliate Partners entirely depends on your direction if you're in growth mode you might want to share a big chunk of Revenue to keep everyone highly motivated and if you're in automation mode you can go as low as gift cards or unlocking new features or increasing usage limitations for your affiliate partners and obviously this road map can take many forms you can start by running ads from the very early stages and you can scale cold Outreach in the later stages too so this particular road map isn't the only one but it is the one that I have used to build and scale three products and it is the one that I would use again for my next SS now this whole video obviously assumes that you already have a product if you need to take a step even further back I highly recommend watching this video next if you got value from

================================================================================

if you're building a SAS you absolutely need to run AB test sooner or later it is one of the best most datadriven most scientific ways to improve your website copy your messaging your onboarding flows inab functionality and by the end of the day convert more users and make more money in my startup we always have test running either on our website in our ad campaigns or in the app itself and in this video I want to share some of the most impactful and most curious findings we've discovered by rigorously AB testing our products some of these increased our Revenue by 52% and some of these were just weird let me show you what I mean but first let's just get the definition straight what is AB testing exactly practically this means that we assign all visitors or users to a group group a or group b and present them with different versions We then measure how many people in each group take a desired action for instance creating a new account and compare the two results after the experiment ends there are are a number of different ways this can be set up and there are many tools available that can handle this for you without the need to code in our setup we're using JavaScript to run the experiment and amplitude to track the results so let's head over to the lab and go through some test results experiment number one a user onboarding flow on one of our products feed hiive which is a social media management tool we offer a 7day free trial for all new users to try out the tool we want to find out if forcing people through an onboarding flow before getting access to the tool will result in more users signing up after the trial than users who get access directly let's take a look at the variance when group a signs up they'll get access to the tool directly they can click around and they can explore the tool and they'll be prompted to take certain actions for instance adding a Social account when it's needed this is the experience 50% of new users will get when Group B Signs off they'll be forced through an onboarding FL low they'll be asked a few questions asked to add their social accounts in advance and they'll even have to put their credit card information and pick a plan before they get to see and explore the tool so which of these groups do you think will result in the most signups after the 7-Day trial A or B we actually ran this experiment multiple times in the past 2 years with someone's apart every time and the results are very consistent every time in fact we set up the exact same experiment for another product link drip and we see similar results here as well are you ready for it these are the numbers from the last experiment we did in group a 100% of users will finish the onboarding flow since the recent one 11% of these users will end up converting by upgrading to a paid plan after the trial so out of 100 new users we end up with 11 paying users in group a in group b only 22% of users will actually go through the entire onboarding flow we effectively lose 78% of all new users before they even get started however out of the users who do finish on boarding 59% of them will upgrade to a paid plan after the trial so out of a 100 new users we end up with 13 paying users in group b so 11 paying users versus 13 paying users it seems more or less like a tie right but here's the kicker and it's the same every time in group a the arpo or average revenue per user is $22 per month whereas in group b the arpo is $36 per month so out of 100 new users in group a we end up adding $242 Mr out of 100 new users in group b we end up adding $468 Mr so we have a clear winner here by forcing users through an onboarding flow we end up increasing our Revenue with 52% counter inuitive well that's exactly why we run AP tests the results here speak for themselves but why do you think this happens what's your theory you can't tell for sure my theory is that this has to do with what is known in psychology as the effort justification effect where a product is valued higher if you force people to invest initial time and dedication into it I also think the onboarding serves as a good filtering mechanism for more unserious users who clearly weren't that interested in paying for a solution to begin with but but that's my personal interpretation what do you think if you have a good idea please pause the video here and share it with us in the comments below I would love to hear your thoughts experiment number two social proof having social proof on your website is obviously super important I don't think we need to run an AB test to verify that in itself but is there such a thing as too much Social proof let me share the results of an AB test we ran on social proof in a very specific placement and that is the her hero section of our website let's take a look at the variants group a will be presented with a clean hero section focusing on the features and the values of the product there's less clutter and less information to digest at the first encounter Group B will be presented with the addition of these comments and ratings along with the rest of the hero section results are measured by the number of visitors who click any of the get started buttons near the hero which group do you think will take the win on this one is the social proof in the hero too much bordering to spammy or does it help create trust in our product nudging more users to give it a try there's not a ton of numbers to go through in this one the results are pretty clear ready in group a 9% of visitors click on the get started button and in group b 16% of visitors click on the button it might not seem like that big of a difference but fed's website gets almost 200,000 visits every month so that 7% increase does have a noticeable impact so for our our audience this additional social proof in the hero section does seem to help of course we also do have a full section on our website dedicated to social proof alone this has been proven to work well across any tool in any industry so if you don't already have a section like this I highly recommend adding one I'm using a tool called sja for this it's really cool you can include testimonials from pretty much anywhere and embed them directly on your website in a ton of different ways really awesome tool I'll leave a link in the description so you can check it out all right experiment number three the default selection for monthly versus yearly pricing on your landing page yep that sounds about right and if you think it sounds like a kind of weird thing to test too I don't blame you nonetheless we did end up testing this on our landing page you can switch between monthly and yearly pricing and we have as so many other tools at discount when you opt for paying yearly instead of monthly and on our team when we were read designing our website we got into an argument about whether to have the yearly pricing enabled as the default instead of the monthly pricing I wanted to have the yearly pricing on since this presented the discounted pricing point but our uix designer felt very strongly about having it set to monthly by default and of course just like you should end every grown-up arguments we did so by putting it to the test you probably figured out how to set up this experiment group a will be presented with the monthly pricing by default and Group B will be presented with the yearly pricing by default the results are measured by the number of users who click either one of these four buttons and I'm curious which one do you think will win this time if you think the answer is obvious I don't blame you because I've asked a bunch of people what they think will perform better and everyone seems pretty confident that they know though roughly half of everyone I ask thinks it's obviously option A and the other half thinks it's obviously option b just like I thought it was obviously option B let's just take a look at the actual results of the visitors in group a 133% click on the sign up button of the visitors in group b only 4% click the sign up button and not only that the visitors in group b also flick the switch back to monthly nine times more often than the visitors in group a so no discussion the winner is group a today we have the pricing presented with the monthly payment as the default on both feed hives and Link drips landing pages oh overall the majority of our get started clicks tend to not come from the pricing page at all so it might not have a huge impact on the final results but still interesting and definitely worth considering when you're designing your next pricing page finally let's take a look at experiment number four G2 badges on the landing page you've probably seen these G2 Awards on various other SAS websites already they fall a bit under social proof but we still wanted to test this in isolation initially we were a little doubt about how to actually test the performance of these badges so instead of trying to approximate their impact on signups we decided to see how much of a scroll stopping effect they had so here's how we set this up group a would be presented with a version without the G2 badges below the hero and Group B will be presented with five of our most recent awards from G2 below the hero we then have a JavaScript to detect how many visitors stop scrolling right around here we also track the clickthrough rate to see how many of the scroll Stoppers who actually click on these and sure enough there's a reason why these badges are so popular visitors in group b would stop scrolling five times more often than visitors in group a and on top of that the badges have a click-through rate of well around 6% it's not a lot but it's enough that we actually decided to upgrade our G2 account to a paid plan even though it's a bit pricey but we do believe it helps create trust and even though the scroll stopping effect doesn't say anything concl inclusive about the users that sign up it gives us a clear impression that this is something that grabs people's attention so these were four AB test that had a huge impact on our growth trust and performance on both our website and our product itself we also ran hundreds of ab tests with totally insignificant results in fact most test results are like that which can make it seem a bit redundant to even bother but every once in a while you'll discover something that truly makes a difference and it'll be way worth with it trust me and also remember that there are many factors at play here which can't be directly accounted for so before you go ahead and implement the results of these tests I highly recommend running your own AB test first go ahead and verify that our results are also the case for you I hope you got value from this video please give it a like And subscribe to my channel for more content like this I will see you soon for another video

TITLE: 5 Ways to Create a No Code Side Hustle
VIDEO ID: wx5PmLbM5wo
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx5PmLbM5wo
================================================================================

no code is one of the best things that happened to check entrepreneurship and the most obvious takeaway is pretty clear we can build launch and even scale products without having to code but what if you're not quite there yet what if you just want a simple side hustle going just using no code is that possible too let's tap into this incredibly popular movement and community and explore the options I'll show you five ways you can create a side hustle in the no code space the first and probably the most obvious method is creating and selling templates if you're great with the signs and no web development you can apply to become a webflow Template Designer webflow templates are sold through webflow's own Marketplace and typically silver somewhere between fifty dollars and hundred and fifty dollars and you get to keep 80 of that sale yourself this is actually quite good especially since this is passive in the sense that you only have to create a template once and then sell as many times as you can if you can sell just two to three of these per day at an average price of 75 you got yourself a five thousand dollar per month income stream after webflows cut not bad at all worth pointing out that webflow does have requirements and standards you need to meet in order to start selling but if you already have the skills as a web developer and designer this one should be pretty straightforward another way is by selling notion templates you might already have heard some huge success stories like a slow and Thomas Frank who are making a lot of money selling notion templates but even if you don't want to enter to that level you can still make a decent income by setting up Advanced templates for project management data capturing organization finances and much more in notion and selling the template from your website this one doesn't require you to apply anywhere but you do need to cover marketing yourself if we take a look at aslo and Thomas Frank you'll notice that they have huge audiences and that they're very active on social media in the same way you'll need to establish yourself as an authority and educate people on the specific philosophies and ideas behind your templates setting up something in notion is only part of the equation most of the templates that sell really well are built on top of well-known models and Frameworks and whatever your template is trying to help solve which brings us to Method number two creating content around no code no code is more than just a collection of tools it's a movement it's all about empowering and democratizing Tech entrepreneurship for non-technical Founders and creators and there are huge communities built around this not to mention the many many new local tools that constantly enter the market the demand is massive and this makes the market extremely attractive for new sales to enter so there's an obvious opportunity here create a YouTube channel or podcast centered around this no code movement I made my first no code related video last year when my channel had around 10 000 subscribers and I immediately started getting a lot of offers from no code SAS companies who wanted to sponsor my next video I was charging between fifteen hundred dollars and three thousand dollars for a single sponsored mid-roll and this was despite the fact that my channel was quite small at the time and at the same time I started seeing a huge spike in the RPM of my channel reaching as high as 14 to 16 okay quick breakdown if you don't know what RPM is when YouTube who puts ads on your videos they share 55 of the revenue that advertisers are paying with you the Creator RPM stands for Revenue per mil and shows how much you earn per thousand views on your video but all ads aren't equal when multiple advertisers want to put an ad on YouTube an auction is taking place and some topics related to some markets are simply much more competitive which forces the advertisers into a bidding war which in turn brings up the price for showing that particular ad and in some very competitive niches advertisers are bidding much more aggressively and this shows directly on your RPM this is why some channels make a lot of money from ad Revenue while other channels make close to nothing even though they get the same number of views and same number of ads shown on their videos and as it turns out no code is one of these markets where Advertiser demand drives up the prices on both ads and sponsor deals so creating content in the no code space especially on YouTube can become a legitimate income stream and as you saw with my YouTube channel you don't even have to wait that long before offers start to come in okay this next one is a bit more specific but I believe there's a great demand for this you could create a no-code Consulting business that teaches employee to become citizen developers so here's the situation there are a lot of companies out there that are not tech companies per se it could be law firms accounting companies retail chains Healthcare Providers and so on they're not tech companies but they increasingly rely on technological solutions to handle internal operations automation managing data flows and a lot of other things but for these companies hiring an actual software developer is very expensive and probably a bit overkilled so the solution many of them turn to is to find their most technical employee and turn that one into a cities developer and a citizen developer is a technical person who doesn't actually program instead they use no code and local tools to build internal applications and workflows but without needing the full skill sets of an actual software engineer you could create a Consulting business where you offer to train a company's most technically capable employees and turn them into citizen developers you would be coaching them in the use of no code tools low code tools and if you have a formal training and software development you could teach them lightweight software engineering Concepts as a part of their training enough for them to bridge the gap between the requirements of the company they work for and the many capabilities it and Tech has to offer so if you're into consulting or building an agency I think there's huge untapped potential right here okay now that we're already down the agency Street let's take a look at the next one a no code MVP agency let's unpack this one if you've been in the startup ecosystem you probably know that there's this term that's tossed around a lot the MVP and minimum viable product it's the most basic version of a product that allows Founders to quickly test the market gather feedback yes secure funding and get investors on board if that's the path you choose the problem traditional MEP development actually often requires a fair bit of time and money it typically also requires someone on board who can program which can be quite a show stopper for Founders without engineering experience building an MVP this way is actually fairly risky business and that's typically what Founders want to avoid at this stage a common solution is to use prototypes which are basically just sophisticated slideshows to demonstrate how a potential product could look but there's obviously a perfect in between and no code MVP some Founders take off this challenge themselves but there are founding teams who would rather spend time on strategy planning and marketing and then hire a team of software Engineers once they have initial Market validation and secured funding and that's where you come in you run an agency that specializes in developing MVPs using no code use it out to understand the Founder's vision and truly get to the heart of what they're trying to achieve and to translate that into a tangible market-ready early stage solution it's part consultancy part Tech development a hybrid model that caters to the demand of the non-tech startup world I definitely believe there's great potential in a service business like this and finally method number five is building a micro sets using no code this one is where the power of no code truly shines for those unfamiliar microsass is essentially a small software service that addresses a niche requirement or solves a very specific problem it's not about serving everyone and it's not a SAS that's meant to scale but rather it's about serving a very specific small audience incredibly well now under normal circumstances developing a SAS requires a significant investment in both time and often also capital and you typically need to have someone on the founding team with a software engineering background but no code platforms have changed the game with plan platforms like bubble wized webflow flutter flow sapier member stack air table paply and many others you can actually build fully functional apps without riding a single line of code I have a bunch of videos on this channel which I will link to below that will get you started building fully functional software using these tools there are founders who built no code says that's literally turning over millions per year of course those are the big success stories but it's possible and even better if you can capture a small Niche audience and solve a small but repetitive problem using no code you can realistically create a SAS that generates five thousand to ten thousand dollars a month which I believe is a very decent signing up so five ways you can create a side income in the no code space do you know any others please share with us in the comments let's all help each other out if you got intrigued about the last one I put together a playlist specifically for no code SAS development so I would highly recommend to check that one out right now if you enjoyed this video please give it a like And subscribe to my channel for more content like this I will see you soon for another video

TITLE: How I Use AI + No Code to Validate any SaaS Idea
VIDEO ID: aSMxdBVTcLg
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSMxdBVTcLg
================================================================================

let's see how easy it is to validate a SAS idea so here's the here's the problem you already got a great idea for a SAS you know it's definitely something you would use yourself and you already have a pretty good idea about how you would build it you're excited and you want to get started but then you remember something that's where most first-time Founders go wrong either they skip this part entirely and just start building or they get discouraged because what the hell does validate even mean and I get it it's confusing and it highly depends on your specific case but bottom line is we want to see if users are actually interested in this SAS we're gonna build and this is 223 so we have some extremely Cool Tools at our disposal in this video I'll show you how to validate your SAS idea in three simple steps using no code and AI let's get started a few months ago I published a video with seven AI SAS ideas and one of them was the idea of an interactive prompt designer for tools like chat tpg and gpt3 let's test if this idea is worth building step one creating a landing page with a sign up form here's the idea we're going to create a landing page to showcase the tool it should look like we're almost done building it and that it's about to go live soon so let's search for some free UI templates for figma doesn't need to be too accurate just something for us to get started with perfect now let's alter this and make a UI that looks like a prompt Builder something with drag and drop and some different prompt Vlogs that we can piece together let's add a logo and a name for the tool as well and you can go into as much detail here as you want I suggest keeping it simple we're not building the UI for the actual product here we just need something to illustrate the idea awesome now let's go to framer and build a simple landing page for this tool we want to use the UI mockup we just created for the hero section yeah [Music] ah perfect this looks great now we need some copy let's fire up chat TPT and jam a bit on some good website copy there we go we want to make sure the visitor gets a good idea about what this tool can do awesome this looks super cool we're also going to add a navigation menu and we're going to have two items saying sign up and pricing both will lead to the same page so here's the idea when the user navigates to this page they'll be presented with this message we're gonna tell them that this tool is launching soon that they had the chance to join early at a discounted offer and I know what you're thinking how does them putting their email here countless validation well there are no guarantees but you would be surprised how difficult it actually is to get people to sign up for something like this if we can get people to put their emails here it's definitely a sign that there's some interest in our idea but how do we even get these people on the website hold on we'll get back to that in a moment first let's build our sign up form we're going to use a tool called formspark to collect the emails it's free for the first 250 submissions and everything considered if we can get 250 people to sign up as a part of this experiment I'd say we're tracking pretty well this is not a lead magnet we're just checking if there's some interest building a form with formspark is super easy to do in framer thank you we just need to add the form ID here okay now that we have a solid marketing website rated for a SAS let's go on to step two creating some thumb stopping ad creatives that's right in order to get visitors to our website we're gonna run ads on Facebook for about a week maybe 10 days again this is not about launching and scaling a long-term ad campaign so if you're new to this don't worry too much about all the specifics here we're gonna keep it super simple let's head over to Tiny kiwi and put some ad creatives together we need three formats the first one is a Facebook ad let's take the image from figma and put together a nice looking creative then let's take this and adjust it to the format of Instagram ad and finally we'll make one for the Instagram story format there we go with these three formats we can use the most common placements on both Facebook and Instagram these two platforms together are huge if you think your target audience isn't on Facebook think again you can find literally any group of people on these platforms and we only need a small group for this experiment let's head over to Facebook's ad manager if you don't have an account already you'll need to set one up Facebook's ad manager can seem a little confusing at first there are a bunch of different campaign objectives we can choose from and in most cases we want to go for leads or sales but because this is a rather time limited campaign we'll simply optimize for traffic let's give this campaign a name and start configuring the ad set optimize for landing page views we'll set the daily budget to around 10 to 12 dollars under audience will pick a country I suggest simply picking United States there are more than enough people here to Target under detailed targeting we can narrow a few interests for these we'll put artificial intelligence and then hit suggestions to get a few more let's add technology and smart technology as well awesome and based on this we can get up to 200 Page visits per day finally let's set up the actual ad you'll need a Facebook page and an Instagram account this will be the account that the ads are shown under you can create a new page specifically for this experiment so the page name matches the website content or if you have a company name already you can use that as well for this experiment I'm simply going to use my personal page awesome let's upload the images from before and as you can see we need to fit these three formats here so let's replace these to match the other images we created looks awesome and we need some copy for the ads let's get back to chat TPT nice let's adjust this slightly and if we open this we can see how these ads will look across a bunch of different platforms and devices let's add the website hit publish now we're gonna wait a few hours for Facebook to approve these ads and they'll start running and this is basically it before you start an experiment like this it's a great idea to decide some winning criteria in advance how many signups do you need in order to consider this idea validated and how long are you willing to let the campaign run for example let's say that we're able to get a hundred page views on average per day and we're letting this campaign run for a week that's 700 page views I would like to see a three to five percent sign up rate so we would need some 20 30 emails after finishing this experiment if we get more than 50 it's definitely an idea worth looking into if we get less than 10 there's probably something holding people back and that could be an indication that this idea just isn't that interesting but remember there are a lot of factors at play here so other things can obviously influence performance I've used this technique a number of times and most often I run two to three campaigns using different targeting and AD creatives just to cover a few more angles all right right I'm gonna let this run for a week let's see how this experiment turns out all right here we are our ad campaign has been running for one week it's time to see how many email signups we got if you're still watching please pause the video here go to the comments and drop your guess how many sign ups do you think we got let's take a look and we got 11 sign ups well it's a good thing I didn't get ahead of myself and started building this thing while I was waiting 11 emails is definitely on the lower end of what I would consider a successful validation but again if I wanted to be extra sure I would probably try tweaking the landing page to add creatives and the targeting a bit and run a few more rounds just to see in this case though yeah I think the world might not be ready for this kind of AI prompt designer right now so um I'm gonna go on and do something else but this whole thing took me a few hours to set up and I would much rather spend a few hours and a hundred dollars testing an idea than four months and thousands of dollars building something no one wants and that's exactly why we care about validating an idea it's important to point out that we cannot ever be certain of anything there are no guarantees just because I only got 11 sign ups on this round doesn't necessarily mean that the idea is completely useless and if I had gotten 300 signups on this round it's still no guarantee that this would ever work as a SAS business so validating a SAS idea like this is about signals and indicators it's not about trying to prove anything and of course the more tests the more experiment We Run The more indicators we can collect and it helps us become a little bit more certain every time if you saw this ad on Facebook while it was running I'm very curious to hear your thoughts did you sign up and if not why didn't you please if you saw this comment below I would love to hear your thoughts also check out this video where I cover five micro SAS ideas that you can build in 2023 and perhaps consider running this experiment on one of them if you got value

TITLE: 7 AI SaaS Ideas You Can Start In 2023 🚀 (ChatGPT, GPT-3, FeedHive, Stable Diffusion)
VIDEO ID: Hdp30KBXK40
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdp30KBXK40
================================================================================

in just the past few months we've seen some incredible new AI Technologies into the markets gpt3 has a new version of their DaVinci models stability AI launch stable diffusion and chat gpg completely blew up the internet and the crazy part is these tools allow small independent online entrepreneurs like myself to access and build products on top of their Technologies let's take a look at some super cool SAS ideas you can build using AI [Music] thank you welcome here to my YouTube channel if you don't know me I'm Simon harberg startup CEO founder and extremely excited about making money on the internet if you're also excited about SAS Tech and Entrepreneurship you came to the right place in this video we're going to talk about Ai and how you can create an AI based SAS business and don't worry you don't have to be a hardcore machine learning engineer to make this work let me give you seven ideas you can pick up today at this point you've probably already heard about chat GPT it's a new creation from openai and it's just completely blew up the internet when it launched and with good reason it's basically a chatbot you can use to help with all kinds of tasks and it's extremely impressive what you can do with it and this first idea I want to talk about actually came up on my team while working on one of our new products link drip link drip hasn't officially launched yet so it's still not entirely clear to us who the ideal customer profile is and what it looks like and last week our UI ux designer was working on the UI for this product and while trying to create user stories she was annoyed that she didn't have a user Persona to write the story for it so of course she opened chat DPT gave it a few pointers and asked it to create a user Persona and so it did with scary accuracy she repeated this a few times went into figma and created some nice looking cards for each of them for our team to remember and this is the idea build an online user Persona generator when businesses want to understand their Market better in the very early stages of ideation they've opened this tool describe their product and it would create a set of user personas that fit including demographics like education income bracket age gender and so on but also personal values and beliefs it would also create a profile image and a nice looking card that you can print out and hang in the office now the whole team can get familiar with the exact people they're building for while building the product at least until further market research has been done I imagine using gpt3 to generate the text and biography of the users and Technologies like Delhi to create the profile image they have low code Solutions available so again you wouldn't have to train your own models or do any machine learning engineering you would need to build a nice and convenient platform for the user and then integrate the AI part using openai's official API endpoints another AI technology that completely blew up recently is stable diffusion from a company called stability AI with stable diffusion you can use AI to generate some really impressive and super photorealistic images check this out a solo founder on Twitter named Danny created this product called profile picture.ai and it's absolutely incredible of course I couldn't help trying and for just 30 something dollars it allowed me to upload load a bunch of images of myself and he would then train a custom model on these images and generate all these super cool avatars based on my face Danny's product completely took off and soon after a bunch of other creators followed up on this idea obviously this technology doesn't stop at generating avatars there's a lot of other things you can generate which I think have enormous potential so here's an idea a virtual interior designer imagine this you upload an image of a room you want to design or decorate and then the product spits out five or ten suggestions of how the room could look furnished decorated painted with good lighting and so on I think there's incredible potential in the interior design and architecture industry which often uses complex and very time consuming 3D renderings in their sales materials in fact one of the creators who immediately jumped on stable diffusion is entrepreneur Peter levels and he built exactly this interior AI it's the service that created the images I just showed you but as far as I know he's the only one currently working on this so I believe there's still a lot of room in this market especially considering different niches you can specialize your service for restaurants or fitness centers or conference rooms really there's a ton of ways this could go and I think there's a great opportunity to become a first mover in this space though I think it's worth mentioning that stable diffusion isn't quite as easy to get started with as gpt3 or Delhi you do need a bit of experience setting up some infrastructure and there's going to be a bit of a learning curve when it comes to training these models also apparently you can get a bit pricey as well so worth taking into considerations before making a move on this idea now let's talk a little bit more about Delhi dally 2 is a new AI engine from open AI that can create realistic images from a description it's also able to enhance or modify existing images and its capabilities are actually really mind-blowing fun fact a few months ago I published a video where the intro has it looked like I'm participating in Shark Tank finding images from the Shark Tank Studio was impossible so I had to take a few screenshots of the studio with people in it and here I use daily to remove the people and have it fill in the background so I could add myself on top Photoshop has something similar called content aware fill but I really couldn't make Photoshop produce good results in this case dally just aced it right away I was totally impressed with it anyway let's just spin off from the previous idea with interior design how about a service that can give you a stylistic makeover by producing certain styles of makeup and clothes so for instance you want to try something new but you're not really sure in which direction to go or whether a certain style would even fit you so you upload your images to an app and it uses Delhi to enhance your images based on a description with this platform the user can experiment with different styles and see how they would look on them before committing to anything Delhi has an API already but you can't fine tune the models yet though I'm pretty sure it's coming soon in that way you can even specialize and optimize the model for a very specific Trend alright the next idea is actually something I saw recently and I was literally Blown Away by it check this out an AI spreadsheet assistant we all know that fiddling with spreadsheet formulas can be super tedious so this plugin basically takes a description written in a normal human language and translates it into a complex formula this can be used to synthesize data write thank you cards summarize product reviews categorize feedback and a ton of other things I tried it out myself and it was seriously impressive it solves some tasks that are super complex to set up in a matter of seconds the downside about this tool is that you have to provide your own openai access token which means that you have to set up an account yourself and you don't really know how much running cost this can produce so if you can figure out how to create a similar plugin but without having to create an open AI account yourself I think you have a killer business right here and this could go beyond just formulas it could become a fully fledged AI spreadsheet assistant that can help you organize tables analyze data help structuring things in the right way and much more I would subscribe to this tool without thinking twice another idea is to create a writing assistant for a specific niche there are already a lot of amazing copywriting tools on the market copy AI Jasper paper type Mark copy just to name a few so for this idea it's crucial to pick a very specific Niche and then fine-tune your model to this type of writing fortunately open AI has actually made this incredibly easy fine-tuning a model basically means picking some of the pre-trained models open AI offer and then presenting this model with a lot of examples in order to tune it open ai's pre-trained models are already wild as it is but you're basically specializing them by showing them very concrete examples of writing and telling it this is the kind of output I expect it could be a service that generates legal document templates or financial reports or maybe marketing copy for a very specific business Niche if you're not an experienced programmer browsing through open ai's documentation on how to create a fine-tuned model may seem a bit confusing and a bit complicated it's actually not even with only a little experience in programming I bet you can figure this out then put together a nice looking front than in webflow and have users sign up using member stack and you have yourself a great product to start off from right here okay this next one here is a little bit more meta but hear me out an interactive prompt designer if you've been playing around with some of these AI tools you might have noticed that nailing a good prompt is actually not that simple even though the point with Delly gpt3 and chat DBT is to provide a human-like description of what you want in plain English small differences in phrasing and whether you provide examples on a certain format or not actually end up producing completely different outputs and it can actually be pretty frustrating I've spent hours on this and I mostly end up saving my winner prompts in a Google Keep so I can pull them out later but we should be able to do better what if I could sign into a service where I could pick topics from a list perhaps use drag and drop and reorder blocks of elements I want included in the output and then this service would simply generate a ready-made prompt for me to feed into gpg or Delhi I'm sure you can combine some clever engineering and some heuristics to generate high quality prompts on demand giving certain criteria technically you should be able to fine-tune the gbt3 model to create high performing prompts for GPT itself using much more vague and low quality inputs so if you've also been pulling your hair and even been wasting money trying to get gbt 3 and Delhi playing nicely and if you've spotted some kind of pattern here then this idea might be exactly for you I would subscribe to this one right away finally let me share my favorite idea with you don't build an AI SAS instead use AI as a feature to enhance the way your SAS is solving a problem for your users this is exactly what we do with feed High the startup I'm running vdive is not an AI tool it's a social media management tool that uses Ai and we use it for a lot of things it looks at your profile and helps you predict the best time to post we're using AI to perform classification to find patterns in your followers activity and to compare you with similar accounts using AI to build a model of your followers activity is an excellent way to solve this problem we're also using AI to predict how well your post will perform in fact we trained an AI model on hundreds of thousands of well-performing posts in our database in order to deliver ranking on demand so you just write your content click a button and our AI will tell you how likely the post is to perform well again an excellent way of solving a problem we're also using it to generate the perfect hashtags suggest Old Post recycling a lot of other things but they're features you can't really take these out and have them be assessed on their own if still a part of a social media management tool in fact you could take these out and feed hype would still be a fully functional SAS product you would just have to solve these problems in another way and I'm saying this because this Market of AI SAS products has become extremely competitive that doesn't mean you shouldn't go for it I think you should but if all your SAS product is is an API key to open AI it's pretty easy to copy what you do and companies do this trust me both Dany and levels were building AI Avatar tools generating up to one hundred thousand dollars per month and then lenza came by big company lots of money build their own infrastructure instead of using an API and pump the internet full of ads now over the course of a few days they made more than one million dollars per day on the very same type of service as levels put it themselves they out executed Danny and me really well don't get me wrong this technology is absolutely amazing and it opens so many new opportunities but while you're considering these ideas try to think of ways you can incorporate them into a bigger solution that includes other things than just AI it will make you stand much stronger in the market I hope

TITLE: 5 Painful SaaS F*ckups You Should Avoid
VIDEO ID: YsqF2lyYfLk

================================================================================

next up is Simon harberg who figured out a way to hack the market hello sharks I'm gonna create a product that already exists in the market in fact there's hundreds of them already out there but I'm gonna offer a bit of version of that product but set the price significantly lower than any of my competitors see in this way all the users of those other tools would want to use my product instead what [Applause] welcome to my channel I'm Simon harberg one and a half years ago I launched my SAS product feed I and to be fair I was never actually on Shark's Tank that was just me playing around some green screen to make it dramatic intro but I did in fact make one of the most common [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] ups I see with new SAS products not nailing the pricing let's just take a look so this was my launch tweet the price of my product was set to five dollars a month and the logic being that with a lower price and a better product everyone would want to come to us right wrong and this is bad for multiple reasons feed Hive is a social media marketing tool and even though it's a low touch product meaning that users can sign up for themselves without interacting with the team it still integrates with a group of third-party social platforms bugs and failures are inevitable so we do need to have a solid customer support experience ready which cost money additionally we're operating in a super competitive market so expecting to grow fully organically without having to spend a substantial amount of money on marketing it's just completely unrealistic so in no way no way could we defend the pricing point of five dollars per month per user secondly it just doesn't have the effect on the user that you think think about it if you come across a product and they price themselves significantly lower than all your competitors what's your first thought that is a shitty product right most people just won't believe it when you say your product is also better because it's not the impression that the price is giving though be careful here nailing the right pricing point doesn't mean increasing the price no matter what and unfortunately there are SAS gurus on the internet that will tell you that raising your prices is the answer to everything it's not I've seen horrible examples of products trying to position themselves as exclusive and premium and reflect that by having prices twice as high as their well-established competitors but if their products are not premium which most products aren't in this initial stage this will backfire so here's the way to do this correctly you should use a strategy I call lean pricing which means that you start at a reasonable pricing point a little below your biggest competitors but not too much now you should aim at increasing the average revenue per user by five percent each month until you meet resistance so let's break this down you can increase the average revenue per user by adjusting different knobs if you have a discount for signing up yearly instead of monthly you can lower this discount or you can aim at getting a bit more users to sign up for a monthly subscription instead of course the trade-off here is that it might hurt retention you can also incentivize users to sign up for higher priced tier this can be done by offering more benefits and features or adjusting the price difference between your plans or by adding a more expensive subscription at the higher end to serve as a pricing anger or finally you could of course just plain down increase your prices though aiming at a revenue increase of five percent instead of only targeting the price Bond itself gives you way more room to experiment with your pricing model at some point you'll need resistance which shows as a decrease or stagnation of new sign ups or people playing down telling you that it's too pricey compared to your competitors I suggest setting up a spreadsheet to calculate this effectively in this way you can also calculate how much churn you're willing to accept as a consequence of the price increase while still increasing your overall Revenue all right the next big mistake I see upcoming sales Founders make is lacking proper execution and I bet you've heard this before but maybe it's not exactly clear what people mean when they talk about good versus bad execution let me try to explain one of my favorite books is this one Lean Startup by Eric Greece in this book they describe this model called build measure learn this is a short feedback loop that enables us to create something test it out measure the effectiveness adapt according to the results and then take that into a new iteration and do the whole thing over again in the world of startups good execution means executing this model very well and here are a few typical ways Founders go wrong about this over and over they start here in the learning step and they get stuck here this means that they do tons of research they want to do this just right so they want to back themselves with as much data as they possibly can and most typically they end up overwhelming themselves causing what's known as analysis paralysis and they simply give up long before they even start executing on anything and the biggest problem is they're not researching on their own data they use any public data they can sniff up and they try to incorporate that into a comprehensive long-term plan that they can feel safe about executing but they never actually create anything which makes it impossible to determine whether their idea will actually work or not when carried out in their specific context then on the contrary you see Founders getting stuck here in the building step this one is so so common among technical Founders they get an idea and then they just start building maybe they'll make a few Google searches or read through a few posts on Reddit and if everything looks good they'll start writing some code they know they probably shouldn't because lean but it's just an MVP you know just to get the idea down they thought it would take a few hours but before they knew it they'd been coding for a day a week two weeks a month three months of building and not a single user had seen their solution yet they never moved on to the missing and learning stage and now they're way too far ahead in one specific made-up direction that they haven't validated yet launch day will most likely be very disappointing though there's actually another variant of this that I'm starting to see more and more it's over execution they built then they quickly launched to see if it catch us on and if it doesn't instead of trying to adapt to the results they just start over they built something new so they are iterating but they just only iterate on the build step and when it doesn't give the desired results they start all over until something eventually hits this is not good execution either this is playing the lottery it's throwing pasta everywhere and hoping that something will eventually stick there are some big influencers in the Indie hacker space who promote this idea excessively and I think that's why we see a surge of new Founders trying this approach and sure some people really did hit it hard using this strategy and they're making millions today but I would call them lottery winners it's not an approach I would model most likely it's not going to work that well great execution is somewhere in between these two extremes you don't want a long and comprehensive business plan so to a certain extent you should definitely just throw yourself at it and get started on the other hand you want to do this in a strategic process-oriented way and not just throwing things out there at random so do some shallow initial research search set some initial goals and create a hypothesis explaining how you're going to reach these build something quickly and get it in the hands of users did you reach the initial goals you set probably you didn't either it went above or below your expectations and in both cases you should hold these results up against your initial assumptions now adapt and do the whole thing again this one is super common as well upcoming Founders believe that in order to create a successful SAS startup they have to create something groundbreaking and Innovative because that's how all the big ones started right Airbnb Uber Tinder bolt just to name a few they all completely disrupt the tick and created entirely new markets so obviously that's what it takes to be fair if you really want to build a unicorn and take it public then shortly you probably do need to disrupt the market in some way but if you don't want that if you're perfectly fine with building a small SAS that do a few Millions a year then you don't have to be discouraged when you go on search for your great idea just to discover that it already has huge competitors in fact that's a super good sign it means that there's a big Margaret for this and that users stand in line for solution to the problem you're trying to solve you just saved yourself a ton of market research and initial validation right there though I totally understand how this can seem discouraging vdive is a social media marketing tool and there was a handful of huge competitors around already not to mention hundreds of small competing products yet feed I was doing great we have more than 10 000 users on the platform and we're turning over more than three hundred thousand dollars each year and we're growing with around 10 to 15 every single month we're stealing users from our biggest competitors every single day because they're old and clunky tools built on outdated Technologies and we simply offer to solve the same problem but with way less friction and with the ability to adapt way faster to new features and changes on the social media platforms and a lot of users are more than willing to change to our solution because of this so don't be afraid of existing markets and big competitors unless you're sitting out to completely disrupt the industry take it as a good sign that you're on to something all right the next mistake I think we're all guilty of but it's super important to be mindful about it it's staying within your comfort zone and working on the easy things this means different things for different people for developers and product Specialists this means constantly optimizing the product they tell themselves that if they just add one more feature or make this thing a bit faster probably users will start coming in deep down they probably know that what's missing is good at marketing but that will require them to get out of their comfort zone which is hard it's much more convenient to just keep doing what you're already good at it could also be designers who keep redesigning the landing page or polishing their product trying to make it more shiny and more attractive while perhaps the core of the product really isn't that good it doesn't really solve the user's problems well it could also be the marketer who keeps optimizing the funnel keeps running new tests keeps trying out new channels and creating complex multi-channel retargeting campaigns while the product is neither looking good or solving the core problem well but that will require looking into product development and learning some coding which is complicated and hard staying in your comfort zone is never the solution and with today's tools and the information we have available there's absolutely no excuses for not doing the hard things if you're a developer you can learn marketing just Open YouTube and get started if you're a marketer you can learn enough programming to build something really cool with the help of no Code and low code tools and if you're a designer you can learn both of these there are no excuses here though if you really feel like moving out of your zone of expertise will be counterproductive the solution is to go and find a co-founder to cover you don't fall into the Trap of Outsourcing the parts you're not good at it's a trap I can almost guarantee it but if you can find a good co-founder that get the same stakes in the businesses you have you can definitely make it work that way as well so this is the last and probably one of the most persistent ones believing that you don't need marketing and that a good product sells itself I don't know the exact statistics but my impression is that founders of SAS products are technical more often than not and Technical fan owners often have a huge barrier when it comes to marketing their products either there's simply two products Centric by nature which makes perfect sense given what they do but I've also met technical Founders who carry a sense of entitlement when it comes to marketing they're typically the kind of people who hate being marketed at or sold to and they somehow feel that marketing is beneath them in either case telling yourself that you don't need marketing is the one and single perfect way to set yourself up for a huge failure with the rise of NOCO tools like webflow bubble sap hearing libraries like react Tailwind chakra UI and so on it has actually become really easy to create great products so everyone's got them now if you think your competitive advantages is a better more high quality product think again because almost everyone can create one of those today what I don't see that often are SAS founders with a clear-cut go to market strategy their distribution channels nailed down and a plan for scale and yes I'm talking about an actual long-term strategy here not just we're gonna launch on product hunt this is much more rare but I can guarantee you that these guys are going to win even if they have a shittier product than you I can honestly say that I've been guilty of these mistakes as well and the most annoying part is that once you start changing these and you start seeing better results you're left with this subtle feeling that you kind of knew all along admitting some of these mistakes for yourself is actually quite harder than simply recognizing them and thinking that they make sense and that's totally okay it's all part of a process my first attempt at launching a SAS product failed miserably I made all these mistakes the second one was feed High the one I'm still running today and in this video I'm gonna show you how I took it to a thousand dollar mrr in the first 30 days and how you can replicate it by doing three simple things if you enjoyed this video please give it a like and remember to subscribe to my channel for more content I will see you soon for another video [Music]

TITLE: 5 Micro SaaS Ideas You Can Start In 2023 (...and Replace Your Job)
VIDEO ID: uYRq60G5XTk
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYRq60G5XTk
================================================================================

if you're here to disrupt the digital Market of the Next Generation you need to come up with something truly Innovative log into blockchain nfts web 3 augmented reality the metaverse there are so many billion dollar unicorn Tech startups still to be created in this space and if this is what you really want you need to find another video because I have absolutely no idea how to build one of those and also being the founder of one of those companies I actually think it kind of sucks instead I'll give you five quick ideas for a micro SAS that you can build and launch all by yourself and if you play it right can replace your current full-time job within a year I partnered with HubSpot on delivering this video and I actually have a really cool bonus for you but we'll get back to that a little later let's get started if you're new to this channel welcome here I'm Simon horvick I'm a startup CEO and founder and I have a huge passion for doing business online on this channel I'm sharing everything I learned about SAS tick and Entrepreneurship so first of all let's just get the definition straight a micro SAS is a product that focuses on very specific needs typically in a small niche market it's a product that's often created marketed and managed by a single person or a small team at best so if you're an aspiring solopreneur but you don't feel like courses or ebooks is your thing and you have an edge towards the more technical side of things then you should definitely consider launching a micro SAS the first idea building a tool on top of webflow webflow is huge it has a massive amount of users and it's growing rapidly you probably know WordPress and you might also know that some people became millionaires from developing popular WordPress plugins it looks like webflow is heading in the same direction and in a few years we'll have a thriving ecosystem of webflow templates plugins and third-party tools let me show you what I mean there are actually a few tools out there already and they're VC backed and everything this is member stack it's a no code authentication system you can use to create login flows integrate gated content behind paywalls and much more member status expanded to also cover libraries like react but initially this was a tool built for webflow and as you can see it's backed by Y combinator and used by 50 000 people very serious business there's also this one jet boost it's a utility system for webflow that gives you pagination searching sorting lists and a lot of other healthy utilities to manage your CMS collections in webflow also let me just show you this one whist this tool is insane you can basically use this to turn your webflow side into a fully fledged Dynamic web application without having to code it uses a lot of common Concepts from programming but in a drag and drop user-friendly kind of way super cool no doubt there are already businesses doing great in this space webflow just announced logic which is basically a small sapier integrated directly into webflow this opens even more new opportunities to build webflow based applications here's a super quick idea one thing I personally find pretty frustrating when I work with webflow is script management I often end up adding small libraries and dependencies and custom code sections and sometimes I also want to do a little bit of JavaScript to customize some things and this is very tedious so a platform that can manage my script tags and custom code Snippets across all pages in an elegant way and perhaps feature a proper code editor like code sandbox or an extension to vs code that's definitely something I'd pay for and that's just one example there are countless other things you can build on top top of webflow so the next one is a no code website builder or automation service for a specific Niche tools like webflow Squarespace sapier if this than that and so on they're very generalized so a great idea is to make simplified versions of these tools but for very specific niches for instance you can create a landing page builder for yoga studios or hair salons or fitness centers or any other niche market find out what websites in a particular Niche all have in common then create a landing page builder that helps them set up such a website in minutes the same with automation tools you can build a sepio for a specific niche market that covers a lot of Integrations that savior currently doesn't have one great example I can think of is accounting software there are a few big ones out there but it seems like all countries and jurisdictions have their own local tool that are tailored to local laws and regulations for instance when I lived in Denmark I used a software called the Nero now I'm in Switzerland and I use a software called pixio both of them have an API but none of them have sapier Integrations so automating stuff like invoice creation and booking receipts is a big task so you could build sapier for accounting software and then systematically start hunting down local accounting software in all major countries and jurisdictions and simply create automation for them I think I have to be an amazing platform and I would definitely use it myself so those were two ideas that would be relatively straightforward to turn into a micro SAS but in order to get a SAS business started you need more than just an idea you need a name for your business you need a marketing plan you need to estimate and calculate startup costs and if you want to go down the same path as member stack and jetboost and get funding you need to pitch your startup idea to investors yeah launching a startup is hard even if it's a micro SAS but today I want to make your life a little easier let me present HubSpot free business startup kit this bundle includes nine templates that will help you turn one of your ideas into an actual business that's making money you will get a business name brainstorming workbook marketing plan template a business startup cost calculator elevator pitch templates and startup Tech stack checklist and much more and the best part is it's totally free of charge you can go and download it right away I've included the link to this startup kit in the description below thank you HubSpot for sponsoring this video and for creating and sharing these awesome free resources okay this next idea is one that I would pay for in a second a hosted learning management system with an API and a simple JavaScript library I've actually been looking for a tool exactly like this recently and I simply can't find it I'm about to launch a few video courses but I don't want to use these marketplaces like udemy or teachable and I'm not looking for a solution that can handle payment I got all that it covered I'm using stripe and I want these courses to be available for my own domain I'm simply looking for a platform that can handle the content so video courses chapters quizzes q a and so on I started asking around and the closest solution I found was this tutor LMS which is a WordPress plugin it's exactly what I was looking for except I don't want to build my page on WordPress so I think there's a great opportunity here build a similar platform to this but instead of Wordpress offer a rest API and a JavaScript library so I can easily create my own front and then next.js or something like that if it would integrate with webflow using their CMS even better and then we're basically back to the first suggestion again alright the next one is super specific but I actually think there's great ontap potential here build a platform on top of netlify CMS so if you're not already familiar with netlify CMS it's a free and open source content management system that uses git behind the scenes we're using this with feed hype the startup I'm running and it's really cool when our content writer has finished the new blog it generates a markdown file and it creates a pull requesting GitHub for me to review in this way GitHub becomes the database for all our blog posts it's literally a folder with markdown files and we love that it's scalable we can generate static websites from it we fully own all our content and we can use all the features of GitHub like Version Control PR's approval and so on however their UI um I don't want to use bad words here but let's just say that we often have a very frustrated content writer on our team the editing experience is really really lacking and here's where the opportunity comes in build a hosted platform with an outstanding UI ux that features modern fast and responsive editing experience and takes care of all the configuration of setting up in the device CMS so all you need is to sign in with GitHub pick your repository go through a few questions and you're ready to go and then you can still use GitHub as content storage and you can still use pull request versioning and so on and since you wouldn't have to worry about databases and managing domains hosting cname and all of this it would be an extremely low cost SAS to run charge a few dollars per month for the solution I would 100 pay for it now let's shift into something a little different pricing pages build a platform you can use to manage and generate pricing pages so you integrate it with striper pedal and you should be able to easily set up pricing plans choose between different pricing models set up parity pricing local currencies and so on I imagine a tool like this coming with both some basic layouts and the ability to theme and style but also an API and a JavaScript library so you can easily integrate this into a custom front end then you should be able to track and run a b tests directly from the platform so you can test different pricing points whether displaying the price and local currency performs better testing pricing anchors and discounts and so on I'm actually surprised there isn't a tool like this already out there I know stripe is planning on introducing pricing tables that you can embed directly onto your page which is cool but as far as I know they won't have a b testing and tracking and my impression is that it's going to be similar to their hosted checkout which sure you can customize a little but it's gonna still look generic and stripy so I think there's still room for a product like this and who knows you can roll fast on something like this one of the big guys like stripe might want to acquire it I think nailing the right pricing model and the right pricing page is a form of art when it comes to assess and it's hardly under prioritized by many sales Founders so a tool like this would definitely help making the pricing page itself a bigger deal and reduce friction in setting it up so as you might have noticed these five ideas were much more about tapping into existing markets and established products and adding additional features or removing additional friction with micro sets it's not really about creating full-scale Solutions or creating new markets so these were five quick ones you could consider moving forward with but honestly I could easily throw in another 20 if we had the time because these ideas easily come up once you start looking for them in a different way try to pay attention while you work especially if you're using other tools every time you have to do something extra and possibly mundane and repetitive consider if this might be an idea for microsass you'd be surprised how many people are actually willing to pay a fee to remove a small but frequent pain hopefully after watching this video you'll start coming up with a ton of new ideas so remember to pick up hotspot's free business startup kit and once you get an idea that you're really psyched about take a look at this video before you go on here I'm teaching you how you can determine if your idea is actually worth moving forward with I suggest you click

TITLE: How To Reach $1,000 MRR in 30 Days (Most Startups Aren't Doing This)
VIDEO ID: nsm7sgSRD84
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsm7sgSRD84
================================================================================

according to public data from indie hackers on average it takes nine months for bootstrap sas to reach a thousand dollar mrr if you can do it in five months you're considered an outlier though if i were to tell you that doing these three things could get you to a thousand dollar mrr after just one month would you try it well we did at my startup and not only did we reach one thousand dollar mr in the first month but we kept adding another thousand dollar mrr every month for the next year and it's not just us in fact almost all successful bootstrap sas are doing this so if you're struggling to get your product off ground chances are that you're like 95 of all sas founders you're either unaware of these three things or you're deliberately ignoring them in this video i'll show you how incredibly powerful these three tactics are and how you can use them to become a super outlier and break a thousand dollar mrr way faster than the average indie hacker let's get started [Music] welcome to my channel i'm simon harberg i'm happy you clicked on this video cause if you're anything like me super excited about sas and online business but also very intimidated by the whole thing i can safely say that this is how we all feel and on this channel i try to be as open and transparent about my own startup journey as i can and now i want to show you these three tactics that everyone can do and while there are no guarantees in startups i see founders who do these three things consistently succeed in launching profitable bootstrap sas products so before i reveal the first tactic let's play a little game of spot the pattern let me show you a few examples of successful bootstrap founders and let's see if you can spot what they have in common here's arvid the founder of feedback panda he bootstrapped his sass to 50 000 mrr before he sold it here's mike the founder of upvotee his product is currently doing more than thirty thousand dollar mrr and growing fast here's tony the creator of blackmagic he started his journey earlier this year and his product is already doing 8 000 mrr so did you spot what these founders have in common they are very active on social media and they share a lot of super valuable content so did you guess it maybe you did and you're already hating it nonetheless the first tactic is build a social media presence but before you turn off this video and throw your phone in anger figuring that you'll never get this many followers just take a deep breath for a second most likely you're overthinking this it's really not that difficult it just takes a certain level of patience and consistency and it's really about just getting started when i was first starting out doing video i didn't have all this fancy equipment i was shooting my videos on my phone i was using normal indoor lamps my teleprompter was a laptop that i put slightly behind the camera i posted these on twitter and people still really liked them along with the written content i did which i also had to experiment with a lot and no i didn't get hundreds of likes in the beginning in fact i barely got any but i kept going and kept focusing on how i could create value so here's what you should do pick a platform of choice i suggest starting out with twitter or linkedin start posting daily one to two posts pick a topic something you want to be known for it doesn't necessarily have to do with the startup you're planning on building but it should be something that you can see yourself posting about long term jump over to canva and create a free account and find some nice image templates that you can use to spice up your content now go to feed hive and sign up for an account you'll be using feed hive to schedule all your content ahead of time so you don't have to spend all your time on social media and guess what feed hive is actually the startup i'm running i created the first version while i was building my own social media presence i've grown a following of more than 200 000 people across four platforms in a little under two years and i've poured everything i learned into this product that's why it's so popular with our users we cover all major platforms and we're using ai to help you create better content and make informed decisions about when and what to post and here's the most important part you don't want to try to monetize your audience for a long time don't post affiliate links don't start selling an ebook or course have patience and just keep sharing valuable content without asking for anything in return no strings attached instead spend the time building authority credibility and start building connections with other creators and entrepreneurs social media is just as much about networking and building relationships as it is about creating content now while you've got the momentum going on your social channels this is where you move on to the next part tactic number two this is the part where you start building your new sas but before you start putting an mvp together there's a thing you want to do first did you guess it that's right you want to find early adopters while you've been building your audience and creating content hopefully you've also connected with a handful of other creators people with their own personal brands and their own audiences and this is extremely powerful first of all you need users to build your product with not for with this is an important difference find a group of people who are interested in what you're planning on building invite them into a closed chat group or discord server now include them in everything all the decision making big and small you're going to build it but they'll help shape the product from day one not only are you much much more likely to actually build a product users want but you're also building a strong group of advocates from day one consider the loyalty you get from this group of users they will genuinely feel like they're part of the project secondly since it's a group of other content creators and entrepreneurs just like yourself they'll all have their own audiences to advocate to you will effectively multiply your reach the day you finally launch this is exactly what i did with vtype when i onboarded the first users the product barely did anything like literally it was a text field on a grey website and a few buttons it was buggy janky ugly as but it was the perfect time to bring in the first user's enclosed beta and this is where most founders make the biggest mistake they build way too far ahead without really having an idea about who they're building for they think validation is having some users say sure that sounds great while presenting the idea once and that's it but that's not enough you need to keep validating your product i built feed hives in vp for almost two months together with this closed group of users and we talked and discussed features every day if we hadn't had countless discussions in those two months about everything from features pricing positioning in the market if i had built everything on my own and made every decision based on gut feeling i would have completely missed the mark and guess what i'm still doing this today over time that small group turned into a facebook group with more than a thousand members but the purpose is still the same building the product in close collaboration with the community behind it i still have my community to take part in the decision making of my startup to this day it's not exactly the same way as in the beginning but the community still helps shape the direction of feed hive alright at this point you might have figured out where this is headed this is all about being open transparent including people and making content from sharing about your journey so of course the last tactic is building in public but before we get carried away here let me just define what i mean by building in public i simply mean creating content from your journey of building a startup and i know there are people who feel very strongly about building in public and the whole open startup movement and that's perfectly fine now i'm just sharing my perspective on building in public and how i see most indie hackers and small startups using it it's a social media marketing strategy that's all it is you want to create and share content that is interesting and valuable to your audience and which in turn drives awareness leads and subscribers to your sas you don't have to share revenue numbers you don't have to reveal how much you're paying your employees and you don't have to share any secrets or insights that you believe are business critical there are literally no obligations at all what you want to do is to include your audience in the journey the process of creating the ups and downs of running a startup content that is valuable and interesting to your audience you want to give people a unique insight into entrepreneurship and what it means to build a sas you want to share tips and give advice share your learnings and findings as they come in skip the boring and generic startup advice people want to see what it's like building a startup for you share all the unique parts all the juicy stuff and don't be afraid that people will judge most people love it when you're honest and open and most people connect better with realistic and small rather than extraordinary and mind-blowing so don't worry a second about having to impress anyone people want to see something realistic something that motivates them and makes them feel like they could do it as well and this is exactly what building in public is really about creating great content content that will move people that's all i started sharing about feed hive a month before it went live the people from the early adopter group started to do the same when i finally launched we went straight to 300 mrr in the first 24 hours and after about a month we had the first thousand dollar mrr no big product on lunch no being on the front page of hacker news no being covered on techcrunch just building a social media presence building the product with a group of eager early adopters creating content about my journey and building in public then launching over a single tweet the research on the public data from indie hackers was done by an individual creator and the data set was pretty small so of course we should take it with a grain of salt nonetheless from what i've seen i don't think the results are way off reaching a thousand dollar mr is way harder than you might think and an average of nine months doesn't seem unreasonable to me on the other hand as we've discovered there's a way that you can beat this average though of course you also need to actually come up with a sas idea that works otherwise this would have been all for nothing in this video i'll show you how to come up with a brilliant sass idea that actually works you should definitely watch this one up next but before you leave remember to give this video a like and subscribe to my channel for more content i will see you soon for another video

TITLE: I Make $5,000 Per Month On Autopilot Doing This
VIDEO ID: 1Wq5itfNNnE

================================================================================

i was desperately trying to get a passive income stream up and running i wasn't expecting to get rich or anything but you know an income might be able to actually feel and there is just so much useless advice out there either i had to research or understand a tremendous lot like with crypto or nfts or i had to build up a huge stock portfolio with money that i just didn't have so i was looking towards info products it seemed like a perfect fit creating an ebook was definitely something i could work out and people on the internet was clearly making an insane amount of money from this but as it turned out there's a huge problem if you've ever tried selling an info product you're probably very familiar with it when you launch you'll see sales starting to come in but it quickly fizzles out in fact even very successful ebook authors and course creators experienced this after a few weeks sales just more or less stopped coming in i didn't really care about making hundreds of thousands of dollars at launch i just wanted a product that would consistently sell month after month so i was looking towards paid ads this seemed to be the perfect solution for what i was trying to achieve and as it turned out it did not work well not only did my ebook not sell but now i was even losing money but this was where i started to get stubborn about this i thought this was going to be the perfect passive income stream if i could make it work it had to work so i started doing research i played around with the settings of my ass different target audiences i wasted more money i tried a b testing the landing page changed the ad copy still nothing at this point i was super close to giving up when finally and yes the profit margin was the same i finally nailed it a 5 000 monthly passive income stream exactly what i was looking for after digging deep and understanding these results i narrowed down three core elements that actually made my selling system work and here i am in this video ready to share them all with you welcome to my little space here on youtube and thank you so much for jumping into this video i'm simon hoiberg and this is the space i use to share everything i know about making money on the internet so if you're also totally hooked on tech sas business and entrepreneurship or just want to get started making money online then you're in great company here you probably heard people talking about how it's important to build multiple revenue streams and passive income seems to be one of the hardest topics out there the reason why i quote the passive part here is that the idea is being thrown around and misused quite a bit some people use this to make it sound like you can earn money without doing anything in my world you can only obtain truly passive income by investing which i by the way 100 recommend you to do as well but that's a totally different topic in this context it's more about earning money that is not a direct product of your time so you put in some initial time work and effort to build an asset and after that you can make money from this asset without barely spending any time on it so it's that last part i call passive income in this context but i'm just gonna make it super clear that it does not mean that you don't have to put in time and effort to make this work the idea is straightforward you need a product in my case it's my ebooks but it could also be physical products that you sell from drop shipping for instance you need a website you can sell from you can either set one up yourself or use tools like webflow and shopify finally you need to run ads images are super important here so you're gonna need a tool to create some nice visuals i use figment but canva is a super popular choice here since it's easier to get started so users on facebook instagram and youtube will see your ads some will click on it and get directed to your landing page and some will purchase a copy or an item the great thing about this model is that as soon as you nail down something that really works it's easy to turn the knob and volume up sales you want to sell more copies or items you simply increase the ad budget so let's assume that you already have a product in place now let me break down three core elements that makes this system work first one great ads that make people click so let's take a look at how facebook's ad platform works behind the scenes when you're running ads to sell you always want to pick a conversion campaign don't run a campaign for website clicks it won't work nearly as effective in order to run a conversion campaign you need to install the facebook pixel on your landing page and trigger a conversion event every time someone buys your product this event will feed back to facebook and let it know that your goal with running the ad was achieved facebook uses very advanced ai technology and reinforcement learning to narrow in and become better at showing exactly your ad to the right people so it's important that every time facebook sends a visitor to your website you hand them this little bill that they can ring when they do something you want facebook to give you more of that's what the facebook pixel is this is why you don't want to optimize against website clicks and why you don't want to narrow down a specific target audience either trust me facebook is better at figuring out who to sell your product to than you are however well you think you know your target audience so don't narrow by interest age occupation and so on keep a super wide audience and let facebook do its thing this is also why you'll notice that your ads are not performing that well when you launch the campaign it's because facebook needs a bit of time to train the ai will try to make certain assumptions about your ad based on the ad copy the image but really it mostly starts showing the ads to people somewhat at random but by ringing that little bill you'll teach facebook when something worked and it will start figuring out the patterns as a rule of thumb you need 10 to 20 sales to get facebook through training and you can expect to spend at least three times the average price of a sale on ads before seeing any significant results facebook's internal machinery is extremely powerful and once it's tuned in it will start delivering some really good results but it's not a magic platform facebook is really good at getting your ad in front of the right people but you still need to craft a great ad in order to get visitors so here are some things to keep in mind create eye-popping visuals you want something that catches people's attention and makes them stop scrolling the visuals should be vibrant and colorful and shouldn't contain too much text you have around one and a half second to catch people's attention so try to make this test on yourself open your eyes look at the image close them after one and a half second did you manage to get a clear impression of what this ad is about if it's too busy too overloaded or contains too much text the human brain doesn't get a chance to establish an impression in this short amount of time facebook's ad platform allows you to select different images for different placements so make sure you'll have a version that works well on the timeline on stories and in search results generally you want to create three different distinct versions a regular 4x4 a 69 and a 9 16. with these three variants you can adjust your images to work well on all placements also if you're brave make a small video and run this as an ad on reels i've personally had very good results with this though video ads are a bit more advanced and it can't be more difficult to make something that really catches people's attention another version i've seen often is animated visuals in video or gif format so as users scroll by it appears as if your ad is animating into the view this can be a great way to catch people's attention as well lastly you want great copy this is the second most important element of a great ad you want to keep the text short and concise space it out so it's not appearing as a wall of text lists are great to sum up a good deal get personal with your audience don't say we or us if your personal brand use i and me avoid technical terms and buzz words speak in a natural language that people understand use emojis a bit of colors and graphics within the text itself also makes it look more appealing and eye-catching include a clear call to action don't confuse the viewer make it clear what this ad is about what you want the viewer to do and what the outcome is finally and this one is super important include a deal running either a discounted offer or a deal where the buyer gets something extra works really really well it creates incentive you've probably seen people doing this urgency technique where they put only for the next hour and they have this countdown showing on their landing page i would strongly advise against this kind of technique as it comes off scammy on a lot of people instead of rushing people and catering to fomo focus on incentive instead that said running a discounted offer for a time limited period can work well but keep the focus on the amazing product and what they get out of it instead of highlighting how fast people need to move in order to lock it down let's summarize it we need to run conversion campaigns using the facebook pixel and we need to keep the target audience brought so facebook get a lot of leeway to do its thing we need eye popping visuals that make the viewer want to stop scrolling we need great ad copy that sells your product in an easy to read and concise way finally we need to include a deal that creates extra incentive to go and check out your product nailing down the right ad creatives does require a bit of practice and a bit of experimenting with different things and while facebook's ad platform is incredibly affordable this will cost you some money and you should be prepared to throw some money away on simply experimenting and getting it right fortunately facebook's ad platform is a great tool seems like those guys at facebook almost spent more time making that a great experience than facebook itself which i guess kind of makes sense after all that is where money comes from it offers you a lot of ways to quickly create new ads adjust the creatives run a b test create multiple ads under the same ad set to see which one performs better and so on if you want to learn more about running facebook ads please check out ben heath here on youtube he's the ceo of lead guru an advertisement agency and he is a facebook ad specialist alright that was the first one again facebook will only help you get your ad in front of the right people and with a tight ad creative you will now have visitors coming to your landing page so naturally that's the second core element you need to nail down in order to make this selling system work a professional visually appealing landing page that sells obviously this can be done in many different ways though there are some general elements that you should consider including but first of all let me just make it clear that you don't have to be a programmer to set up a great landing page there are a lot of great tools like webflow wix squarespace and even shopify you can use to build something really good in fact even if you are a programmer i suggest you take a look at these tools just to save yourself some time alright let's break down a few things your landing page must have in order to work with your ads yes must have make sure you can check all of these off your landing page must align with the ad if you're selling a specific product make sure that the actual product page is where you direct your visitors if the landing page presents something different from the ad content that's known as a bait and switch and it's against facebook's guidelines ideally the landing page should also follow the same brand colors and design as the ad make it feel familiar as soon as the visitor enters it must be fully functional if the app is crashing half of the time not only will you lose conversions but facebook might actually deactivate your ad altogether so make sure your landing page works is fast to load and is responsive and while we're at responsiveness make sure to optimize for mobile this shouldn't come as a surprise but most of your visitors will come from a mobile phone so besides making sure your landing page is fully responsive make the mobile experience the primary experience make sure it's a great user experience that everything looks really nice lastly make sure you don't have other apps on your landing page like banners from google adsense it's a really poor experience first of all but facebook might actually deactivate your ad if the first thing visitors are met with is another ad they have to click through to get to your landing page so when you design your landing page keep these super important points in mind now let's take a look at some good practices for maximizing the effectiveness of your landing page in combination with the ad your landing page should contain a hero section with a strong headline while you could put the title of your info product or name of the item here it will be a bit of a wasted opportunity since you will present the product including the title and a description a little bit further down on the page what i suggest is a headline that describes the outcome of buying your product preferably using a strong verb at the beginning of the sentence the outcome can be either what you get or how you solve a problem this could be stop wasting money on ads that don't convert or improve your landing page design and start selling more or learn how to build a website from scratch and just below the headline you should have a subheading that briefly sums up what your product is about so a full example could be stop wasting money on ads that don't convert the youtube video that will reveal the truth about realistic money making from running ads if i were to sell this exact youtube video right here the headline and subheading could probably go something like that let's take a few actual examples though here we have robert who's selling a flutter course notice the headline outcome of buying the product introduced by a strong verb robert has a very short subheading here but notice how he's using a video to demonstrate his product which is actually complementary to the subheading this is a great way to further establish trust and demo videos are well known to convert more sales so here we have josh who's selling a css course again he's describing the outcome with one tight sentence here and he's using the super strong verb stop to introduce his headline really well done and joss also uses the subheading to describe what the course is about a little fun fact josh turned over more than five hundred thousand dollars just in pre-sale for this course when it comes to info product he is an absolute elite player let's look at an example here from west boss this website is very different from what you normally see and it very much stands out but again wes boss managed to limit his headline to a two word sentence master gatsby still describes the outcome and still start with a strong verb excellent work and again he's using the subheading to further elaborate on what his course is about last up let me bring in my own landing page as an example here once again you see how i follow the same pattern describing the outcome and starting out with a verb and also here i use the subheading to describe what you will learn from my ebook this right here is one of the ebooks that's making me more than five thousand dollars every month by the way so from here you'll of course spend some of your website real estate to further describe the product outline the content bring out some of the usps from this product obviously you'll also need a place where you can actually click to purchase the product and you'll need a checkout system to handle payment however there are two more things that i believe is an absolute must-have for these kinds of landing pages you need to have an explainer video or a video demonstrating your product as we saw before robot actually added his video as one of the first things to see when you land on his website but you'll notice that jaws got one as well if we scroll a little bit further down we also see that wes boss has won here for his master gatsby course and i got one as well when you scroll down a little further it is well known to increase conversions but it's also a great opportunity to let the visitor get a sense of who you are none of us are celebrities so when a user comes to your website it may very well be the first time they ever hear about you use the video to establish a connection and leave an impression obviously explain what they get from this product and why they should invest in it but use this as an opportunity to let them hear your voice see your face and actually get a sense of who you are as a person you will be amazed how much better your product will sell if you're not just an anonymous person people want to know who you are the next one is testimonials this is absolutely crucial in order to have your product effectively sell ideally you want at least one main testimonial from a person that is well known in the niche you're selling in you can see how jaws got a testimonial from kenneth c dodds who's a well-known author and open source creator himself i got a testimonial from oliver jumpers who's a huge influencer in the tech twitter space and if you look through the first handful of my testimonials you'll actually notice that these people are all highly influential with huge audiences now full disclosure these are my friends and colleagues i talk to them every day and we do business all the time that doesn't mean that their testimonials are not genuine these guys have their own reputation to care about so they wouldn't just say things if it wasn't true but you may not be in a network of creators like this so getting testimonials from these people isn't just something you can just acquire however i want to say two things about that one don't be afraid to reach out to these people even if they don't know who you are a good example mass broad the author of mastering the coding mindset actually reached out to brad traversi who's a huge youtuber with almost 2 million subscribers and asked him for a testimonial they didn't know each other at the time and mass only had a few thousand followers when he launched this book but brad is a super nice and helpful guy and he said yes and mass got a killer testimonial to highlight on his landing page now this doesn't mean that brad is guaranteed to hand out testimonials so please don't go and spam his inbox he's a very busy man and it's likely that you won't get an answer but the point is even if you're in no circles of other creators don't be afraid to try two the testimonials don't have to come from influential people all testimonials are great and as long as you can include an actual name a profile image and preferably a link to a person's social account then they're still good again i will call this a must-have before you launch you need to reach out to at least 5 to 10 people and have them give a testimonial and you need to include this on your landing page alright so now you have amazing ads with awesome ad creators and great copy you have an incredible landing page with a sharp headline a video and a handful of testimonials at this point you can start a campaign and start selling if you carried all of this out you are very likely to have a great start on this business however there's a third element that i want to highlight while it's not strictly mandatory in order to sell it will definitely help you convert more and this is the thing you may not want to hear but here it goes social proof you want to have an active social media presence an engaged audience and great content that relates to your product but that you give out for free when you create an ad on facebook it will run on all of facebook's products including instagram and the ad itself will show as if it's posted from your facebook page or instagram profile so make sure you're active here preferably on both facebook and instagram what happens is that when people see your ad they are very likely to click on your profile to see who you are what people see here can be a determining factor for the success of your campaign will they see a completely empty profile with no posts no followers and no engagement or will they see an active profile tons of great content a lot of followers and a lot of engagement and you in the comments answering people's questions and being super helpful in which of these two scenarios do you think people would be more willing to check out your product even if your ad creatives are great and your landing page is amazing it might very well be that you lose interest immediately simply because you don't have an active profile and yes i know a social presence is not something you can just churn out it takes a long time to build up which is also why you should get started today so if you got intrigued here go and watch my other video where you can learn how i created and launched my first ebook in this video i also break down some other highly effective distribution channels including email marketing subscribe to my channel for more i will see you soon for another video

TITLE: This Is The PERFECT Tech Stack For a SaaS Product
VIDEO ID: SUjTIX0a1PM
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUjTIX0a1PM
================================================================================

let's set up the perfect tech stack for a sas product we want to do as little initial work as possible and use some of the greatest solutions currently available to help us get started quickly and to scale when needed this includes using managed cloud infrastructure so we don't have to worry about servers and using ready-made ui libraries so we don't have to design everything from scratch in this video i'll break down what i think is the perfect tech stack for a sas product and i'll explain what each of the components in this tech stack does and then i'll show you how to set it up yourself completely free of charge let's get started so before we get into all the technical stuff let me just make it clear that there's a whole lot of preference associated with the choices i'll present here a part of why i find this tech stack perfect is simply down to the fact that my team and i have a lot of experience with it as i've mentioned in other videos starting a new business or a new sas is the worst occasion to learn something new so if all of this is completely new to you it might not be your perfect tech stack that said if you're thinking of creating a sas sometime in the future or you're simply curious to learn a new approach then you'll still get a ton out of this video so follow along until the end and you'll have a fully fledged end-to-end sas boilerplate setup ready to start building today let's start by breaking down what this tech stack consists of this tech stack is fully serverless this means that we don't want to care about provisioning or managing servers we use individual cloud functions to handle requests from the client and we use a managed database where we only pay for the number of read and write operations we perform so we don't pay for servers running constant uptime and we don't need to care about the environment where the server code is executed patches security updates all of that we just let our cloud provider handle it but it gets even better we're going to be building our tech stack on aws and we're going to be using a tool called pulumi to set up our infrastructure not only will we not manage servers but we can set up an entire user login system with user authentication and a graphql api to query data and we can let aws and belumi do all the heavy lifting as soon as you get familiar with these tools you can set up an entire full stack application including a secure login system in less than an hour and if you reuse some of the boilerplate code that hour turns into 10 minutes instead around until the end of this video because i have a little surprise for you so let's break down this tech stack piece by piece let's start with the back end for the database we'll be using dynamodb it's a managed database that uses a schema-less structure this basically means that we can index our entries just as we would with a classical relational database but we can still store entire documents in a single field and besides providing a key we don't have to define the entire schema including all possible attributes in advance this makes it super easy to simply get started and then extend the structure of our table as we go along in order to fetch and serve data we'll need an api i'm a huge fan of graphql so we're going to use a service called appsync which is a managed graphql layer again we don't need to run servers we're simply going to define a graphql schema and then tell appsync how to map incoming requests to the data from the database in order to securely sign into our application we're gonna use cognito handling user authentication is very complicated and i wouldn't recommend spending a second trying to set it up all on your own cognito manages all that for us and it happens to play very well with appsync out of the box and that's basically all we need to get started with the back end of course as the sas begin to grow some of this will start getting more complex but really this is all we need to get started let's take a look at the front end we're going to be building the front end in react more specifically we're going to use next js we're also going to use a ui library to give us a lot of nice looking components to start out with i'm a huge fan of chakra ui so we're gonna go with that one to wire the front end together with the back end we'll be using amplify which is a cli tool provided by aws amplify also has a hosting service that we'll use to host the app amplify is going to help us out a lot especially when authenticating users when they sign in to the app amplify also comes with some handy utilities to request data from our graphql api though i prefer the apollo client from apollo graphql to do this instead with a few lines of code we can easily set up the apollo client to perform graphql queries and still use amplify to handle user authorization and then we get to benefit from apollo's inbuilt caching and awesome tooling finally to make our lives so much easier we're gonna use a tool called pollumi to set up the infrastructure in the cloud since we're gonna be using github to store the code we're gonna set up continuous deployment using github actions oh yeah i almost forgot we're gonna write the entire stack in typescript one language everywhere so since we're gonna build this serverless and pay according to a fully cost per usage model you may be worried about the price but i can quickly say that following the way i set things up in this video will not result in certain cost of hundreds of dollars in fact the price of all of this is negligible for the first long period however i do want to say that you can get 1 000 of free aws credit to start out and in this way this will become literally free check out my other video to see how you can get this free credit all right time to dig into some code i'll show you how to set this up step by step though i'll quickly say that this is not meant to be a tutorial per se so i'm not gonna dwell on each line of code here instead i'll go through the different elements and explain how they work stick around until the end of this video though because i am gonna share a link to a repository with the final results all the boilerplate code using that repository you can set up a full stack application in 10 minutes i'm not even kidding but please don't skip ahead let me go through it first and then everything will make perfect sense when you see the code alright i'm gonna assume that you already have an aws account and you have the aws cli configured on your local machine if you haven't i've put a link in the description that'll get you started let me start by going to pollumi.com and sign up for an account i suggest simply using your github account to sign in now let's head over to projects and create a new project aws and typescript will be selected by default so we just click next we'll call this serverless aws react sas and we'll use the region euwest1 there we go and palumi will basically tell us how to get started from here so i'm gonna have everything put together in a mono repo both the back end and front end so i'll just go ahead and rename this folder backend so the index ts file is the entry point for polumi but i would like to put things into a bit more structure let's start by deleting this then we create a folder called resources and pollumi and this is where we'll start so let's start by setting up a dynamodb table for our users we'll keep a registry of users in a user pool but i like to store a table in dynamodb as well so we can add some extra information so there we go we're gonna simply export id of the table here see how incredibly easy it is to set up resources with pollumi let's go back to the index.ts file and make sure to re-export the dynamo id here so let's move on to setup appsync first we need a graphql schema so let's create a folder called schema and create a new file called schema.graphql inside this file we will have the query type and we'll have a single field called getcognetouser which will resolve a user from our table now inside the pollumi folder we create another file called appsync.ts and we set up the appsync resource just like we did with dynamodb we export the appsync id and the graphql endpoint back to index.ts and export these from here as well so they'll get included in the pollumi setup alright now we need to set up a lamp that to resolve the graphql query and for this we need to set up a few things first of all let's create a file called im.ts and set up some basic roles and policies so let's create a file called source.ts and export a function that takes an appsync id as an argument now we're going to set up a lambda function we're going to set up the data source for our appsync layer and point that to the lambda function finally we're going to create a resolver that tells appsync to use this data source when this field and graphql is included in the request there we go all wired up nicely finally we need to create a handler for the lambda function which includes the actual logic for the resolver i'm using a few helper functions here for handling dynamodb request and lamp the responses but i'll include these helpers in the repository they are very convenient alright finally let's go back to the appsync.cs file and make sure to invoke the function that takes the appsync id and sets up the data source and resolver this right here is pollu me at work i absolutely love working with their tool and really i didn't get paid to say any of this it's not a sponsored video i'm just really really into the way they've carried this out so clean and smooth all right the last thing we need to do is to set up cognito it includes an identity pool a user pool and a user pull client these three components are essential for handling user authentication and this is also where things get a little bit complex so yeah let's get to it but first let me just remind you how much it means when you give this video a like it does take quite a lot of work putting a video together like this so a simple click on that like button makes a world of difference thank you so let's continue by setting up these last three resources we'll start by defining the actual user pool here we put a lot of the configurations for our usable like the password requirements and how users can recover their account and so on and we do the same for the usable client here and we set up the identity pool we configure this to use the usable client we just defined and we need to set up another role and a policy for users that are authenticated if you're familiar with aws you probably already know what all of this means and if not it's not overly important to know the details here but we're basically telling aws which resources an authenticated user is allowed to access and again we export the user pool id the usable client id and the identity pool id from here so that's it the entire backend is now defined and all we need to do now is run the magic command pull me up which will take care of setting up all of this in the cloud let's do it [Music] should we just uh delete this one and just do it do it all over yeah yeah do it again right yeah yeah yes there it was everything is now set up and in the first try let's just quickly jump into the aws console and verify yes the table is here and the user pool and appsync with our schema awesome all set up and ready to roll like seriously isn't it cool having all this set up already and just hitting pollumi up every time you need to spin up a new project alright let's move on to the front end when pollumi finished deploying everything it spit out an output let's just save that great let's set up a new next js project with typescript let's install chakra holo aws amplify and a few other things inside the front end folder we're going to create a folder called deployment in that we're going to create a file called amplifiedconfig.ts now we're going to use amplify to connect the front end to the back end so let's just add some configuration here and we're going to be using the ids and endpoints that pollumi outputted just before so let's go to the pages folder and find the app.tsx file in here we're gonna add amplify configure to the top and we're gonna use the file we just created now let's set up amplify using the amplify cli we're gonna go amplify init we're gonna go through the steps it's asking for here for most of these we can just use the default settings now this is super cool amplify will now generate all the queries mutations and even typescript types based on the graphql schema we created for the backend in this way everything is constantly kept in sync awesome let's start building the app so we need four pages to begin with we need a sign-in page we need a sign up page and we need a confirmation page where users can apply the confirmation code that is sent by email and finally the home page which is where users will be directed once signed in so i'm lazy by nature and since we're using chakra ui let's just head over to chakratemplates.dev where they have all these amazing ready-made templates based on chakra ui this is probably a good time to give a shout out to all these amazing people right here so cool that you actually took time to build all these and to open source it for the rest of us to use for free i mean that's amazing so let's head over to authentication under forms and let's put together these pages real quick and now that we have these forms ready we're simply going to use the off module from amplify to authenticate you see how ridiculously easy that was we don't want to bother dealing with complex login flows we're just going to have amplify incognito take care of all of that so the last little tweak we're gonna have to make is to set up the apollo client with amplify so that we can use it to make graphql queries the way we do this is to use apollo link to create a custom fetch function for the apollo client to use which basically intercepts the fetch call then passes the jwt token to the graphql endpoint we set up using appsync i've included this helper function in the repository that i'll be sharing with you in a moment let's run npm run dev and see how this works alright so the page is up i'll start by signing up here now an email was sent with a confirmation code there it was and i can now sign in and there we go it works isn't it just so cool and from here we start building the actual app we can easily add more graphql fields more types set up more resolvers using pollumi and have amplify automatically generate types and yeah everything just works with a minimal of effort isn't that just amazing so there are a few things here that i skipped over a bit fast but don't worry just go to github.com simon hardberg sas template and you will find all the code i just wrote including some really convenient helpers and utilities there's also a guide to get started and if you have just a minimum experience with aws already you can get this whole stack up and running in less than an hour when i tried it after having finished it all it took me less than 10 minutes to have the app running from a clean slate i use this template myself so it's tried and tested so to speak and if you find it valuable that i'm sharing this video and the code with you please do me the honor and give this video a like and give the repository a store on github if you get stuck with anything you're welcome to hit me up on twitter the link is in the description below also paloomi has a lot of these starters on their own github repository so be sure to check that out as well again link in the description so this video was quite technical in other videos i talk more about marketing finances and generally how to run a tech business online so if you're into this topic and you want to learn how to get started yourself check out some of my other videos and subscribe to my channel so you won't miss out on upcoming videos that's all i got now go and build some incredible sass products using this template and i will see you soon for another
