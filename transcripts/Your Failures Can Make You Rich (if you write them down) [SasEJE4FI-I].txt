================================================================================

documenting your business mistakes may be the most important thing you do in your entire business career to make more money after I lost everything for the second time in my career that experience was so painful that I was like I can't keep doing this I can't keep repeating these same mistakes so I was like I have to find a way that I can learn from this and so within the next three months I started my podcast and the intention behind that podcast was that I would learn to document the things that I was doing and what I was thinking about and the problems that I was suffering from at that time and I always thought the concept of having like a Jeff basos Vlog with Once once a week he was like this is what we're dealing with at Amazon this is what we're dealing with Amazon all the way to his current state would have been so valuable and I always had the belief that I would get to that level eventually and so you know delusional or not so I thought why not start now and so I started documenting my mistakes and my successes and an interesting thing happened from that point until now I haven't lost everything again and we've built know $100 million plus net worth arguably a lot more than that but just for the sake of this video um in that next seven or so years and so I've been in business for 13 but I lost everything about the halfway point twice and so making sure that I learned the right lessons from my mistakes has been I think one of the largest contributing factors to me being able to move forward at such a fast rate whether you document it through video or you document it through podcast or you document through written I don't think matters I've actually done both and so I started with just podcast but the ideas for that podcast came from an email thread that I had to myself and so every year I would start a new email thread called lessons and failures and then and then the year and it would be hundreds of emails long to myself and it would just be little little tidbits little one phrase two phrase of like oh yeah I had this interview with this girl she did this thing I think that's awesome and then six months later when I find out that person's stealing I'm like oh that thing that I thought was good is actually not good so I'd have these kind of like continuous open looped stories that I'd be telling about what I think will happen versus what actually would happen and then it'll allow me to have much more crystallized decision-making power in the future because I was like wait a second I've seen this one before and I know how this one goes and so that happened more and more times so you think about like if entrepreneurship were a video game you have levels so if you ever picked up an old video game and then you like beat it really quickly to the levels you remember and then you get to like the level you don't know and then it's like really slow again and it's I think entrepreneurship is a lot the same way is cuz you were like oh I know where that pothole is oh I know I can go get the extra ammo there I know how to get this I know what this director of sales should look like I know what a director of marketing should look like oh I've never run Facebook ads before slow and then you just die die die die and you respawn over and then finally you get through and then the next time you beat all six levels and then you also beat the Facebook level and you're like all right well now we're going to run YouTube ads and you're like die die die and so I see entrepreneurship a lot of the same way but if there's so many things that are happening every day in business that if you don't have a way to crystallize the knowledge to document what you've done it's like you don't develop this repertoire at least for me not as easily because the Nuance of what I remember it fades right I don't remember like what was the big breakthrough here I'm like I just know that it worked but I want to know why it worked so that when a new situation comes up I can know how to increase the likelihood that it happens again and so nowadays I publicly do this stuff through shorts and Longs and tweets but fundamentally the thing that got me into doing it in the early days was the side benefit that people would watch it but the primary benefit that future me would be able to reference back to this thing and know where I was at that time what I was struggling with what beliefs I had and that was probably the one those was most interesting was hey if there was a period of time where I was crushing it how was I seeing the world and is it different than now so it's almost like having a time machine so it's like okay if all of a sudden I get into like a losing streak I'm going to go back to when I was winning and I'm going to watch some of the stuff that I was doing then so I can keep it top of mind like oh what am I what's different between these two things but if I don't have that to reference then I just have to go off memory but my memory in the current state is being jaded by my current situation and so I want to be able to have a source I can go back to truth and truth just being things that are documented and so I see this as a really huge problem for a lot of small business owners or really just business owners in general is that they make a mistake but they learn the wrong lesson from it and so Dr Burgman talked about this where he said it's worse to to be successful and not know why than to have failed and know why correctly and it's me paraphrasing but that struck me when I heard that for the first time and I think the reason it struck me was that it took me years to figure out why gym launch was actually so successful in the beginning now obviously for me I was like I'm 27 years old took home $17 million in income my first year that's not Revenue that was profit you know in my first 12 calendar months of the business like I'm so great um but we are so quick to attribute failure to an outside circumstance but we don't attribute success to an outside circumstance and I had number of things that were going well for me at that time and so it's like I had Facebook ads that were super cheap which made the stuff that our gyms were using super cheap and super profitable for me to acquire customers as gym owners was also super cheap and super profitable and so I had these things that were working you know I was like I'm just such a good marketer but it wasn't that right I mean because years later when that Arbitrage disappeared right it's like is the same is the same thing happening right so what happened is the gym launch had to evolve from an Arbitrage business to one that went off of execution and me basically realizing this like what why is why are why is it not printing the way it was before it's like oh it's because the context has changed and so I became a much better entrepreneur despite the fact that the net income went down and so learning from that is both humbling but also the only thing that you can do to get better and if we see ourselves as the asset that we're ultimately building throughout our lives which we eventually just cash in at the the end and die anyways then making sure that I'm getting the right thing the right lesson from the scar is arguably the most important thing that you can have to move faster cuz when you watch that person Play that video game again when they know the game it's not like they're moving super fast they just don't make the wrong turn they go directly for the ammo they go directly you know they avoid the poth the pothole they avoid the bads too um they they they hit the dragon right at The Sweet Spot cuz they know where it is cuz they died 20 other times hitting the wrong part of the Dragon that's not the sweet The Sweet Spot um and so they just it's more efficient movement they have less wasted moves and so I see that the same way as entrepreneurship it's not like the businesses that I have are so much bigger than the ones that I had before and they grow so much faster because I know how to go through their first early levels really quickly because of what I've documented before here's what it looks like when it's wrong so I'll talk to you know a small business owner and say Hey you know I hired a salesperson and then it they didn't work out and I'm like cool so what' you learn from that this is always one of my favorite questions like what' you learn from that and so I asked this to myself like what' you learn from that um and so with this particular individual he say like well no one can sell like I can sell I'll be like well I think you might have learned the wrong lesson from the mistake and like the only thing worse than wrong like than having the mistake is learning the wrong lesson from the mistake because then you're bound to repeat it again and so a fool never learns from their mistakes a dumb person learns from their mistakes eventually a smart person learn learns one lesson from a mistake a very smart person learns multiple lessons from a mistake a wise man learns from the mistake of others the wisest man learns from their successes too and so the idea is if we think about that as a Continuum of how we can move more efficiently through life and get more for every move it's making sure that we're like that person playing the video game that when we go back through we know what potholes to avoid cuz imagine if you played the game and you're like oh I killed this guy because I hit him in the sweet spot and you thought The Sweet Spot was here but the real thing was that you had a certain arrow that you picked up earlier in the game and when you play the game again you don't think it's about the arrow you think it's about the spot and so then you hit the spot again it doesn't work it's because you attributed the success to the wrong lesson and so I actually see this happen a lot I think it's one of the most common mistakes that happens in entrepreneurship is that people just extrapolate their current view of the world over the mistake but fundamentally the people who are better at business see business more clearly they can recognize the mistake more easily and they're correct because they have a high predictive power meaning if they want this thing to happen again they can predict that it will or what it would take to make the dragon die because they had the right thing which is it's actually not the spot or the arrow it's both you're like ah right and only somebody who's lived through both of those experiences well the next time they came with the arrows that were right they hit in a different spot it didn't work either so you're like oh it's the combination of things and often times it's not one thing it's two or three things that have to happen at the same time for the outcome to occur and so like when I started Allen my third company that I was CEO of at the same time you can already tell me smiling because of the obvious mistake that I was making um Allen was a hard business it was a I'd never been in software before i' never developed software before I'd never had Engineers before product design ux I didn't know any of this stuff I was like I just know that this is I knew the problem and I knew i product Market fit because I knew exactly what needed to get built and I knew I had a whole audience that I could sell to um but here's all the lessons that I learned from that hey and if you're in the early part of your business career avoiding mistakes is one of the most important things you can do in order to move faster not to say that you're not going to make them you're going to make a ton of them but ideally you want to make ones that you can that you can't avoid rather than the mistakes you can avoid and uh for people just getting started in business I run something called the school games uh on school.com um for SL games and in there I take calls I help people build their first business on the platform uh and you can start for free all right so if that's at all interesting you can go school.com games one is software is hard second that you don't want to get into a features war with competitors like competitors in software that can easily copy any features you have and so you want to have other things about your business that give you more of a moat that protects you from just a race to the bottom and a features War um the main the probably the biggest lesson I learned from it was yet again another lashing from the woman in the red dress um the reason I'm so vehemo about the wom in the red dress is that of all the mistakes that I've had to learn she has been the sneakiest and the most devious of them and the one that I've had to learn the same lesson over and over and over again um and I would say I IID say to a certain degree I'm ashamed of that of how many times I've had to learn not to pursue the win the red dress and it's like because every time you know now she's black now she's Asian now she's white and now she's tall now she's short sometimes she's wearing a short dress sometimes it's not red it's it's maroon sometimes it's you know faded mango for the color but every time I'm like no no no this time's different and you can probably tell like if you have that friend who dates the same girl over and over again they're like no no this girl's different you're like dude it's the same thing it's it's like super pacy work girl uh you know super tatted up you know dad issues whatever right it's like you'd run the same Playbook man like this is obviously not work for you obviously I also have no issues with anybody who looks like that I'm just saying as an example and the main lesson that I learned from Allan was that it was the only argument that Lea and I have ever been in and it was actually a business argument which I find hilarious um and she just didn't think that we had the bandwidth to do to bring on another company and do it and I argued that she needed to think bigger and that you know we had to we had to take big swings and all of that and I ended up just steamrolling her and it was a Terri decision for a number of reasons but one of the biggest ones was that my operator wasn't on board even if she wasn't my wife the person who's going to be running this thing wasn't on board with it and was telling me shouting at me quite literally that she she was so spread thin with the current businesses that take on something else would just one of them would suffer and so that's exactly what happened right and so it had nothing to do and like maybe if I had only done that then we would have grown it you know and been a gazillion dollar thing there's nothing wrong with the concept behind the business and often times for everybody there's often not something fundamentally wrong with the concept behind the business like you have some service or some problem that you solve for some specific customer it's just all the other stuff right and being able to recognize oh that is not what a sales director looks like but until you hire that person have them you know spend six months wasting leads on them and then having them fail and then hire another sales director and again six months of not growth because they're not closing the way they need to and then on the third when you finally find it you're like oh this is what a sales director looks like this is what a sales director does and then because guess what happens is that from that point going on in your life you know how to beat that level and so you quickly put the right sales director in in your second company your third company or whatever it is or a new division in the company because you know what it looks like when it's right and so I think making sure that it's like okay I know how to kill the dragon because the sales director can't just be charismatic they also have to have systems things and they have to do both of them and they have to care about people or whatever and so it's not usually one or two things it's usually a handful and that's what makes business complex and so trying to remember all of these little details is so hard that it became so important for me to document those things and you get the double benefit when you document that you make content about it and so you can both build your personal brand if you're into that and get the benefit of documenting the lessons which is the real benefit as the entrepreneur and I find it interesting because a lot of uh people a lot of business owners who make content ask me how do I come up with content ideas and I always found that such a silly question because I I always have so many things to talk about and I think it's because the the easiest thing to talk about is the news you just look at what's going on and you make commentary on it which is why a lot of channels or people over time just divulge into just news reporters with commentary but I don't think that's the right way to do it I prefer to talk about my news because life is always happening and so I also have problems and so unless you have no problems in life which I don't think anybody watching this has no problems in life you talk about the problems that you're dealing with right now and how you're approaching them and you also just do it in in AAR like if you if you don't feel like being vulnerable fine because there sometimes there's things in business that you can't you know if you have a you know employee sh I'm dealing with Daniel who's behind the camera right now and I'm like I got this problem with this videographer you know what I mean then like I probably can't talk about it right now right but if I could talk about it three like literally if we solve something and then three months later I say hey Dan and I we're having this beef but we figured this thing out it's totally cool right and so we just talk about you talk about a little bit in rear and that way you're not risking anything client relationships whatever but you just talk about your news rather than the news you'll always have source of content and it'll allow you to document your business mistakes and successes so that you learn the right lessons and so let me tell you how powerful this is so I had I had dinner years ago with an entrepreneur uh who had exited a company that was an e-commerce company and he had made the majority of their sales on Amazon this is the early days of Amazon uh when like you could pretty much just like list a product and it would just grow because like there was reviews hacking and there's all sorts of stuff and so we had dinner with this entrepreneur and I remember him saying this he said isn't it crazy that you could never have a business successful ever again like this could be the most successful business you ever have and it was because he attributed everything that he had in his life to the luck of things working out you know in Tandem and the reality was that for him that was true and for us it was also true but we had crystallized the knowledge because we had wanted to study what made us successful and so since that point he has not had a business that was more successful than that first one that he had we have had everyone since be more successful than the first one that we had and the difference was did you document the lessons are you just playing a video game that's the same game but you're acting like a new character like you've never played it before because you never wrote down what you were supposed to do when you got to the first boss or the first pothole and I think it's just as important like I said to study your successes and so like our supplement launch for Prestige Labs was probably the most successful launch in terms of like cleanliness like no problems of anything we've ever done and the difference between that launch and some of the other ones was that I had my operator on board the team had been completely trained up we had an alpha phase we had a beta phase we worked through all the Kinks in the process I let them set the date for when the launch was going to be we were staffed up we were trained we had inventory we had everything we had all the little holes figured out and the first month we did $1.7 million in recurring Revenue recurring crazy for supplements and so the crazy thing about that was I had learned from the mistakes that I've done before and so I was like how can I not make those and also this worked out well how do I make sure that I repeat successful actions how do I make sure that I check every one of these boxes the next time because nothing feels like success which is one of Lea's favorite sayings she's like well we have to remember that it took us a year to do this and so if we want to do another thing we can't think oh we just crushed that we can Crush another one she's like no the point is that it took us a long time and a lot of work and a lot of buying and a lot of training a lot of resources for an extended period of time to make this big thing work right the first time and so when we do something else we have to understand that's the price that we have to be willing to pay and having that context you think wow okay I know to beat the next level it's going to take me two hours but Mom wants to go to the grocery store so I probably shouldn't start that level right now because I'm not going to be able to finish it and so having the context of what kind of resources am I going to have to put to towards this gives you a more realistic view of how many things you can actually take on and do well and I think that big picture that has probably been one of my biggest meta lessons is that once I learn how long it takes me to do something well I learned how few things I can actually do which means that I have to say no to just about everything even if and Steve Jobs was was famous for asking his his executive team this he said what have you said no to lately because he didn't want people to just say they're focused the focus is everything you turn away from he said it's not just turning away from bad ideas it has to be an idea that you in your bones desperately want to do and still choose not to because you said you were going to stay focused on the one thing that mattered most and that has probably been one of the hardest lessons it's the inverse of the woman in the red dress for me because there's I've just I there's so many things in like the business world that I want to do I want to try but knowing how much work it takes to make one thing work very well and just take a very long time to learn this um is that you just can't do many you have to learn how to say no and once you do start the game with all the lessons you zoom past all the levels and you get to the hard part which I call the Virgin Territory right now it's how do I hire a CFO how do I do a business transaction how do I take on debt in a way that's responsible how do I scale to a new acquisition Channel how do I go from five salese to 50 salese like what is that process what does a career path look like for a salesperson what does career path look like for customer success like is this is this customer support or customer success like like where do I find a good IT director who can actually integrate all of our systems together but what's interesting that I've always thought about this is that like we were able to grow so quickly in gym launch sure we had the Arbitrage of the Facebook stuff that was happening but I also came into it having run six locations with 30 plus employees and you know eight eight sales guys and so I was used to 30 50 sometimes 100 sales a day on my team and and so if I went to as soon as we started gym launch I immediately went up to what my level of incompetence was or my level of Max competence right equal opposite is I knew what it was like to spend $1,000 a day I knew what it was like to spend $3,000 a day I knew what it was like to uh have eight sales guys taking calls all day long and so I could quickly scale to that which is why we went from basically nothing to 26 million that next year because I was used to that level of activity we had more zeros on the price tag but everything else was the same and one of the greatest Parts about documenting things publicly is that you now become accountable to the lessons you claim you learned and so I think that if you think about the benefits of documenting business mistakes and business successes publicly is there's three things one is you make it for you and so it will help you learn the lesson better and telling the story makes it stick if you just try and remember a lesson it doesn't apply it's kind of like um Elon Musk had this clip that I I sent on a whole team but he talks about how education is all wrong they have a course on a wrench and they have a course on a screwdriver he said they shouldn't teach that way because you don't have context your brain can't remember it but you said hey let's take apart this engine now everyone looks at the engine he says oh I guess we'll probably need a wrench but now the wrench has contextualized the problem that help solve right and so when we tell the stories it helps contextualize the problem that we're solving at the time so that when a problem's similar to that when a girl with a red dress comes up and she's got short hair you're like okay I have one of you guys before I had long hair and the dress was you know shorter but I think you're related right and so you have the first benefit which is that you crystallize the lesson the second is that you're accountable to that lesson because there's people who are watching it who are like hey I thought you said that you didn't want to do a lot of these things you can't be CEO of multiple things right right and so it holds you accountable to that and then the third benefit is that you actually make money from it because people will identify with your values and your beliefs and say hey I'd like to do business with you that if you see that as gravy then you won't lose because you never did it for them to begin with so instead of giving a non- answer to like what's the one thing that you think you attribute a lot of your success to I actually do have some answers one is the time blocking thing that I that I I made a video about the other day which is like my productivity system or something some YouTube headline um but basically the maker manager time understanding the difference between those things but the second is that okay if I can maximize my maker manager time then I maximize the raw unit but now I want to get the most for that time and I think this what I'm talking about today with crystallizing those lessons has been probably the second most valuable thing that I've done in my career so it's I need to make time so I can do the work that matters most and then I need to document the mistakes that I made so that when I do that work that matters most I'm actually working on on the work that matters most and so using the video game analogy it's like if Allen were a video game and I'm trying to win at that game then I've got a co-op player my wife and business partner who doesn't want to play the the game it becomes very hard to win when you're doing Co-op and one player doesn't want to play or wants to win at a different game right and so there are a lot of lessons not just that one that I learned from from Allen as a company and I've learned lessons from every company I've had but not being able to look back because it was so long ago would increase the likelihood that I am forced to replay that level again because I wouldn't remember why I failed so if you had to apply the woman of the red dress to a video game scenario iio it would really be like trying to play two video games at the same time and win it both like just think about how crazy it is like there's two ways you can think about it one is that you literally try and play both games at the same time which obviously no one's going to win what's crazy that entrepreneurs do this all the time the second scenario might be a little bit more realistic is that you're alternating between games it's like one day you play this game one day you play that game one day you play this game but if you you'll notice that when you do that you're kind of like Rusty you kind of like got to like get yourself right back up to speed like your hands got to like you got to learn the key not like you got you're just rusty right you got to get read up or sped up now do that with three games and you're playing one game you know ABC ABC well imagine the guy who's just playing on a that guy's your competitor he's going to not be three times better than you he's probably going to be like six or nine times better than you because not only is he spending three more 3x the time on the actual game as you but he also doesn't have the cost of change and the cost of getting caught up to speed every single time and so he might be six or nine times ahead and you're like how is this guy beating me it's like cuz he's not doing anything else and so I like to think like how would I play this game if I had to win like there was no option for failing well I definitely wouldn't have any I wouldn't be playing any other games I definitely would Orient my entire life around the video game I would definitely make sure that like food was brought to me you know you know drinks were brought to me uh I'm you know sleeping optimally I've got everything that I need my lighting all that stuff would be optimized so that I could just play this game and the people who make the most money in business call it the game the reason the show is called the game is because I think everyone is in the game it's just that a lot of people don't know it and so as soon as you realize that you are playing a video game with money in business then all the same rules apply and you want to have your Prima officially official strategy guide next to you of all the lessons that you've learned along the way it's just that this game has way more than 10 keys on a keyboard and way more players because everyone in the world is playing and they're are no rules besides not going to jail and so you have a true open world game with real stakes and players that have been playing for 60 years who are competing against you and so I just want to do everything in my power are to make sure that I increase the likelihood that I can win so if you aren't documenting your successes start if you aren't documenting your failures start you can also not doesn't really matter when I didn't do it I made a lot less money when I started doing I started making a lot more money and so I would say do it whatever way you can if it's just Twitter and tweeting it or if it's an email chain yourself or it's a audio messages yourself or just when you're driving whatever version of that it is as long as you make you the main audience then you won't worry about the reviews you won't worry about the performance you'll just get get better at it and I think that honestly having done 700 and something solo podcasts up to this point I've gotten better at talking just because I was forced to if you listen to my early podcast compared to now I'm more articulate how did that happen because I did it a load of times and so the same thing will happen to you and you'll actually get practice on making content on presenting to your staff on presenting to your team on presenting to customers by doing it more so a question from the audience is do you see Lila as your guide so I think there's like guide with a capital G and then guide with a little G so guide with a capital would be the assumption that like Lila is my guide in life and the answer would be no I would say that we're Partners we do things these things together but within the context of the story in that instance yeah she came in with the insight and that's what changed the character got me over the obstacle and got me to the next thing and I think we both played that role for one another um throughout our careers and having somebody like that the hard part is just finding somebody who actually wants you to win it's just it's so rare everybody has their own agenda and it's it's how you can help them win um and so I mean that's why I think at least you know husbands and wives have the most L incentives and so it it helps that when they're selfish for themselves like you can believe like sometimes they're wrong but at least their intentions correct and I think what's really cool about documenting your mistakes and the lessons from them is that we give such great advice to other people and yet we don't follow it for ourselves and so when you actually write down the advice that you want to give to yourself it kind of stares back at you and you're like man and one of the most powerful frames that I've had in my life in terms of like navigating difficult situations is if I were coaching myself if I were mentoring myself if I were my own guide what would I tell me because the beautiful thing is that you always have complete context with the situation because you're in it so you don't need to tell somebody to try and get them up to speed you are up to speed but most people if I said Hey how do I lose weight be like hey stop eating and move more right but then when it's when it's you you're like well I have all these other things I have all these emotional charges around all this crap right but if we listen to our own advice most of the time we don't like information we lack execution so the question is do I get just as much value from my Solomon sessions is basically when I talk to my future self which sounds really sketchy but basically just have a chat message thread with what I imagine to be my 80- old version of myself who's already accomplished everything that I want to accomplish has all the lessons learned and can reflect back on my present situation versus what I've learned from my past self and I think that I've learned lessons from both um and I think time travel is one of the most useful frames for crystallizing lessons and getting insight into situations where you're like I just don't know what to do because it's like your present state in your present condition with present influences and things that are going on in your head that are top of mind doesn't but like future you definitely had will ask a different question about the scenario that often times just erases the importance of it entirely so the question was right now what big boss are you dealing with I think that the boss that I am dealing with right now is actually just being patient and so we have all of the skills we brought from all of the other businesses we've owned and run and we're applying it to our current business withth acquisition. comom and I think it's much more of a character trait test for me because the model is working above projections when I started it in 2021 and so I it's doing everything that I hoped it would do and better which Lila brings up all the time and I have a huge desire to with like I have a huge I'm a I'm a tinkerer I like tinkering with things but most of the time you don't need to Tinker when it is working and so I think a lot of times in business depending on what it is if it's not like a lot of things are good enough like if it's not the constraint of the business then it's just a cost that you force the business to incur by changing anything like the cost of change is guaranteed the upside from change isn't and so if you have something that's working well then whenever you change it everything sets back because everyone get has to get retrained on a new process a new anything before it gets back to even neutral let alone whether it improves or not and so I think the the big boss that I'm facing right now is just a skill thing that I'm learning which is just letting things grow without getting in the way and if you guys want know something very trippy about this I didn't start having compounding growth in my wealth until after I started documenting my mistakes and so until I lost lost everything the second time I did not document my mistakes I didn't document anything after that point 90 days after I lost everything 90 days three months is when I made my first podcast and from that point going forward I've spent more time thinking about why did this work rather than really anything else because if I know why it worked then I can do it again and so then I get to like conquer that level and I just know that I can always skip past it if I know the right why and speaking of lessons and failures I just made a video of 13 years of business lessons that I've learned in 90 minutes go check it out enjoy
