================================================================================

there's three ways you can get leads right one is you can manually assemble the leads list the second way is that you can buy leads from Brokers the third way is that you can scrape leads using software for me I usually will start [Music] with Zev what's up man how's it going good I have two questions um sort of both different topics but the first one is more lead related struggling to figure out which method is the best method to focus on so I don't feel like I'm wasting my time you know doing something um to try to get leads who are you going after the three main avatars would be like Tech startups B2B b2c SAS and then really any company that has like a custom uh software so there's three ways you can get leads right one is you can manually assemble the leads lists the second way is that you can buy leads from Brokers the third way is that you can scrape leads using software I usually will start with uh scraping if I can um because it tends to be the cheapest and so I'll use like if you just Google tool 4 whatever ever like what you're referring to yeah yeah and then I'll take the top four or five of them and I'll run my search for avatars into each of them and then I'll take a sample of like let's say 100 or 500 leads of each work all of them see which ones I get the highest response rate and then I'll double down on whatever platform got me the highest throughput you're saying which platform gets you the highest response rate that we were referring to which lead Source yeah I mean in terms of reaching out to the actual leads itself I reach out on everything that sort of ties into next thing so one thing I've been thinking about is you know how you talk about to lead with sort of with value offer something essentially for free so that's like a big thing where I'm just like not really sure how to even figure out what we could offer being that like am I like stepping is this like no you're good this is like I go through this literal step-by-step process in the book of everything that you're saying so it's like how to figure out what you're going to give the person for free how to structure it how to make like here's the script to get replies all that stuff um so the good news is the book will solve your problem but the best framework that I can use for coming up with things that people will reply to is give them Something Free that they would normally pay for so rather than be like I made this amazing thing but if it's the same free valuable thing that everyone else gives then how you know how good is it you have to compete by being significantly better but if you just do something that normally other people charge for even on a micro level and they can ascribe real value to that people will respond to you and then then you're operating on a you're you're in a way better frame and then you can have a much better conversation the other thing was more like on a personal side so we could just sort of step back when you were sort of going through that you know volatility of you had like success then big failures and come back up in terms of how you like structured your life if you did at all so that you P put yourself in the best position to where like you're cutting certain people out maybe you're bringing certain people or that might be even resources for skill development or whatever in how do you go about doing that so that you're not um doing things that don't really help you move forward and grow long-term big picture yeah so it's a it's a really good question because the number one way to change your behavior is to change your environment so if you change the conditions you'll behave differently right like if there's a red light you act differently than a green light and so that's a micro example of how we act like in Baltimore when I live there I act differently than when I move because I had I've had a clean slate like I didn't have to talk to old friends that would treat me a certain way that then I would respond to in the way that I didn't want to right and so first thing from a people perspective like I think a lot can be gained from literally just moving 30 minutes away like even if you like I can't move out of you know I'm not going to move from Baltimore to California okay that's fine just move to the other side of town just get just get out of the micro environment the second thing that'll then lead to is the people that you will frequent will change right and I think that you'll have to get accustom or be okay with the fact that you will lose a lot of friends and that's not a bad thing because the thing is is like if if all you have in common continues to shrink and shrink and shrink and the only thing you have left to talk about is the past remember the good old times remember that time we got so drunk at rippies you know what I mean like whatever then like they're not trying to help you create the future that you were ultimately looking for and it just like I will say that as I've gotten you know further along in that path my time to cutting people has just shrank because if I figure if I'm going to cut this person eventually I might as well cut them now and start enjoying the benefits of of not having them in my life and having all this back and it's like all those time if I have somebody who just keeps inviting me to and then making me feel guilty if I go out and they're like why aren't you drinking or like why aren't you like oh he's on another diet you know whatever it's just like you're not help like just asking the question like how do you think what you're saying is going to help me and if there's like well I'm just giving you a hard time it's like yeah understood how is that going to help me it's not okay so like either change your behavior or I will change it for you meaning I will just not have you in my life the third piece is that I remember there's this video I had just uh opened my six location and I was looking to open 7 through 10 and I had already mapped out where I was going to be opening them for my for my gyms and I remember I did this Facebook live and I was like beat up you know what I mean like I was tired I was taking I was doing 12 hours a day is a sale so I was taking sales sales from 8 to 8 every day and then I would still do the rest of my work before and after that and somehow trying to work out during that period I remember saying what are you willing to give up so I made this live it was like these are all the things I'm giving up now so like these are things that I used to do that I'm not going to be doing anymore so I was like I'm not folling the Ravens anymore so I was bore Ravens I was like I'm not I'm not watching football I'm not looking at Fantasy I'm not going to build a team I'm just on Sundays I need to work like I can't give the three hour I can't do it so I gave up football I gave up Netflix I was like that night time where like normally I like de you know decompressed I was like I don't have time for that right now like I got a process payments I got processed contracts I got filed with leads and do reminders for the next day and so it was changing where I was places wise being okay with the fact that I was going to have a period of a little bit more solitude because as soon as you cut things you create room you create a vacuum but new people will come in who are like in this world and I would recommend just connecting with people online because there's so many there's such bigger communities of people who are trying to do the same thing online versus wherever you're at locally right and then the third is it's just like what are my behaviors what are the things I'm going to give up in order like CU you got to make room like you only have 24 hours right so it's like what are the things that aren't getting me where I want to go and the thing is if you just say I'm not going to do those positive behaviors will fill the gap think for me it comes to more maybe a family side of things like those people I have a different way of dealing with them their family but like I don't know how to necessarily navigate that so two things first off I have very extreme views on this so like just take that with the great of Sal that that you will right if we Zoom all the way out like I didn't choose to be born that was forced on me and so like I don't feel like I owe anyone for that right now that being said I believe in Fair exchange or abundant exchange meaning like I'm going to make everybody in my life's life better for being there but I want them to also make my life better right and so I think the first layer of this is approaching it with absolute cander which is like what you would tell me being like man my dad you know he just treats me like I'm a kid he always brings up these things like when I was 14 years old and he keeps saying oh you know zev's got a short temper you know like my dad says that he's like you such a short temper right he used always tell me that and so you have to reset like you have to reset B like these are the rules of engagement like if you want me and in your life this is what is required from me which is like you cannot speak to me this way like if you know your your big Uncle grabs you by the neck and he's like look a little Nuggie you know whatever something like I'm not saying he's doing that but I'm saying as an extreme example like what would you do there you you're like No And it creates like it creates a moment where they're like oh now they'll then probably try and shake it up like dude I was just kidding it's like it wasn't funny I'd be like it's just you and me and I'm not laughing and it's like whoo that's a new tone right and so like you have to reset boundaries have to reset the Rules of Engagement and then the thing is is that you have to enforce those which means that at a certain point you have to decide that I'm going to decrease my communication Cadence I'm going to decrease my proximity to you I'm not going to be as I'm not going to be as accessible when you text me might take me a couple days to respond right when you say hey you got a minute I might not have a minute right like you have to earn that and like the fact that you are family gives you morally way but not infinite and so one of the unfortunate things about family is that we treat family worse than anyone else because we think that we can't lose them and so I reject that notion entirely I just I just don't I I believe in treating everyone the same family and stranger and then if I can benefit them awesome and if they can benefit me awesome and then we both keep Like Loving our relationship because we don't feel like we're owed anything and so that's that's bir directional though because that's the thing is if you're going to play this game in my opinion this is the way I play it which is that you're like listen I don't owe you stuff but it means I'm also not going to say you owe me anything and like we're starting there that's how I approach those things thanks for taking my questions appreciate it you bet s appreciate you good luck man hey Alex how is it going Selena what's going on how do you strike the balance between offering free value to pay offers like when is the perfect time to make that switch so you give until they ask simple as that you give and you keep giving and you keep giving and you keep giving until eventually people are like dude what else do you have can I get this from you like dude you've helped me so much like could is there and what happens is you'll start hearing what different people want from you and then you'll start noticing the common thread and then you can ask permission from your audience of the people that you are providing this value to and be like hey if I did something like this would you guys be interested and then take a take a poll very easy right and if they say lots of them say yes then it's like now you have permission from the audience to then say cool well I'm going to go spend 3 months building this for you and I'm going to get it to you guys just because you give things away for free does not mean that everything that you do is free we give free stuff in order to get more people interested and earn more trust so that on a longer time Rising we can convert more people into customers a purchase decision it's a prediction of future value right like I'm going to buy this thing cuz I believe that after I buy it I'm going to get in excess of whatever I paid for right and the best way to increase some increase someone's conviction that they're going to get value from you in the future is to provide it value to them in the present yeah and so that's the that's the whole game and so I'll give you I'll give you a different example so if I were to go up to 100 people and say hey uh buy my thing right I might get one person to buy it because I might have caught them on a good day and they're really struggling whatever right if I go to the same 100 people and say hey can I solve one of your problems for free more than one person will say yes maybe 20 people will say yes and then from those 20 people when you crush it for them and then say hey by the way I solved this first problem you now have another problem that's a better problem but it's still a problem and I can solve that for you too in exchange for money a way higher percentage of that 20 will now take you up on the offer and then you get half of those 20 to buy your thing and you go from one sale talking to 100 people to 10 sales so you can 10x your conversion rate by just adding a level of trust prior to the ask how do you come up with that idea and think about okay I'm going to give this for free and you have the idea you have the idea honestly like okay I'm going to I'm going to dive a little a level underneath is that you're not accustomed to the level of work that's required like real talk you're just not used to it and that's okay my level of output and my understanding of how much work capacity I have has continued to increase over time I have put 200 hours into the presentation that I'm going to be giving on Saturday yeah most most people don't put 200 hours into their product it's just it's just orders of magnitude in terms of difference and so like if people saw how much time I put into the things they wouldn't be surprised by the value yeah they'd be like well that makes sense he spent 200 hours on actually I'm a little embarrassed for the guy he spent he spent basically five weeks of work hours to make one you know 90-minute presentation and so I think that if you were to think about like for you to actually spend legitimately like working hours spend 200 hours on making something really good and that doesn't mean making it longer it means making it better and then give that away for free yeah and then what happens is if it really is good people will then share it with other people and then you get double effect you get more people to take you up on the free offer and then their friends send you other people there's so much more work that goes into it I spent six hours a day for two years on this next book I I work from 6:00 to noon every day and then I take my meetings I did that every day for 2 years and now I'm releasing the book right and I feel very confident that it's a good it's a very good product right and so again I think my level of work in terms of hours is probably greater than what you're doing and I have a lot of stuff going on right but you just have to be able to block the time and say the first four hours of my day every day for this month are making this thing and I'm going to make you exceptional and the thing is document you making it show people how much work you're putting into it and then when you do have it they're like like wow she really did this she didn't just whip up a PDF that took her a day I used to think that a day of like oh this took me a whole day a whole day in my mind was a long time and the nice thing is that the the really valuable fruit are right in front of everyone it just has a very tall ladder so you just have to climb a lot longer than other people will to go pick the fruit but it's right in front of you you just have to spend way more time making the thing exceptional which also means that all the other distractions that you're probably distracted on right now the little side projects this is me just guessing right now right you have to cut that because what you realize is the amount of work that's required to make something exceptional prudes you from doing multiple things yes like you can't do multiple things well you can do one thing exceptionally well and that means that you have to say no to everything else yeah how do you find that exceptional thing then it's not that you find it you make it the more you do the better you get and the more you pull the thread on any of the things that you're interested in the deeper you'll go on it because you will get better at it by very the very fact of how much volume you're putting into it so whatever it is that you help people with the one that makes you the most money right now ignore everything else ignore the other opportunities and say like how do I how do I make this even easier like think about the value equation how do I make it faster for them how do I make it less effort for them how do I increase their perception of the likelihood that they're going to succeed which means that you know what I've been offering one product but I really have three avatars and so I need to just make this tiny tweak here so that this person and this person and this person will be be successful now if I was going to lean in even more I would say just pick one of the three and then exclude the other ones just Master a puddle just be queen of a puddle and then you can be queen of a pond and then queen of a lake and then queen of a bay and then queen of an ocean right like but you got to start with the puddle cuz you're like half in half out between different ones figuring out what's my thing that I'm really really good at and like spend a lot of time on and perfecting that don't even think the thing that you're really good at cuz you might not be that good at anything right now and I'm not saying that as a I'm not that's not a WRA I'm just saying like that's not a dig I'm saying do the one that you forget about time while you're doing it and then you will become excellent because you'll be able to actually keep working like you have to solve for what is the thing that I can work the most like this amount of work is required to get where you want to go right to be exceptional and so then what you solve for is how can I find something that I don't mind doing this much work of but this much work is required no matter what and if you do this much work whether you're learning to be the best plumber or the best architect or the best whatever weight loss coach that like if you can do that and forget about time you'll win when I started on YouTube I told the guy that was editing my thing I said listen I'll do I'll do three videos a week for 10 years I was like and then if we'll measure whether it worked or not he's like I've literally never had anyone say that so like right now is just like you have you need a perspective shift thank you so much for the opportunity and thank you so much for the answer Joe what's up man how are you doing Alex nice to meet you nice to meet you too awesome uh my name's Joe I'm in the gym space I'm in the brick and Water Gym space the space you move I know some stuff about it I know some stuff about it and uh I'm one of those guys who uh read gym launch a couple years too late I'm a little older so I made all the same all the mistakes you talking uh talked about when I felt like when I read the book I felt like I was reading Deja Vu I was like oh my God all these things happen to me so my question to you is um me and my business partner Dan are launching a series of semi-private personal training Studios we're still in that space and we're launching one shortly and so using the hundred million leads book that's coming out and some of the stuff from JY launch and hundred million do offers what would you do to launch a gym our plan every six months for the next few years uh you know until we get a number that we're happy with and we keep getting fun my my preference my preferred model is one of two right now you're already doing one of them so I won't even get into the other one but I love the semi-private model um I love that like $300 $400 a month price point um two to three times a week um I like going after avatars that have a little bit more money specifically uh because for them you know they're not going to not pay during the holidays you know what I mean like for them they're not going to be like you know Breaking the Bank over 300 bucks um and the nice thing and I think this is this is I I got this from Rick rck uh Rick Mayo of alloy um that model allows you to get to about 5 600,000 a year with you know 1,200 s feet, 1400 ft like super small footprint um and a single manager who's got maybe 10 20% profit share maybe like 40 50k base and two helpers right so it's a very simple lean model uh one on six one on eight depending on how you want to do it um and you all you have to do is get to 120ish uh at the location and it's usually 50% margin I mean I I have over time simplified and simplified the model so that there's just so little operational complexity so that you can scale and because of are you familiar with dumb Bar's number yeah so the reason I like this model is that like most micro gims cap at 120 to 150 and it's because the systems required to purposely manufacture human connection become significantly more complex as you cross that barrier right and so rather than create this very very complex machine to make it run at 600 you know service based members I'd rather just have a model that runs very profitably at 120 to 150 members and so um lead gen perspective number one is that I would do a three-month uh pre-launch number two is that I would disproportionately spend on the launch so I would I would put like 30 grand um into the pre-sales and I would open at full capacity the best Jim franch rches know how to pre-sell so that they are in the Black in the first month and like every time I opened a new location like it was the first location was the one that I didn't learn I learned the lesson on my first one because I thought I was trying to get it open as fast as possible so I could make money but with everyone after that I tried to do pre-sales as long as possible so I could make all this money and not have to pay any expenses and so that way you can also Focus too cuz you can just sell for 3 months do nothing but work leads and and close contracts and then after that you I'm sure you're what's your turn right now for semis uh right now only about 5% okay I mean I I would shoot for three you know what I mean but five's okay um you know if you've got let's let's just say five right and you're you got 120 members it's six members a month you got to replace like it's just like it it's so easy to replace that um and just expect like if if you have and what's your price point monthly uh about 400 okay so 400 so that's an 8K LTV right in terms of Revenue you're not profit but like 8K LTV like you should be able to spend 500 bucks to a Car customer and not even sweat on it and so like if you pay up to 100 bucks a lead local so that you can close 20% of those into contracts I'm not saying those are good numbers I'm saying those are exaggeratedly bad numbers you still be fine right because even if you had to close Six customers the month it's three grand a month in ads just to maintain it's nothing now in Jim want you talk about you know doing your six week transformation do you still recommend that as the primary giveway because that's best has been the rapper can change you know what I mean like I always call it's just wrapping paper on the present but like we're still doing nutrition we're still doing workouts so like whether I do you know 6 week 42 days 21 days 28 days you know belly fat blast meta metabog reset like you know slim by Halloween you know Lean by Halloween you know what it is slim for Santa you know big booty boot CIP free sixe challenge 42-day detox like a done them all like at the end of the day like all of those are rappers that you rotate locally just so that your ads don't fatigue but you want to always push it into the same sales process so that the Ops don't change so it's like the ad will change and then you get on the phone you're like hey what made you sign up for insert name of promotion they're going to be like well I'm kind of overweight and you're like great what have you done so far right and you start going through it so my second question is you know with a business partner who you know we have kind of like a different personalties we work really great together 17 years of a great partnership how do we how do you manage what would you recommend my my preferred mode is take risk scale fast like we we have momentum we're maxed out in both our other gyms we have a great local rep reputation and recognition and I'm like let's do you know let's do 10 of these in the next like three years and he's like loose his mind over it like he's more of a pro it guy in your experience you know what's better you know speed yeah or or or prove it you're both right a good partnership has a yes man and a and a no man right and so like in my Dynamic with Lila it's like I'm yes she's no right and that's basically how everything gets managed if it were up to me we joke like we would have a 100 businesses if we're up to her we'd have none he says no because he's knows how much work it is right like if you're the promoter and the you know CEO whatever you want to call it then there's usually more like strategic works or leadership stuff but in terms of like daytoday they usually bear the brunt of the work and so it costs more to them it's more painful and so I'll I'll give you my advice from what I would do having now worked with an implementer for a long time is I say what would you need to see for us to be for you to feel comfortable with us doing that and then she'll say here's the checklist if you do these things and you make sure these are the things that are that are done we can do the next one and then that way we have an agreement and it's like and to be clear if we do the same checklist at location three you feel good again like yeah I'm good again if we have these things and so and then you're and then you're aligned and then it's like cool let's just keep the party going that's perfect yeah that's great that's great advice thank you so much I'm really excited book and and and grateful for everything you've given out to the community of strength for sure appreciate it man thanks Joe Nicole what's up I don't know if you remember me we met at Eric Su yeah Mastermind so since then I started a podcast um doing pretty well I made most my money as a Creator doing brand deals so for example I was big in in the crypto space the second I started my podcast I had like a six-figure deal which coming to an end I don't think it's going to be renewed everyone that I everyone that I talk to is like Nicole you've grown on all these social Pages um not just my personal but like you know other brands that where I'm like curating other people's content and everyone's like it's a no brainer do a newsletter um i t i to sill Bloom for example you know who sells ads in his and that's his his model um but you know then I also heard you say recently that like subscribers and followers don't really mean anything like they're a vanity metric and you're like the game is now click retain reward what exactly does that look like because I like it's like currently I have nothing to sell you you're good you're good so it's it's it's two separate applications so from the grow perspective like growing the audience getting more people to see your stuff like that in that world subscribers I mean Tik Tok has changed the game in terms of how all the algorithms work right like right now if you have 10 million subscribers on YouTube if your next video sucks it's not going to get views period yeah it works same thing with Instagram you see people with 10 million per you know 10 million accounts make a post and it's got 300 likes on it right um it's because on the flip side though it's good for new creators because you can come on with zero followers make a banging video and get 10 million views right and I I actually think it's good thing for everyone because it equalizes the playing field it makes content King like the quality of what you put out which I'm always down to compete on that and so um so that's from the growth perspective from uh building out a newsletter like one is top of funnel the newsletter subscribers I mean that like those are customers you know what I mean and so I I'm in no way against having you know a new a newsletter of any sort that provides value especially to a nich audience cuz um a buddy of mine um has a ton of data on on subscriber stuff and like the ones that do the best in terms of LTV and whatnot are typically uh hyper Niche and high value so usually a little bit higher price point um but very specific to like the because they are so Niche they can provide an EXT like a lot of value to a person versus being like super wide it's very hard to provide tremendous value to everyone right it's kind of like Elon Musk thing of like you can either provide a little bit of value to a lot of people or a lot of value to a few people and so I think if you feel like you're better at a specific Niche I I think I think it makes sense for you to go top of funnel is just get really good at making content and then that just converts into your subscriber network uh so your newsletter and then you sell ads to the newsletter if you want to from an endorsement perspective you can also have your own products if you want to um but you just become a media business at that point which is fine I mean I'm I'm a big fan of media businesses okay that's really helpful the other question that I had your Dynamic is so different than what we we've seen in like traditional relationships yet it still works and you guys kill it so what what's that Dynamic like and how is it different and why do you feel like you guys Thrive we set out to solve a different problem with our relationship and so I think that the premise that most people come into the relationship with is different than how Lea and I approach the relationship and I think that's where I think fundament like you know like when you're solving a business problem I'm sure you probably asked this it's like what problem are we solving right it's like the first question you ask is like what problem are we solving and so most people don't even a ask that but B if they do ask that um they're usually trying to solve a different thing they're like I want to have lots of romance and this big Hollywood love which from everything that I know is something that is shortlived and then disappears and then you were left with someone that you were looking at and you're like well what do we have in common right and so Lea and I had both rode that that roller coaster multiple times before and we like and we both were at a point where we're like you know what and mind you I was very you know dejected at the time when I met her I was like listen I'm not trying to do anything I'm trying to build this this is what I'm doing and the first 30 dates we had were 30 days in a row where after our first date where we went to frozen yogurt the next date was not a date I was like I'm going to be working from 9:00 until I go to sleep so if you want to work with me you can and so that was what we did every single day is that I was like like I'm going to be working if you've got work we can work together and so it ended up just being somebody that I enjoyed a lot spending a lot of time with and the romance stuff honestly I feel like didn't really like kick in until like 2 and 1/2 years into our marriage and I think that our relationship was based on that like respect was first and then we learned the love part it's very hard to learn respect being hot or being physically attracted to somebody I feel like is the it's the ticket of Entry it's not like I see a lot of successful guys go find the the Instagram model I meet said Instagram model and I'm like how do you live like this like I would I would kill myself if I had to talk to this person every day right and they're like oh the secret is I don't talk to him I'm like that sounds horrible right and so again it's like they were solving a different problem and so for me my goal is always has always been number one like where I want to go right and having somebody who wants to go that way with you because I was engaged prior to Leila right wonderful girl um but we ultimately ended up deciding to cut it off because we simply had different goals for our lives she was like I want to do this and I was like I don't want to do that and it was like what are you going to do and we're like maybe you're a great person and I'm a great person we're just not necessarily like meant to be and that's okay because I think on some level like we say these things like non-negotiables but then we negotiate and so it's like either it's a non-negotiable or it is negotiable and for me it's like where I want to go is not negotiable so it's like I have these goals which is where I want to go my values which is how I want to get there and then lifestyle which what are my interests right and if I can find somebody who wants to go the same place the same way and have and likes doing the daytoday the same way as me then I'm good like the fact that Lela was into fitness was like great I go to the gym too you go to the gym like it's not going to be weird you're not going to be like oh I don't want to you know like she's in the same mindset of that right if I'm like hey I want to go invest in this Workshop or something she's not going to be like I can't believe we're spending $110,000 on this it's like that that person who would say that is not my partner and I think um in terms of me being the guy telling you what like the number one thing that attracted me about ilila was that Lea never tried to change me if you want to do big things then whoever is going to come along with you has to be equally big as a person and I think a lot of people settle for a $45,000 employee I mean and you can even it's if someone in the reverse if I were you and someone's like man I'm looking for a wife and I'd be like what are you looking for out of a wife like talk like not politically correct like what are you actually looking for and so then if they're like man I would love if someone cooked and clean and and fed me and and washed my clothes and iron and blah blah blah blah blah you're like okay question if I paid someone $45,000 a year to do that professionally then what would our relationship be cuz that that's an expense you know what I mean like we can just write the check and like all those things are solved so like now whaty Andy what's up man what is up Miss Mr Alex Hermos okay so question I have for you I've heard you talk a lot about investing in the S&amp;P me instead of the S&amp;P index like the Mi 500 right what would you say with those skill Acquisitions like which skills and in what order would you suggest maybe a person to go through because that kind of ties into your skill stacking is there a methodical way that you think yeah this naturally ascends to the next one I would think about it from the order of how you would actually make money so it's like well I have to have something to sell right so you have to have some sort of Base skill that you could sell if you're going to get into services or have some sort of based product right once you know how to do that so like if you're getting into e-commerce you have to build a store talk to manufacturers make the thing that you're going to sell step one on the services side it'd be like what's the key skill that I'm going to acquire to show people how to do it and you can acquire that skill by like working a job buying a certification going through a course going to a workshop like I learned I learned how to run Facebook ads at a workshop you know what I mean it cost me three grand um at the end of the workshop I know how to run Facebook ads and so and that $3,000 has made me many more than $3,000 over the rest of my career so point being first thing you start with the thing right the second thing you're going to do is that you have to focus on promotion so it's going to be advertising and if you think about this is the order I did the books right offers is what answers the question what do I sell and leads answers the question who do I sell it to right so like once you have the thing then you got to go sell the thing and let people know about it and you have to advertise and so that is that is that would be the second big skill stack the third one would would be conversion which is like kind of persuasion so sales and there's different ways you can do it so like you could learn how to build you know shopping pages in e-commerce that convert you could take phone sales you can learn how to to pitch and make vsls all of those things and then finally if you want to like learn the next piece would be leadership and operations because then you're going to have to hire people to help you out with the the caliber of people you work with and the different levels that they're at has there been anything that you would say maybe is the common one or two missing principles that most business owners are not doing or if it's maybe questions that they're not quite asking that you like sometimes if you're only to do like the one or two things not that they're not all important what are they yeah so I I just did a tweet the other day but like the difference between you know a thousand and a million uh is skills right the difference between a million and 100 million is character difference between 100 million and a billion in my opinion we'll see if it works is time uh and so once you have the base skills then it's really becomes about who the person is and so as you scale up the speed of scaling often correlates with the speed of talent recruitment because if you are a shitty person or a shitty boss or a bad leader or can't have cast division or can't explain why this is going to benefit a lot of people not just inside the business but also outside the business then you're not going to get the best people and if you don't have the best people you have to work overtime and then you never really able to pull yourself out of the business and so you can measure the qual you know the size and the scalability of the company by the talent that they can attract like there's a reason that Google and meta and Goldman Sachs and all of these ones pull from from all the Harvard you know all the IV League schools and all that stuff and you know we make fun of those people but they also make all of the money and so it's because they go they have a brand and they have a huge pipeline of uh training that they train people on and people also know that when they go to that brand Goldman Sach McKenzie whatever that they're going to be able to go and do whatever they want afterwards and so like what happens is you realize that there's a two-sided funnel right so on one side you have to learn how to attract customers but on the other side you have to learn how to attract talent because if you just only know how to track customers then everything always breaks and you can never get over the hump and you can never scale brilliant brilliant man well man thank you for reaching back and helping all of us go forward and taking the shortcut uh how would you approach creating strategies to generate leads and cultivate enduring customer relationships in this rapidly evolving Enterprise B2B landscape right when I say Enterprise let me clarify I'm speaking to Fortune 500 uh Global 2000 type organizations I'll tell you two very different things um on one hand I've got a buddy who sells only to Fortune 100 um and he was telling me that one of their most profitable strategies was hiring people from The Fortune 100 in the Departments that they're trying to get on board and then they hire them and they already have all the sway all the influence all the no all the knoow and then they can bring that account with them and then the major majority of their revenue actually just comes from cross- selling all the different uh markets that those people are in right so it's like okay I had to start with you know Google Southwest whatever right and then I have then I'm moving on to Google Mexico Google latam or whatever right um and so those are the two biggest areas of expansion from that perspective um in terms of the Legion like I don't think the legion really changes very much I think more or less it's just how quickly can I involve as many stakeholders as possible and make sure that my pitch is oriented to them looking good and them having no risk in terms of their job it's like here's my path to you getting promoted in a raise and here's there's no downside like it's all about them you know what I mean but I think I think part of it is like and I'm assuming you're a leader in the company um I think a lot of it is really getting the commission breath out of the sales guys um and oh this is like I'm getting into tactics but um is you know I love the term bam f right book a meeting from a meeting which is that we never have anyone falling through the cracks like we always know what we're doing to move the ball forward and I think some guys get tired or they I don't want to say lazy but like they get tired and they're like yeah I'm waiting for a response from that it's like well when are when are you meeting with them it's like well I'm waiting for the response it's like if you're not if you're not able to push the ball forward from one meeting to the next like that in my opinion is a loss like that's a that's like a missale even though maybe you could save it but you can dramatically decrease inrease the pipeline because even setting the frame with the Enterprise sale of listen normal Enterprise sales take 12 months 18 months 6 months depending on the thing that you're selling if you explain to the prospect you're like listen it actually doesn't take 12 months it takes 48 hours hours of work not time so if we have 48 1hour meetings to get this done we can just take that and we can stretch it over 2 years or we can do it in three 3 months it's really up to you and I think even just setting that breaks a little bit of the like this feels fast kind of language that a lot of like more corporate people will use and then making sure that the bean counters who are approving budget like hey I'm just being real um yeah that that that their asses are covered and that they can look good yeah for sure no it's all good feedback my friend so uh just quick follow-up question then I'll let you go regarding lead gen specific you know the companies we can compete against you're very familiar with MacKenzie exent right it seems like a lot of Le gen is based on content specifically gated content um and you know part of your value equation that I really like is you know value on the front end which is kind of difficult at the Enterprise level um any thoughts there moving forward is that do you see that you know kind of staying the same maintaining that I think that's 100% yeah I mean I think it's the same reason McKenzie for example puts out all those white papers and Goldman Sachs put all their industry analysis out right and you opt in you get it and then they'll follow up with you and I think I mean I mean in my opinion this may be an oversimplification but I'm a simple guy like I'll I'll get the name from anywhere in the org that that downloads the thing that's valuable for them and then that's where the scripting comes in of the Judo of like hey you got this thing what are you getting this thing for well we're working on this initiative whatever it's like well like what's you know you get into s like you get into sales like what's the objective what are you guys trying to do cool who else is involved and then you start then you start moving your away through the YG so I want to pull the thread from wherever I can or sorry get the thread and then just start pulling my way no that's that's great stuff man I really appreciate it uh looking forward to the new release on Saturday man thanks brother I appreciate your time
