================================================================================

In the last 36 months, I've taken $37.9 million in dividends out of my business. All right? So, that's not business sales. That's not anything else. That's 39 37.9 million in dividends I've taken out in the last 36 months. And I wanted to lead with that mostly because I thought it would make the video a hell of a lot more interesting. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Alex Rosie. I own.com. Today I wanted to talk to you uh because I had a really interesting conversation with a um a couple uh that's an entrepreneurial couple and I caught myself uh in this tirade, this rant about uh passive income and uh how it's not as cool as people think it is. And uh I wrote down some of the notes after the dinner uh and I thought I would share it with you because I think that passive income is one of these things that people talk about all the time. It's the great a great headline for uh YouTube videos and clickbait and all this crap. And the thing is is that number one, 99.9% of people will never have true passive income or passive income as you know in a m in any material amount. If you own stocks and you get dividends from those stocks, then that is truly passive. But if all you do is actively manage your passive dividend stocks, then you have active income. And so what I want to do in this video hopefully is make active income great again. All right, Active Income's gotten a really ugly name. All right, let's be real. A lot of people are like, "Ah, you have a job." You know what's real? Everyone has a job and everyone trades the exact same currency for the exact same output. We trade time for money. The only difference is that some of us have more leverage that we with which we trade that time for more money. But at the end of the day, we are always trading time for money. Period. I don't care what anyone says. Passive just means you trade a smaller percentage. And so rather than the and if you've watched my billionaire mental models video, then you'll you'll find this familiar. We like to speak in the binary of active versus passive when in reality is how passive or how active is this income stream. Ah, interesting. And what I want to do today is make an interesting argument for you about why I think passive income blows. All right. So, let us begin. Number one, I live in a building right now of almost exclusively eight figure, nine figure, and 10 figure entrepreneurs. So, that's 10 figures being billionaires, 100 millionaires, and decimillionaires. And I will tell you this, having now seen especially lots of guys uh who are in that category who are 40, 50, sometimes 60 years old. Observation number one, we are not meant to not work. We are not meant to not work. We are meant to work. All right. Seeing these dudes pursue a pleasurefilled life or a pleasure- seeeking life uh is one of the saddest things that you can possibly imagine. It is the weirdest thing. It's like seeing a tiger defanged, right? It's like it's it's it's not good. These guys are gladiators. These are guys who know how to win in the arena. And I'm not trying to project my desires onto their lives. It's their choice. They can do whatever they want. But me as a passive observer of looking at people that I believe car have a lot of similar character traits to me, I see a different different paths that I can go down in my life and I can tell you I do not like it. So number one, there is no off switch on a tiger. When you turn it off, it's not pretty. Number two, right now, um, my wife and I probably make around six millionish a year passively in terms of like we have virtually like on the let's say if uh zero is you're literally doing the thing and 10 is uh you forgot that you do that there's anything to be done uh and that would be completely passive versus completely active. I would say that we're probably like an eight and a half. I'll tell you this, it's not fun. when we were actively involved uh in our businesses um compared to now. I think honestly it was more fun. Um and I think a lot of people always want to you know portray that their current state is the most advanced state. Um and I can tell you over the last nine maybe 12 months man I've done almost nothing. I mean the the three videos a week I make on YouTube are is probably like the most uh engaging work I do. It's like the only thing I'm like looking forward to uh every week because of how little that I'm doing in the business. And I'm reason I'm bringing this up is this. All right, so make sure you hear the right message from this. I I'm saying this in no way to flex. I'm saying this because I made that the goal and I think that now that I am here, I regret it. I continued to solve problems in my business and I had the perspective which was spoken to me as a younger entrepreneur which is if you're doing something if you're actively involved in the business it means it can't run it without you which means there is something wrong which means you are not as good as an entrepreneur as you think you are because you are required to make this business work which means it's not a real business right I think that's horshit and I think that I can tell you right now truthfully because I've walked it it's not just like a hypothetical idea Like I truly do almost nothing in terms of what is on my calendar every day. And I can tell you I'm bored out of my mind. And so next next season, so starting 2022, I'm going to be doing some big stuff, right? But the entire goal that I optimized around for years was passive income. It was I want to build a business that can run without me. And from the dividends that I get from that business, I can do whatever I want. But here's what's crazy that they don't tell you. If you love the game, then why would you want to get yourself out of it? Huh? Isn't that weird? It's like, I love this thing. I'm so good at it that I'm I'm going to play basketball so well that eventually I'm just going to stop playing and the team's going to win without me. And so I think what I've given myself permission to do as of late is I've given myself permission to work for the love of working because I choose to. And so I think that I had this idea when I was trying to scale my businesses that I wanted freedom to do whatever I wanted, right? We want the freedom to choose. But for some reason over time that got that got morphed into everything has to be passive. And I can tell and I'm I'm I'm making this video so that hopefully you don't make the same mistake which is like it's okay to run your business and it's okay to like it cuz I I missed the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of it. I'm going be honest with you. I do. But in an effort to create space so other people could rise up and they could have their own growth and development, I moved away so that they could have that opportunity. And the thing is is now I can't really jump back into the business because otherwise I would I would displace people, right? I'm not needed. And so, it's been an interesting interesting process for me to walk through this. We have this dream. We have this goal to have this thing that kicks off cash flow every single month that's far in excess of what we need to live. But I am in a building where I get to see the outcome of what that looks like every day. And it's not pretty. And I can tell you over the last nine months, 12 months of what my life has been, it's not pretty. It's not fun. It's boring. It's empty. There's nothing to do. And I I got this quote from Takim Moore and I really like it. He said in the Bible, the first thing that God did and gave Adam was not Eve. It was a job. And I think that there's just been this this this I don't know demon demon demonification. I don't know if there's a word there. Yeah. Something bad, right? people have been batting um shaking their finger at work. Why? It's what we're supposed to do. And so I think that if we can focus on and this is what I this is where I'm kind of walking towards right now is is now that you at least for me this is me talking to myself is like now that you've you've figured out that you can truly create something that can run without you. You've learned the skills of not just quote building a passive business, but truly a business that can run without you and grow, comma, and grow. All right. There's one thing to create a business that can maintain without you and still continue to generate cash flow. It's a totally different thing to be able to put enough talent in place that a business can grow without you. That is when you actually have a business. I now know that I can do that. I can check that box off. But I feel like now I can be certain in that I can make the choice to say I know that I can do that and I choose not to because I choose because it is my choice because I sought out freedom, right? I have the option. I know that I can build that. But now that I have experienced and I've tasted that fruit, I know that of the different flavors of fruit, the one that I prefer is I prefer the challenge. I prefer the game. I prefer being in the game rather than watch the team win without me. But I just think that passive income uh is not as cool as people think it is. I think we need to make active income cool again. We're meant to work. We have the freedom to choose, not the freedom to do nothing. Cuz we think that we're we want to have freedom to do all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that we want to do. But thing is is in the g in the course of building the life that we have. There's nothing that's as that gives you the rush of business. Nothing's as high octane as this, right? And the stuff that is as high octane as that, if done enough times, eventually you're going to die. You got into this game. you had these things and these hobbies that you enjoyed. You get rid of those hobbies to go double down on the game. You go and you continue to play the game. You eventually win the game, right? And then you look back and now you have all this time because you continue to trade things to get more time back. Get more time back. Get more time back. And eventually you have all your time back, but you have nothing to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] do. And so then you're stuck in the position that I'm in right now, which is what do I enjoy? And I enjoy doing the things that got me here. And so that is what I'm going to be doing in the next uh the next chapter 2022 is I'm going to be doubling down very aggressively and you'll be seeing some moves from behind the sidelines uh behind the behind the glass of what I'll be doing. But I'll tell you that seeking pleasure is not the game. It's incredibly boring. Um and uh and yeah, this is something that no one ever shared with me and I figured I would share it with you because Mosy Nation, you guys [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] rock. Love you guys. Um, and if you're new to this world, uh, I think I said at the beginning, but if I didn't, my name's Alexi on acquisition.com. We do about $85 million a year. And if you enjoyed this video, I'm glad you did. And keep being awesome. And I'll see you guys in the next one.
