================================================================================

there are four big levers in your business that could be messed up I'll show you how to figure out which one it is and how to fix it so you can scale your business we had those four levers that I had earlier we've got traffic we've got conversion we've got price and then we've got churn so those are the big four things and so if we want to grow the business those levers have to change or the business will not grow and so for many of you it might just be you need more traffic like the business model is fine the economics are fine and you need more traffic and so basically at least my thought process that I have with this is I try and scale as much as I possibly can until something breaks and then when it breaks we fix that thing and then go back to scaling the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of it again I mean fundamentally that's what we do and um I mean I I teach this at at for for businesses but I'll I'll walk you through it what is going to go to these four levers that we talked about earlier right which is going to be your traffic your two FS there whatever conversion which is you tweaking your about page making a vsl that's better adding Carousel images tweaking the bullets that you have on your landing page uh you've got the price which you can test and then you've got churn right which has a big list of things that you can do so these are the four levers the things that you're doing have to Lad up to one of these four if it doesn't lad up to one of these four things why are you doing it all right so like if we were to translate your objective with the free group you would have to say okay I think that the US reactivating the free group will increase traffic that's fundamentally what you do it you want this traffic source to make you more money from your to towards your ticket High ticket thing and you say okay how much work will it take me to reactivate this group okay is there anything else that could get me more traffic than reactivating the group of the things that I have available so right now could me just spending more money on ads or making better ads make us more than me spending the time to reactivate the group if so forget reactivating the group make better ads or spend more money on ads does that make sense so once you figure out and when we're picking which of these three things four things that you're doing the thought process is what which of these is the biggest constraint in the business and so if conversion rate let's say for example on the on the landing page is super low then it might mean like hey before getting more traffic I'm going to I think I can double my conversion on this page because I haven't really spent any time on it at all okay well then it makes sense to spend a day or two like can I really clean this up and make it as crisp as humanely possible with the language that I use can I grab screenshots that are more meaningful that like you probably had more testimonials things like that you haven't updated like can I put that on there can I make an actual 3-minute vssl that that is more compelling than the one that I just like tossed up there okay that's probably a day of work well it's probably high leverage because I can double the growth of the business by just improving this conversion metric pricing like well if everybody just pays you more we already went through that example over here um this could obviously make you more money and then you have your big list of things that you're doing for turn and so cool which of these is the biggest uh thing that's going training the business you pick the one that you're working on and then for me I tend to think through this more better new and I tend to do it in this order most of the time so like I will just ask one of our portfolio is like why can we not just do more of what we're currently doing like whatever we're doing why can't we just do more so you'd have to make an argument to me that we should reactivate this group rather than just spending more money on ads and you have to make an argument that it's easier and it will make us more money than spending more money on ads and if you came with the argument that' be like well then forget about it if we can't do anymore for whatever reason we have some limitation like we can't post more than twice a day on Instagram like we just can't or we can it just like we've seen that when we post three times it doesn't doesn't heal the same performance so two is kind of The Sweet Spot fine all right then what can we do to make it better right okay because if we can make those two posts just higher quality overall can we like really think through the hooks can we make sure that they're tight that they appeal ideally to the audience that we're looking for if we do better then the quality of the traffic will go up the more views will go up does that make sense now if we can't do any more any better then we need to try something new and you notice that most of the times you can do more of what you're doing you can do what you're doing better which is why I so rarely do new things once you have something that works that's the hard part once it works it's like how do we scale the living crap out of it and the reason that most entrepreneurs in my opinion especially small ones get stuck is that they find something that works and they stop doing it and then they get distracted by six other new things and they get completely spread thin and it's and like what's ironic is that the small business owner is the one who has the least amount of Leverage and you have the basically your your contribution your time contribution to the the income of the business is more direct than anybody else's especially at this level and so like you like saying okay I'm going to take a third of my time that might just be like decreasing your business by a third um and so you have to have a very strong argument for why that's going to make sense and then for who once you have a team then that becomes the the next thing it's like okay we know we going to increase traffic the way that we're going to do that is like we can't do more posts on Instagram so we're going to make them better and this is the process that we're going to focus on getting better which means that uh once a week I'm going to take three hours and and I'm going to script out I'm going to look at other people's you know content that have really good hooks I'm going to write down all the hooks and then I'm going to make content that I think is going to appeal to my demographic in a better way cool now who's going to be you know if it's you then you're the who in a lot of these if the business gets bigger then it's like okay Jeremy you're running this and then we just measure to make sure Jeremy does his job that makes sense in terms of thinking through this and so we just want to make sure that what you are doing is going to map to what's going to drive growth within the business and I swear to God so many times people are just doing [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that does not map to this okay Red's over one quick question on that the the first four is there like a certain priority that you would recommend for like I'm a solo operator I'm doing like 50 a month P Toc offer is there like one of those big four that you would recommend prioritizing first start here okay because this is how you have lifeblood in the business so you have to promote you have to acquire customers once this is relatively consistent even at a low level I then this is me how I think through this now not when I was younger normally I would just be like just do as much of this as you can foret everything else now it's do enough of this so that we can keep working on how do we how do we find the things that people actually want versus what we think they want and then there's the things that we can remove like how can we delete things how can we make this simpler how can we make it more elegant how can we shorten the the models that we have I mean we're hiding classroom for new people like think about this like we remov three calls a week like we're trying to take things away not because we don't want to add it's easy for us to add the value it's but we want we want them to consume it and so consumption should be the highest priority for everybody here in terms of making like how do they get value they have to consume value right so priority and so um we start here until you have enough flow going through the system that we can see what they really want and a lot of times these simple things like the last semester I think we went through a ton of depth of all the things that you can do to reduce turn right it's like so you experiment with that and this might be months while you're doing this I mean for context school didn't hit like a like let's go hypers scale until like recently and this was years right of getting the product right like obviously like there's people coming in every day and there was enough promotion that we basically we could test and keep learning but it wasn't like we don't want the world to find out about it yet because we want to get all these pieces right once these pieces are right enough then you go back here you scale living hell out of it boom yeah it's great so right now the question for you is if you have really low turn I don't know if you do but from what you were saying it sounds like you have low turn then then yeah do more traffic yeah do more do better of what you're currently doing so you're are you running ads yeah so you spend more spend more and Mak them better top 20% of my best customers targeted towards them now that I have that insight and then just keep making that better and then just more more better and then just spend 400 Grand a month on ads yeah sure I mean it's like an inside joke in my business like he's just going to say more better it's like y that's what we're going to do this quarter just like we did last quarter just like we did the cor before we're going to do more we're going to do better and if we do both of those things we'll probably make more money and then if there's something that prevents us from doing more or better then we fix that and then we go back to more better does anyone have questions about what they need to do for this like like you need you're like okay am I should I be spending more money well if you're if your LTV is good in terms and your and your and your CAC is low then yeah I just keep spending I guess for like low ticket communities you know recently you had a video where you went like seven things like a handwritten letters on boarding exit interviews yeah for communities on school like which one of these would you go after the first kirby I feel like you have even more insight with you the price sounds like the thing that's moving at say again the price okay because you've already experienced what that's doing right you know the average is around 20 you probably want to be on the good side of that so figure out why you're not like I would talk to your customers first like why did you cancel you want to talk to the people that cancelled you want to talk to the people that stayed and you want to figure out what differences they have and then if you find the people that stayed did these things emphasize those things if you find the people that left did other things remove those and so it might not be price I'm just yeah it but you told us so um maybe it's price so like balance that and then you know with your traffic you you can drive more of that and then you can play with about page conversion you can play with that and then when you're bard of those go back to retention CH I know I can drive like easily way more traffic it's just that I have a leaky bucket so I want to fix it so I'm like wondering if I should add the onboarding or you know EV onboarding I think for sure is a good idea and how would you execute that for low tickets you do a group onboarding and everybody who signs up gets one group on on boarding that you attend you do it once a week I think people throw a lot of [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] in their community and then they just keep adding and then they think they need to keep adding to make it better but it's not true like overwhelm is the main cause of churn think about the experience so how many things in the classroom would you say is like The Sweet Spot cuz like right now I have like eight maybe the honestly the hardest part I found when improving anything is to figure out what's actually wrong with it that I've I've been working on the school games funnel recently by the way homos will be happy about this um I figured out like what the problem to try to figure out what the problem was was actually quite difficult but in the was my it was this guy I knew from New Zealand who's a complete stoner that had text me when hosi when hosi launched the games he couldn't understand what it was and I was not going to try to explain it to him but when we came back to making this improving it I was like it turned out that he was the best signal for it actually what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is the school games I wrote it down that was the problem if you didn't know what school was you have and you see an ad from homos and he's talking about the school games and some leaderboards and coming to Vegas people don't know what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] that is so I wrote down what the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] is the school games and I was like that is the problem so but that took me a lot of research to to like mind right I was talking to a lot of people I was doing this with Kirby it's quite an interesting process right and then we were like okay well how do we describe this damn thing in a way that is make sense to like a stoner dude um because it helps to use extreme cases like Steve Jobs tested products on children because like if they could understand it anyone could understand it right so like defining the problem and then coming up with different ways you could solve it I've been doing this with goose and Kirby in the office all week we probably designed we came up with many different ways to describe what it is many different landing pages many different bullets and we just kept talking to users getting feedback and kept iterating it we probably made 30 versions some of them were so wrong it was I wondered what kind of tangent you'll never see it but you know we actually at the end of about one week we landed on something and um and now everyone we show it to instantly gets it it's like we don't actually have to fully launch to find out when you learn how you can use everyone to get like feedback and talk to people and show it to people and get their reactions you can do a lot of fast iteration Cycles without the harshness of like reality then when you launch it into reality you have a way better chance right um so that's how you improve anything like that that's not the games but that's what we were doing to the games recently we Kirby was doing interviews with all of the winners that was overwhelming not many people were showing up so we cut that we just did one hosy Q&amp;A a week right attendance is up every viewing is up people are now saying that it's way more valuable and you know so it's we were unlocking the one day recordings after you got three customers we like why are we making it hard to get the most valuable thing now you just need three members they can be free right so like what do people value how do we make more people experience that what do people not value take it out what do people not understand reword it you see it's all the same but I I will I will I will emphasize what Sam saying is that there's a it's so much more work than you expect it to be and everyone wants like the one silver bullet that you're going to magically fall on it but if it were obvious you would have already done it and so it's like it's disguised and that's what I mean this is literally what makes business hard and so I'll have a business owner on a Q&amp;A call say like what should my price be and I'm like I don't know I'll walk you through the process of how I'd figure it out but I don't know your avatar I don't know your traffic scource I don't know the value prop of your community and even if I did I would say I'll start here and I'm going to do the math and I'll move it and I'll do the math I mean with the portfolio same thing I it's like we tested 50 35 25 15 we just tested it I was like I don't know we'll find out and then they were all the same and then I was like okay well which business would I prefer and then we go into that right and so just just in terms of thinking through things like the amount of effort that goes into it that most I would say that like as I've gone as I've G moved up in business the my understanding of the level of effort that's required to solve complex problems has gone up 100x it's just significantly harder to solve more complex problems and that's also why the biggest paydays are on the other side of those problems because if they were really easy to solve everyone have already solved it so it's like four hours in a cup of coffee and a bunch of data and you're like all right let's try this there's a quote I learned from the software engineers at school they say you have to make every detail perfect but the only way you can do that is to limit the amount of details that you have so inside of the school games we have eight videos all of them together are less than 45 minutes one calls we do one call per week and that's it and once a month you get a download from here the Mastermind that's it very easy to explain to someone one call one course one Mastermind a month and there's 13,000 people in there each paying 99 a month and they get the school [Music] software I have a question yeah so there's a fine balance between because if you're a leader of a big Community right if you're showing up too much you kind of almost lose your power right and if you do Q&amp;A every single day nobody want it's not special so how would you balance Q&amp;A calls making posts inside of the community and just showing up and like giving people attention like that I'm sure there's a data answer for this rather than me just guessing we can probably find it out of like what the the best you know Cadence is I'll tell you I personally I think post twice a month in school that's not planned I just I just kind of poke around and I see what people are struggling with I made that Niche post because I was really tired of people be like what's my Niche going to be about and I was like here's how you find your Niche and so it's just like I just listened to what was the like there's you probably noticed this in your community it's probably like a pro like a problem dour it's like people just kind of glob onto a single problem all of a sudden and like I felt like I was seeing more and more of that so I was like all right I'm going to try and answer this and so then you make that and then it's like hope and if it does if you put the thing in and then that problem still exists then you didn't do it right so it's like you have to do it again you have to make it simple you have to make it easier whatever it is you keep doing it until that one goes away and then like the next problem will occur and the good news is that your customers will always have problems yeah and so you just solve them I can tell you a good thing that works for me um so I spend a lot of my time reading what people are saying like I'm trying to understand what things people are struggling with so I'm not in there just posting a lot I'm in there listening the most more than anything else most it would be like 90% it would be like a lot of time is spent listening trying to figure out what is going on what should I improve what problems is the community facing right then when I'm pretty sure I've got those problems I'll even talk to some pal users and I'll validate do you think these are actually problems right and then I'll make sure I'm clear on the problems first okay now if I spend now prioritize them what's the most what is the most pressing problem okay number one now just focus on that at least I know if I just fix that I'll add some value right yeah so now I'll try to fix that and I will try to fix that by research experimentation Etc and then I'll come back to my community and say hey I saw all you guys were facing this it sucks I fixed it here you go and that's how I like that's how you add value seriously no like I have I have this little template on my wall for emails which is uh hey I made this thing for you here's what it does good afternoon enjoy like CTA like that's like that's my email template like it just makes it really simple like hey you guys were struggling with this thing I made this for you here's why it's important goodbye the hard part is finding the thing yeah like I said how do we make the school games funnel better well what's the problem with it that's the real question and it was some Stoner dude who had the answer yeah so you wouldn't have a schedule of like posting daily or second like every second day or definitely not that's like a Henry Ford production line for Community like we're not trying to pump out posts fast that's not what makes a robot it's not that's not a good Community a good Community is something that under stands your pain and experience and delivers Solutions and is fun yeah you right yeah and isn't overwhelming and doesn't make me read five articles a day right like value Post Yeah cuz I don't want to read a bloody article that's a pain in the ass like I want a solution or I want to laugh one of them yeah I'm doing 17 lives a a week in my paid at the moment so but my my feelings telling me to put it in the free community but I mean that might be stupid because I'm trying to listen to what you guys are saying you're saying no we're just doing one now and it's like so I'm a bit the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you know I think if you want to use all that like all that so last last games a ton of people I think it was last games it was like it was like the lives games it like everybody was doing like Instagram lives might have been maybe two ago um and that the thing is is like we have to separate promotion from so from a promotion perspective you're doing lots and lots of lives you're making lots of posts you're making all this stuff oh no I understand I got you and so my point is is like I would take all that energy and put it into promotion so you get way more people into your community and then the thing is is that you if you do 17 lives a week externally it's okay that people don't consume all of them because if they consume one of them then they might buy whereas if you're inside of the community and you're doing 17 they might be like oh I'm missing out on 16 out of the 17 I'm not I'm not getting the value if it's free your cost is time and so as long as you deliver a return on the time that they spend consuming your content then they got they have a positive exchange with you and so you basically it's like you can never promote too much you can put too much inside of the community and so I would take some of that Juju and put it externally to drive more through the box I think H actually did like the opposite like when he increased the daily coffeee to like nearly every day oh his churn like reduced massively so I have no idea oh he's messing me like every day and trying to figure out like all kinds of things around churn at the moment um I my answer to him he keept coming up with ideas my answer to him was talk to your customers I recently was pretty public about this is that like I widened my content for I think either 3 or six months I like started sprinkling in some other other pieces I talked about how I eat and like Lea you know how Lea and I run you know being married and things like that and the the the problem is that you do get positive reinforcement from it and so it's like he made some stuff on relationships and then people were like oh this is awesome but the thing is is like the wrong people were saying it was awesome and so what was happening is my audience was growing but it was growing with the wrong people and so I had I mean I had this moment where like sometimes you have these like I had a a friend of mine come into a friend acquaintance I would say flew in and was like um he probably does 10 million bucks a year and uh and he was was like yeah you know um yeah I don't I don't listen to too much of your stuff anymore and he's like yeah I was Hardcore for like six years um and then I I just kind of um I guess it didn't really apply to me anymore he's like I guess I'm not really like your avatar and I was like you're 100 most [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] Avatar like you are exactly who I'm going after and then I was like oh I'm a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and I just basically it's like you you get you get it's a balance like you want to listen to customers but you also want to make sure you're listening to the right customers and so um I reoriented all my my content which maybe some of you guys have seen um and it's been 100% back to business has been the the theme that we have internally my guys now um is that if it's not business we don't make it just very straightforward like it can be business adjacent so like if I talk about you know prioritizing like tasks in my day that can have some element of productivity into it but it's like all my examples are going to be business related and so but by doing that when I looked objectively across metrics for site conversion opt-in Book Sales applications to the portfolio all of those metrics went up even though the average view per video went down and so it's like I'm not in this to get famous I'm in this to make money cool question um I wonder if anybody has I this might be for everybody but like has anybody done anything to when they do have a turned customer to get them back into being a customer or send a funny gift you just send a funny gift in a DM ask credit P you have you seen him yeah ask him for his message he's apparently got some message he DMS people with a funny gift and it gets people to reactivate just say it's like something like leaving so soon is kind of like the vibe is kind of yeah but you want to get the funny gift of course yeah and it's just within school yeah okay so no email SMS or anything like that our sales team has that for uh ghosted leads they have a Kevin Hart meme that's like I think that might be it I think that's what he's using yeah and uh yeah it like it gets higher response rates than any any message this is kind of for both of you probably you say as well definitely some um but I guess like when you're building you know a startup um obviously you know you might have sometimes you might have a little bit lack of capital A little lack of resources I guess how do you get a players to work for you and with you and how do you like structure comp structures and all that so it like the vision for the business has to be big enough that smart people can fit their dreams inside of it and so if you want brains then you need people who like they need to be able to believe that their dreams come true within your vision if it's again if it's like yeah we've just got a couple groups that we're running and we're making money then it's like that doesn't like really get me motivated if I'm intelligent I'm because like the best people have there's no lack of opportunity for best people they have tons like you have to think about this is It's a totally different game like you're if you're accustomed to taking people who are like I really want a job all of those people are irrelevant you have to be people who are like in some ways you're competing for them so the more you're competing for a prospect like selling them and so if you feel like like like I'll tell you the funny one is like if you're interviewing people where you're like sell me on why I should take you if you say that to somebody who's actually really talented they'll be like I'm good they just like they just don't like I you have to respond to this offer within 12 hours it's like okay I think you hit the nail right there for me like their Vision has to be our vision needs to be big enough for their dreams to fit into it you have to be able to say like what we want to do is we want to make music money into the standard for this and then they have to believe with a decent amount of certainty that it's possible and so like how you guys present like you are absolutely selling them and so like I think Drew this about on on a past one but everybody here understands you know lead generation lead nurture sales onboarding and then you know retention Ascension right that's the how you do with customers right this is the exact same process for an employee you generate applications you nurture applications the sale is the interview you onboard the employee and then either retain them or Ascend them it's the same thing and so you basically have to understand the acquis like this is when we get into scaling everyone's like two three people are like what's scaling is it's just where the inflow of talent into the business matches the inflow of customers into the business and you have to have an exceptional conversion process for attracting Talent this is where brand counts double it counts once on the front end for customers and again on the back end for talent and it becomes either a virtuous cycle or a vicious cycle either destroys your business you have a bad brand because what do you think what like what um like great talent will look at your reviews and be like oh this is yeah never mind it would work at a good place so I guess and last question I guess what what would be the best way to like acquire Talent as it just building a person or brand like in our field of work cuz I don't think it's necessarily like I can't I don't feel like I can find the right people on LinkedIn or something like that you know for what we're trying to do it needs to be people who are kind of like already kind of entrepreneurs or people were in more of like the sales or manager manager field it really depends on what role you're looking for but I can promise you that very smart people are on LinkedIn do you know how I um I I looked I got invited to speak at something and I looked at who else was speaking there and I saw hor mosy was speaking there and I was like all right there's my opportunity that was the first time we met in person yeah honestly so cool how long ago was that one year before I spoke about doing a deal m but you have to like be strategic sometimes yeah and then so you have to kind of do this old school networking thing which I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate because that's like the only time I've ever done that the whole deal was like the one deal to never do that again um but yeah you kind of have to do that I had to start going to like these software things I had to start to meet some software Engineers I had to learn about their world I had to ask people about why does what do you hate as a software engineer what do you like what makes a good company what makes a Bad Company you have to like learn everything about it and network and do that it really sucks honestly but if you're serious about it I knew there was no way I could build school without this person so I delayed starting it by a year just to find the person yeah so I was like I'm not even going to start until I find them like that's how essential I knew they were that's why I tell everyone to not do software it's just because the scale of how difficult it is to actually do it right is so hard that like no one basically no one does it right even when you know even if you know what you're doing most people can't do it and most people who are quote in the info world are like oh my info thing is INS salable so I'm going to build software and they just think that like white labeling go high level means they own a software company um like but I mean right and or they create some widget that someone else can duplicate in 5 seconds that they did off with an offshore developer that like if it actually did work then that developer would hold you Ransom and then what like they just don't play it out two steps and the code [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] anyways and it's all it all sucks like yeah don't do it yeah and some were like you're just you don't want us to succeed that's why because you're you're doing so I was like no man I saw that Sam I put 5 years in it I was like great okay I saw the metrics I was like okay this is legit I SP all my money and it's still wasn't enough yeah I had to spend like twice that again yeah you guys for that too by the way that that's going to help a lot apprciate this for yeah I mean the personal brand thing is just good for recr like if you have one it's great it helps a lot um but at the end of the day if the if the if the business that you're trying to build solves a real problem and you really genuinely care about the problem if you find someone else who also cares about that problem they will be more likely to work with you like that's fundamentally it what do you sorry last question F what do you think about creating a an offer to train people to do what you are trying to eventually staff for like how I'm growing yeah like you know like in yeah you know training there was a point there was a point in time I had a closer program I was training closers and I was Staffing them you know what I mean and then I was I stopped doing that cuz there's so many closer training programs but right now I really need growth Partners people who can lead and manage our clients and kind of oversee everything what do you think about like I know there's a growth operator thing but they're not you know like in my mind like they don't have all the skill sets necessar what if someone you know created a program to train people I don't think you create another business to software role okay depends if it's like I know with a software engineer no one's going to be any decent in 10 years maybe a prodigy in six or seven but like there's just no shortcutting that like I mean my co-founder done 20 so the years matter and the same is true with a lot of things like there's just years so like but some other things might be different like setting okay yeah you can teach that closing yeah you can probably teach that but these more high level strategic things yeah that ain't happening like it took me [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] 10 years like so are you going to wait 10 years no yeah it's it's like fundamentally every skill is trainable the question is whether it's worth the return on effort and the resources to train someone with it if you break things down enough you can train someone to do anything it's just that if someone lacks has zero meta skills they don't know how to read they don't know how to write they don't know how to talk you could teach someone to do all that stuff it's just why bother so I'd rather take someone who's already here and then just nudge them if I can with you know proper training that just Bridges the gap between all the skills they come in with and then applying that to my business you got it cool appreciate it yeah I mean the people's the reason that most internet marketers in general can't make money I'm sorry they they make money but they don't make like big money is that they just can't they can't they don't know how to operate people and that's usually because they need like a right hand a true right hand who can who's as good as them and like Lea will never get the credit that she deserves and that's fine um but like the reason that all of our stuff is so big is because she's so good at at building like she's an unbelievable Builder and so like the culture of the team is rockid I mean the guys will tell you like Lea really runs the like Lea runs acquisition. comom like I I really like she really does she does likea runs everything like I I mean I told you I have an empty calendar I can't have an empty calendar and and also have a business that's running unless someone else is actually doing it Lila takes 15 meetings a day she operates she's she's coordinating things between different departments she's checking on portfolio company she's having you know one want the people who having some sort of emotional breakdown about some craziness whatever um she handles all that with a smile you know what I mean and so but like I I I was we were talking earlier like I capped at $3 million a year and then when Leela came in 24 months later I took home 17 million in income net and so the difference was that she liked people and I tried to avoid them and that was the problem and so she her Leila's genuine Vision in life is to build a company that people love working at that's her whole like the whole reason that she like she gets up like her internal mission is to build a company that people love being at every day and so her vision just fits within my vision and so I recruited her to do it but like if we didn't do stuff that she liked we' like she wouldn't build it so I very much like especially the more talented the people that you bring on the more you like like they don't need pushing like they know what they're doing you just need to make sure that they're doing it in the direction and you kind of do this yeah the amount of training that you have to give some was is inversely portional to the skills that they come in with so the more spe basically the the less skilled the person the more specific the instructions Sam could basically just be like hey can you just promote school a lot and I'd be like yeah he's not like hey could you make these posts and write this copy and send these emails and run ads and make the hooks like this like that exchange has literally never occurred like I don't even know if Sam sees the ads before before they they go out he takes me the he was like when does the activation stuff come out and I said last Thursday no like for real like I already did it and then he was like I've seen this and I was like yeah I've already been thinking about that we've got something coming yeah like we don't even I've already thought about the next four things and we've got things ready so by the time we has the idea I'm like yeah we got it don't worry do your thing and then I'm like cool let me tell you what what I'm doing on the media side it's like oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] great like these are all the things that I'm ramping up this the system we're putting in place like we changed our Cadence like things like that it's like oh dope I don't even want to think about YouTube so like if I had to tell him stuff oh my God like yeah but it's good to divide it like that cuz I can just focus on this stuff he can focus on that stuff Kirby can focus on his stuff we have very very good like division like that yeah the amount of Direction you need to give someone is inversely proportional to the skill they have yeah someone could just be like hey can you build this company and be like sure people will complain like if people it's always a sign of notice when people complain there's no communication have you has anyone had this as an issue um like with teams maybe a lot of you don't have teams yet but bad communication communication sometimes it's always the complaint yeah found it's interesting that one because you don't really need to communicate a whole lot when you get the right people like well mosy said like a couple of words and I was like don't worry I got it like what happen like right but sometimes if you hire the wrong person there's no amount of communication that can ever make it work and it's exhausting and it just still doesn't work I think I understood this I think I told this at one of the previous ones but how you know what a good culture is is this story of Google in the early days so Larry Page searched for something and the ads that showed up were not relevant to the words he typed in he took a screenshot he printed it off he got a red marker and he wrote These ads suck he walked over to the engineers and he pinned it up on the wall and he tapped it and one of them walked over and picked it Off the Wall stayed up all night that night and invented AdSense which is is their which has made them hundreds of billions chill so he didn't sit down with him and be like look I think you need to do this and this and this and maybe this he just said these ads suck right is that clear communication I mean to him it was no but that's what good talent is you can just be like this thing yeah do this yeah you don't even have to say do this you can say this sucks sort it out like and and then they'll they'll be on it or they might have already preempted what sucks cuz they've already been thinking about it so I always remember that when people say oh like you need more meetings or more communication like there wasn't a meeting first of all right there was there was slapping something on the wall yeah one of the most difficult things this is like I think this from an entrepreneurship perspective in terms of development is like has anyone here had another business before this yes okay did you achieve in this business what you achieved in your last business like in like from how long it took you to get to that level in your the business before versus how long it took you to get to that level with this business was it way faster and so a lot of the reasons is because you already beat the bosses up to that level so it's kind of like you're quickly retracing your steps and then you get to a level that you don't to your level of incompetence the difficulty the the thing that takes the longest in entrepreneurship is figuring out what good looks like at each level and it's one of those things that's really hard to translate like you see the billionaires on stage and they're just like I you know get great people and you're like sure but the thing is is that connecting what great people to them looks like in their mind and what you think great people are that is an ocean apart and so I mean I tell this story and Sam when I was talking about this last time but like I when we started meeting with private Equity firms uh to to to look at transacting with gym Lodge I we'd have these super long tables that were these board roomes and I'd see their team all the way on this side I saw my team all the way on this side and I would just kind of sit there and listen to like the questions that they were asking and the responses that my team had to be fair the team that we had had built $100 million do plus company pre covid obviously I sold during Co which actually hurt my valuation but not the point um so they built a $100 million company which is cool but when I saw this the town on this side I was like oh that's why these guys are going to make $3 billion over the next five years this team and it was such a stark contrast in terms of the level of talent again not disrespecting my team it was just such a difference that it was literally like after that immediately I was like my whole bar was just reset in terms of the caliber of the people that even existed in the world and everything was like how on Earth do I get those people to work for me and so like right now some of you have like one person who's like man I couldn't live without that person there's somebody who's literally 10 times better than that person that exists right now and it's just trying to figure out what you you need to do to get them on your team but the problem that takes so long is looking at what good talent in general looks like but even when it gets role specific like Sam had to do all this research to figure out like how do good software Engineers talk like what do they like what do they want and so some of you guys are at a point where you need to like start hiring a sales director or something like that like what happens is like this is the entrepreneur on know it looks like you bring someone on you talk to a bunch of people and then you're like I think this guy's good you bring him in and he sucks and that takes six months away from the growth that you would have had because your sales team and this guy sucked you put bad processes in then you got to fix the process you got to fire the people that guy hire cuz he sucked anyways and then you're like shoot I'm going to try again you bring the next guy in and then sometimes it happens again and you're like wow this sucked and then the third time and sometimes this takes a year or two years and then you're like I now know and you get lucky and you get one who actually works and you're like oh this is what a great sales director looks like and so the next time you go through your entrepreneur Journey like you go right to there and then you're like shoot I don't know what a good customer success person looks like and then you try again and so it's like however quick you can work through that so you can start recognizing the pattern of a what good looks like in general and then B what it what good looks like for a specific role that's how quickly you move through the levels that's been my experience with this and I wish I try and do everything I can to try and translate that into the stories that I tell with the content but sometime it's really tough because people like nod but like that is that is the secret sauce like that is it is being able to recognize like what a good growth partner looks like what a good even a good agency I've have good I have good agencies that we work with with now vast majority of them 95% of them are dog [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] some of you guys run them so like that's that's that's that's the pattern recognition that's the highest value thing that you end up learning as an entrepreneur is what what good looks like
