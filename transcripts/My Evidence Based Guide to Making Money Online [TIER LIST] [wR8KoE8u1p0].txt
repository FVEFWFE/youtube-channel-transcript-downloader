================================================================================

I've grown my brand to over 10 million subscribers across all platforms and in this video I'm going to break down by tier which of these platforms has the highest potential for making you money with my real up-to-date stats and where I'm investing for the next year so let's start with Tik Tok so if we're going to analyze platforms based on how much money-making potential they have inside of them then these are the stats that I care about first is who so who's on this platform if there's a platform with tons of kids on it versus people who have gazillions of dollars I'd rather be on the one with gazillions of dollars how many of those people are on the platform is it is a function of how much market share that particular platform is captured of my ideal who next we have what's my ability to grow on the platform some platforms are really easy to grow some platforms are really hard to grow the next one is the depth because I don't want people to just recognize my face although that is good but I would much rather have them have a good relationship with me where I can provide tons of value which then increases the likelihood of them converting and then finally I'm going to give you the results that I have now underneath of depth I'll also give you a little bit more intrinsic stats like average view duration average percentage viewed so you can look at your own stats and kind of have that as a benchmark so let's start with who I looked at Pew research to see which percentage of platforms have $100,000 families or higher and how many of them are on that platform want to know what it is for Tik Tok it's 27% all right so 27% of families so almost one out three out of four are not on Tik Tok who make over $100,000 a year that was surprising to me but when you hear some of the rest of the stats it will become less surprising the next question is how many do we have here and so this is a function of market share within the United States which on Tik Tok is 33% now we're like Okay so we've got a lowish amount of people who make money there's 33% market share across the us at least now let's talk about growth now on Tik Tok growth is one of the highest and best components of Tik Tok as in it's one of the easiest ones to grow but I will say that in recent history it's become harder and harder to grow and because of the way that they've changed the algorithm what we've noticed is that shorts on one platform NE don't necessarily work on Tik Tok anymore and so now it's platform specific something that works on Facebook reals might not work on Instagram reals that might not work on YouTube shorts which might not work on Tik Tok and so it's actually becoming more and more fragmented which is why this video is so important so you put your attention where it matters most with all that being said Tik Tok still ranks high among the Platforms in terms of discoverability and your ability to grow from zero meaning it favors newer creators now it still may be hard but it still favors people equally versus other platforms where they still skew towards larger creators so when it comes to depth our next marker it's about how much time are they going to actually spend per unit of content that we put out so Tik Tok ranks really low here so on the low side you get something like five seconds to 20 seconds at least these are the statistics that we have on the low to high side in terms of duration per view now mind you that's not a lot of time to provide a ton of value especially it's just someone's immediately scrolling immediately scrolling and if you absolutely murder it and you get 25 seconds from them I think the main benefit you get is that they just recognize your face I can almost tell whenever I get recognized in public when someone is a Tik Tok viewer because they're like you're that guy I don't know your name but yeah I see you right versus people on like YouTube are like dude you've changed my life you've made me so much money you're the best I know your name I bought your book it's completely different Avatar in terms of the experience so then we have conversion now Tik Tok has two things that are kind of interesting that you might not know so number one jenzy prefers Instagram DMS to Tik Tok DMS and so in terms of your ability to convert people from Tik Tok it actually tends to be significantly lower now for very low ticket things things like Tik Tok shop are coming out are having massive adoption which is encouraging but if you're selling any kind of services which 78% of businesses are this one's kind of tough and so I'm going to put this as low and to be clear Tik Tok a couple years ago was amazing for new creators because it was the first one that had short videos which is easier for someone to get into it's much harder to write make a 20 minute high production nice valuable piece of content for YouTube versus a 15-second short that you can put on Tik Tok but then the other platforms caught on and you got YouTube shorts Instagram reels the Facebook reels uh and all the other platforms that have short LinkedIn has shorts now like they're all over the place and so let's get to the results and this is where it gets really crazy and so I have almost 900,000 followers on Tik Tok at the point of this video and the amount of traffic that I get from my Tik Tok despite being about a tenth of my follower account is only 2.5% of all of the traffic that goes to my page which I've tracked on our CRM and so it basically has 1/4 the effectiveness per unit compared to the other platforms which means that some other platforms are disproportionately making up the volume and the whole reason I wanted to collect all this data for me was because there was a business owner who was a winner of the school games so school.com games and when he came out he was like yeah it's really weird I have 800,000 on Tik Tok and I have 200,000 on Instagram but 90% of my Revenue comes from Instagram and I thought about that and I was like wait a second so think about this the amount of time that he spends on Tik Tok could he spend all of that time on Instagram and get 10% more to make up for all of it and the answer is probably yes and so that totally changed my perspective in terms of thinking wait a second we want to grow everywhere but there's definitely some platforms where we get higher returns for our Avatar which is business owners and so for you and your avatar looking at the stats should give you where you should put your time so you can make the most money especially if you're on a budget and you can't do 10 platforms right you can maybe just do one or two you should do the ones that make you the most and by the way if you want to check out one of our workshops you can go to acquisition. comom we'd love to talk to you it's for business owners only so if you don't have a business go to school.com and we can H you star one with all this taken into consideration what am I doing with my Tik Tok strategy I am rating it an f and it's something that I'm not putting a ton of time and attention into because there are other platforms that are making me way more per unit of time money and effort I'm putting in and one more thing that my team just told me about Tik Tok real quick is that the average session length of someone going from tiktop to acquisition. my website is 8 seconds now you'll see some of the ones later are way higher so the next platform is the tubes which if you're watching this on YouTube then this is for you so we're going to cover the same metrics as before and we're going to start with who what percentage of families over 100k are here survey says eight 89% so take that in consideration versus Tik Tok which was much much lower than that all right people who have money are on YouTube the next thing is what percentage of the United States is on here 83% all right so you've got a huge percentage of the people who are making the most money on the platform and so growth for this platform really comes down to how discoverable is your content on the platform and to give you context for me at least 80% of my traffic comes from the suggested or browsed features meaning you know more than 3/4 of the people that come and watch my stuff maybe you right now actually weren't coming because you were a subscriber but because the algorithm said you might like this video and so for me I rate this as high now the next question is Okay so we've got the right people we can grow on this platform these are all pluses so the next thing is well how much time are these people actually spending with you so you can really provide value well for us our average view duration per video across all channels is over 8 and 1/2 minutes all right so it's 8 and 1/2 minutes now compare that to the 5 to 20 seconds that we're getting on Tik Tok I mean we're talking 20 times I need to do the math but it's a lot a lot more uh time is spent here versus others and so this allows you to develop a more realistic a deeper realer relationship with your audience because you can actually give them value that they can do stuff with if we want to do a quick Apples to Apples with Tik Tok obviously YouTube has shorts so let me tell you something interesting about this the average YouTube short that we have has a 33 second average view duration remember 5 to 20 on Tik Tok we're more than twice that over here on YouTube now how does this actually translate to what we care about which is conversion when we talk about the convertibility of YouTube is actually one of the lower ones but there's a massive caveat here which is that you can't D I can't DM you if you're a subscriber there's no real story that I can post and immediately see it the closest thing is the community tab that you can do which by the way murders so if you do have a YouTube channel highly recommend doing ctas on the community tab sporadically when it makes sense and so for here I would rate this low to medium the the community tab kind of brings it up a little bit but by and large it's very hard for people to immediately convert they basically have to click a link somewhere else and if you put it in the video it does kill your viation so it's like if you're going to say something you just got to make it short make sure that it's not too big of an ask from the audience and then you can put links in the description which by the way if you look at our description you can just look you want to put it above the fold so you want to have to be the first thing that somebody sees uh before they even click see more is where you want to drive them you can also Pro tip put the first comment that you have in the comment section just pin that comment so that gives you two different places and third inside the video where you can drive traffic this is just something that I've learned over time but still that's a lot of effort and it's not like hey respond to my Instagram story foreshadowing uh and we can take we can start a conversation immediately on the platform and to give context on this little Community post thing I was saying my community post over the last 30 days had 2 and a half million impressions and to get put that in context my short videos got about 18 million impressions so it's not it's not nothing it is it is relatively significant especially when you can load it with some sort of call to action in there but no matter what you pretty much have to take people off the platform in order to converse with them and potentially convert them now let's talk about results cuz all this stuff is conjecture let's get to the Brass tax which is here's the crazy thing drum roll 28.6% of our traffic comes from YouTube all right so a massive amount but there's another caveat that I want to put on top of this our YouTube traffic converts at three to four times every other platform so when people these clicks that go here are worth a ton and so the actual percentage of the contacts that we create people who want to become portfolio companies business owners that want to scale and go to acquisition. almost 60% of those contacts actually come from YouTube originally and remember that little 8sec average that Tik Tok gave us in terms of how long people even spend on the page want to guess what it is for YouTube It's 91 seconds it's a minute and a half so we're talking 10x the amount of time that people actually spending on page all right so you're taking somebody who has high intention that you've delivered value to they actually remember your name and you can actually start a meaningful conversation to help them in a more deep way VIA Commerce selling stuff whatever so one of the things that actually got me on YouTube originally one of the last pieces of content that I consumed before I was like you know what I'm going to start creating was I heard this guy who had a 20-some question application and he was on a podcast and he said I get about 3,000 applications a month and I looked at his YouTube channel and he had like 300,000 subscribers and I was like holy cow because at this point all I had done was paid ads and so I was like 3,000 inbound warm applications I was like my God if I had that kind of volume I'd be able to do so much with that and so when I saw the 300,000 and I saw that that translated into 3,000 applications a month I was like there's something here and I'm going to try and figure it out and so if you are getting started listen I have a massive team but I didn't start that way so I had one guy who I stayed committed to posting three videos a week and if you look at the very earliest videos on my channel it's me with a webcam at my desk just talking about business stuff as it came up throughout the day and so I would encourage you to just start and then all you have to do is every month or every week look back at the three videos you made the week before and just try and improve one thing and if you just stick that what happens is you create this checklist over time that becomes this Mondo checklist of what ultimately creates an exceptional video that performs I remember when I got so excited when we had my first thousand view video in 24 hours and I was like dude can you believe like there's going to be a time where we're going get 10,000 views in a day and now we do 100,000 views in our first day and so the the the levels just keep going and going and going as you grow in skill and if you're going to obsess about something these are the two things I would obsess on number one is the thumbnail one of my last two videos was no BS advice on how to get rich in 10 years and we split test nine different thumbnails and so thing one is the thumbnail matters a lot thing two is the first 8 Seconds of your video you want to be done talking about what the video is going to be about and start and this is something that when I see you know a beginner video I watch and it's like 2 minutes before they actually start the video you've already lost everyone and so you're going to lose most people in the first 30 seconds and so you want to crush the intro so they know exact it's exactly what you promised in the thumb and headline and then you get to the meet as fast as possible and this video right here we did eight different takes of the intro where I slow worked from 30 seconds down to 8 and then that's what became the intro that you saw before seeing this moment right now with all that being said the YouTube gets the highest praise in the internet uh ecosystem Jesus and gets the S tier ranking because this is where I'm doubling down and continuing to pour more and more resource resources because this is where I'm getting the best returns next up we have the artist forly known as Twitter currently known as the X Factor first up we've got who's on this platform so X has 29% of people over $100,000 in household income are on X so about the same as Tik Tok actually a little bit higher the next question is how many of these people right what percentage of the population in the United States is on X and so here this is where it's a little bit lower so Tik tok's got them they're at 33 versus 22 on X now let's talk about growth growth for X it's one of the most viral platforms because the share button is the easiest button on X and Twitter and this is fundamentally what allowed people to organically grow on Twitter to begin with but it is a platform that you have to be really really good at words and it takes a very long time to do that but the advantage is that you can actually tweet a sentence or a word or an image or a meme and so there's a lot of things that are native to the platform and Elon continues to put more and more stuff on there to make it more more viral and just continue to improve it overall and after being stagnant for years Twitter's actually back on a growth curve right now but here's an interesting tibit for X users it's a little bit more of a silo but the people who are on X tend to be really hardcore and so the average xuser spends 34 minutes per day on the platform which is about half of some of the other platforms but still not bad at all uh comparatively the next one's real quick depth we don't have stats because there's no real average view duration uh for Twitter but the easiest thing that I look at for this is how you know how many comments how how engaged people are I don't have particular stats on it but with that being said let's move on to conversion which is what matters now Twitter is interesting there's lots of people that have 1,000 person followings 8,000 person followings and make multiple millions of dollars a year on Twitter because they're super niched down in terms of the types of topics they talk about in fact there was a business that came here the other day who is an a cro marketing agency that specialized in e-commerce companies doing over $10 million a year so talk about like a niche of a niche of a niche of a niche and he was doing 5 million a year from his 8,000 person Twitter following and all he did was have indepth threads where he would just say here's the split test that one here's another split test that one and the entire thing of his bio was if you want a call click my calendar link and book a call and he told me that he was getting 8 to 12 calls a day with unbelievably qualified prospects and so one you have to go off platform but you have this link that's right there and immediately visible the second thing on Twitter is you can DM and so many people DM on Twitter all the time and so people who are on that platform are very accustomed to it and the amount of access that you get on Twitter SLX is kind of unbelievable like you've got superstars on there who will reply to DMS it's nuts first thing you don't want to do if you're just dming people on Twitter is just DM them with an ask the amount of people that have here is like hey can we hop on a call no no we can't thanks for the ass though um I think Compliments are a great way to start like Hey I Love This Thread don't just say hey I love your stuff point to a specific thread that you like and then explain why and if someone says thank you then you can respond afterwards if someone doesn't say thank you to a compliment then they're probably not going to engage anyways and so I would just start with some like what is valuable to somebody is just telling them they did a good job so I rate this a high on the convertibility of the audience now what does that actually translate into us for results so before I give you the stats on this I want to give you a little bit of context the reason I like X so much is that X is actually my hub for Content so what I mean is I consume X more than any other platform personally and I on the Fly create on X so 100% of the tweets that are on X are me in the moment just tweeting them out I heard something on a meeting someone said something and I think of a py way to say it and then I shoot it out right now the thing is is that X generates a little bit of results and I'll explain what it is in a moment but what it does do is it actually feeds all the other platforms because the captions on my Instagram are tweets from here and the long form stuff that we put on LinkedIn are just multiple tweets put together and reformatted and so if you ever see written word from Alex Heros on any platform they are words that I wrote I have no ghost writers I do have people who assemble the words that I have and then put them in a new order or group them together but that's how I've been able to scale my voice without ever being like Oh that's really cringe so your ability to repurpose all the stuff you put on X is super high our percentage of traffic that we get to our site is 6.12% % and if you look at how many people I have on Twitter it's about 6% of my total subscribers and so it's about 1 to one in terms of the ratio like it's pulling its weight in terms of conversion even though this is a short form platform compared to Tik Tok the average session duration on my site from someone from X is still four times higher than Tik Tok so it's over 30 something seconds is what people do from X on my site and for that reason I give X an a rating for me cuz the main thing is is I'm not going to stop going on X we don't really have a lot of Team dedicated to X it's pretty much just me and my team takes what I put there and then sprays it everywhere else and so this is for me incredibly valuable y'all thought I was going to put it on S I know uh but no this isn't a tier for me I mean if I had to pick YouTube or X I would do YouTube but X is the Wellspring of everything else that I make which leads us to the in of Link the link magic the Professional Network where all people are serious but no one really is and let's break down how much money this platform actually makes and I think it will it will surprise you and I have changed my view on LinkedIn who's on LinkedIn now this one may surprise you 53% of households over $100,000 are on LinkedIn so this is double Tik Tok like we were talking about earlier now the next question is how many people in the United States are on LinkedIn and this one was kind of surprising to me it was 30% so I actually thought it'd be way lower than that because I figured no one uses LinkedIn but it turns out a lot of people use LinkedIn just not as much as you'd think in terms of per day and so the average amount of time spent on LinkedIn per day per LinkedIn users is about 7 minutes so way lower than a lot of the other platforms so let's talk about growth so growth for me and growth for you should probably be incredibly important because if the point of advertising is to let people know about your stuff you want platforms that let way more people than already know about you know about your stuff and so I give LinkedIn a medium to high and I'll explain why so LinkedIn is super sharable and very connection driven and so the part that I would say is high about it is that there's a lot of people who share on LinkedIn it's very common to share stuff it's kind of like a sharing culture and when you create high value stuff people want the association with that value and then they share public because it makes them look like they've got you know they thought leaders now the flip side is the reason that I I I still have this medium anchor is that because it's connection driven so think about it like a hinge so if you have 10 people a lot of your posts will get shown to people who are friends with your connections right so it's like so and so it's friends with so and so who made this post right and so in the beginning it can be harder for you to get started because you might have a only a few connections and so let me give you a tip on this right now wherever you went to high school wherever you went to college if you went to college wherever you work all of these places are customary to have LinkedIn profiles and by the way I would strongly encourage you to at least put one up there that looks like you exist because from a professional setting I'll tell you some of the big benefits that I get that are not on this list that have been worth it for me but you can get your first 500 connections and the nice thing with LinkedIn is they just say 500 plus so it's not like you have to think like oh my God I need millions and millions of people like you max out your personal connections at 500 so it's very you can do that with a high school class like it's not hard to get going so let's talk about depth real quick because there's no average duration we have no real stats on that so let's get on to the drum roll of conversion now LinkedIn so think about think about like you know Tik Tock is like a a bomb or like a sprinkler right LinkedIn is like you've got a hose with a a laser pointer on it and you can shoot whoever you want with it all right and so the conversion ability on LinkedIn is extremely high all right and I'm I'm going to talk about this in a couple couple couple different vectors so number one is it's very high because there's a ton of sophisticated tools LinkedIn is built for outbound meaning you can get incredibly targeted with your search ability criteria for prospects and so if you want to find hedge fund managers who are in this state and above this age you can do that and so LinkedIn has something called sales navigator that you can use 40% of B2B marketers say that this is their primary channel for getting customers so like do not sleep on the ability now mind you LinkedIn ads shaky some people make them work uh LinkedIn content over overall will help you convert when you do DMS but this is an outbound monster all right and relative to the following count that you have on LinkedIn your ability to make money is probably the highest so you can have the tiniest following and make the most money on LinkedIn because of how targeted you can be with your Outreach and how easy it is to message someone who engages with your content and before I move on to results I want to give you a little hack here for the growth one of the biggest growth methods right now in LinkedIn is getting large accounts to comment on your stuff and so if a large account comments on your thing it gets shown to all of their following and so it's a massive leverage Point like think about a comment almost as a collab and so you want to do whatever you can to attract those bigger accounts and I'll tell you an easy hack for this write about them talk about how great this person is or how great a particular piece of content they made is like actually write something significant and you have a high likelihood that they will say like hey thanks this was awesome and the longer their response is the more engagement draws to you like there was a guy that U made a comment uh made a post the other day and I commented on it and he had a smallish following and that post got I think like 50 times his average in terms of likes and comments after that because I have a large following on LinkedIn and so he got to leverage basically the entirety of my Audience by just making a piece of content that I found relevant so drum roll for the results and this will surprise you over 9% plus of my traffic to my site comes from LinkedIn and the average session duration of these people is over 40 seconds all right so it's higher than every other platform besides YouTube all right so really strong intent from these people now let me give you the Thousand IQ move that is the reason that I like LinkedIn a lot so for me we have a portfolio of companies at acquisition. comom right now it's just under 10 companies that do uh over $250 million a year in revenue and so we constantly are recruiting highlevel talent for our portfolio companies and for our holding company to acquisition and so the biggest unspoken Roi that I get from LinkedIn and that Lila gets from LinkedIn is that our DMS are about recruiting so we can go directly head hunt some of the best people in the world and because we have followings because they can look at the stuff we put out there the response rates that we get are higher than any other platform for talent and so if you want to get really amazing people LinkedIn is going to be the big lever that you can use to grow your business by just getting the smartest people on your team so with all that being said we've got a lot of people with money we've got decent growth we've got high conversion ability High intent and just to give you context on this 9% it's about twice its weight based on the percentage of followers that I have on LinkedIn so we get way more per follower than like Tik talkk where I get 1/4th the amount of followers that actually translate into results so where does LinkedIn go survey says boom B tier and main reason here is that uh I don't think that it can generate as much at least for me but it is like I would put it like almost between the two but in terms of where I'm putting my actual resources we use a lot of my ex content on LinkedIn and it's worked exceptionally well and so we're probably like it's going to I'm basically continuing to invest the same amount that I have been investing in LinkedIn next up we've got the Graham the myth the legend Instagram itself champion of children father to the fatherless and uh money maker to people who shake their booties so that being said I'm a B2B guy I Ser as business owner so how does Instagram measure up for me again the results may surprise you like they did for me so number one what percentage of people over 100k are on here 54% all right so a really monster percentage the second highest that we've had so far across all platforms only second to YouTube next next how many people in the United States are on Zam all right which is 47% again the second highest that we've come to so far so pretty promising up top now let's talk about growth growth because of the Advent of re right now is high all right you can if you are formatting your stuff correctly get viral growth and they're putting more and more to try and favor new Creator so if you look at a guy named moseri he's the head of Instagram uh i' recommend following him no association just has a lot of stuff like from the horse's mouth of what they're doing in the algorithm what they want to favor and I'll tell you a fun fact that he shared with me personally not really it was on on his Instagram um is that a lot of people think that Instagram's favoring video and he said no people favor video and so that's what gets shared the most it's not that we did anything to the algorithm it's just people just prefer to engage in videos and the big thing that they care about is shares they want to see how many people take your video and then immediately send send it to friends and especially if you send it off platform so if you copy the link and then text it that's what gets more people to Instagram that's the Holy Grail of what they want for the bad news so the depth on Instagram is lower now it's not as low as Tik Tok but for us it's 12 to 20% uh sorry 12 to 20 seconds now I'm going to give you a little bit of context on this number so I personally tend to do a lot of tweet reels and my tweet reels are like 3 seconds or 5 Seconds long so no one can even watch longer than that and so that skews my data lower and so if we had the if we wanted to take the time to like look at every single video that's not a tweet real and then par the data out we could probably figure it out but I'll bet you that it's significantly higher than this based on some of these down funnel metrics so people see the Tweet RS they share them that's how some of my growth comes but a lot of the depth for me comes from alternating between these kind of higher top of funnel if you will uh tweet based uh videos versus the kind of in-depth uh me talking to business owner me at a Q&amp;A or whatever this is something that we learned the hard way so Instagram is unlike Tik Tok in terms of the fact that they penalize you for posting too much and so we've tried you know eight a day six a day four a day and so we found our sweet spot at two sessions per day so one in the morning one in the evening and we kind of spread them out now Tik Tok for example we post way more frequently and as you see I'm going to be divesting some of my attention there but you don't get penalized ized same as X you don't get penalized for tweeting more you don't get penalized for posting more Tik toks at the moment and so for us we really spend more time curating the one to two things that we put out per day on here because they're the only shots we've got so let's talk about your ability to convert your audience on Instagram so this one I would say honestly is probably only second to LinkedIn in terms of your convertibility LinkedIn has other things that make it worse than Instagram some of the other stats I shared but in terms of your ability to convert on Instagram it's so good so the only thing you can't do is get laser targeted the way you can with sales Navigator whoa uh but what you can do is you've got stories where you can do ctas you can do swipe UPS people can click links you can link it with uh tools like mini chat where if someone DMS you a certain word or comments a certain word it begins a conversation with them and so you can do all of your Commerce directly on Instagram they also have Instagram shop like they have really and they're continuing to invest in this to make this such a high convert platform and the story that I told the very beginning a guy who had 800,000 on Tik Tok and 200,000 on Instagram he was getting 90% of his revenue from Instagram I was like I need to make a video on this because I need to look at our data to see if we need to reallocate our own resources to make the most money and so here's a really important point with conversion a lot of people chase views and so like if you go up to strangers on the street and slap them and run away you're going to get a ton of views because it's crazy viral stuff but you're not going to get the right types of views from the right who unless you sell how to sell you know how to slap strangers in public and not get hit back right but unless that's what you sell that's probably going to be relevant content for you and so if you're an educator you're a business owner which most of us are Educators not entertainers then what you're going to want to make sure that you're making your content is about the stuff you sell and about the problems that your avatar or ideal Avatar suffers from and how you can help solve them all right and so there's a there's a nutritional dietitian who I met who had 5,800 followers on Instagram she do a million dollars a year and with a couple tweaks that I walk through with her I think she'll do three to 5 million just from 5800 followers and her content here's the crazy part the highest piece of content that I could find when I scrolled had 19 likes but she was making 10 sales a day on average for her $39 to $99 thing and then she would manually email every person who bought the thing and say hey want to buy my more expensive thing and she was doing almost $100,000 a month just from that simple system and you know what her really Niche was she talked about how to build insurance companies more profitably all of her content was like hey here's Aetna and how you can build them way more than you currently are as a registered dietitian so like a niche of a niche of an Niche and me personally I look at a lot of gym equipment it's something that I'm really interested I'm a hobbyist if you want to call it that and so a lot of metal fabricators you might be surprised are very terrible marketers and so a lot of them have like five likes 20 likes on their post but guess who sees them me cuz that's what Instagram knows I love if they put a new machine that I haven't seen I'm clicking on it and so I would encourage you don't worry about the likes worry about who the likes are coming from and one of the cool things with Instagram because of all the different ways you can convert on there is that you can always be seen as giving and you can convert in private and so you don't even need to make asks publicly if you just say hey DM me this or hey I want to send you this thing then you can start the conversation and you can do the Commerce on the conversation rather than in public so give in public sell in private and this enables you to do both and this may be the stat that blows your mind the most the amount of traffic that goes to my site from Instagram is 48% 48% of my acquisition. comom traffic comes from Instagram now I'll give you a little caveat here because this will be important is that by absolute amounts Instagram sends more traffic to acquisition. comom than YouTube does you're like huh well that's interesting now in terms of session length remember this was 91 this one is 28 seconds in session length so it is shorter now mind you a lot of the content here is shorter so it kind of makes sense that people would follow their same kind of consumption pattern when they click over and so here's the the down fact about Instagram from this is that when they go to my site people on Instagram convert significantly less than the people on YouTube but they convert about the same as the other platforms tldr tons of traffic coming from Instagram conversion about the same and for that reason I rank the Graham in let's see if I don't tear this damn page off here we go I rank this as an S tier is it as an S tier is that what the Gen Z kids say these days it is an S tier it's the top guy it's very good I put both of these as my my two top dogs that we're investing the same or more resources going into the next year next up we have the book of faces the man the myth himself smashbook original this one is actually one that I've changed my mind on and so before I dive into these stats on Facebook I had to restart my account because and I'll tell you what I made as a mistake so years and years ago I was a new entrepreneur and someone told me uh just go run ads in Thailand because you get clicks for like a penny and you can get followers for like 10 cents a piece and so I ran ads to get my Facebook following to 70,000 so I looked legit now here's the problem with that is that Facebook then serves content that I have this is back in the day to people who were the people who liked my page unsurprisingly and it turns out people who don't speak English and are just randomly selected from Thailand are not that interested in business content and so it basically prevented me from growing my account when I actually wanted to go legit and make valuable content this is years and years later but I still have my original profile and so we had to restart my Facebook profile just in this last year and so for those of you were like man he's he's got all these F I started at zero this year all right so and like we were like hey we got a th000 views on a video and we started all over again so like don't be afraid of that it's just part of the game everyone starts at zero so let's rock the stats real quick so of people over 100k how many of them on here 68% all right so second only to zit tube how many of people in America now this is a wild one it's also 68% of America is on Facebook now known as meta I thought both are meta I'm confused you get the idea now let's talk about growth all right because this is where it matters all right got it we got a bunch of the people that we want on there a lot of the United States is on there because it's an older platform how about growth now because now there was a moment for a few years where Facebook was very tough to grow on so it was like organic on Facebook crushed and then all of a sudden it stopped crushing and they were like you have to use our ads platform if you want get any views and basically Facebook organic like died and then they resurrected it again when reals came out and they started making reals for Facebook and so now growth on Facebook I would say is high again all right if you make stuff that's platform specific again I've noticed we have noticed that stuff that performs really well on Instagram doesn't necessarily perform well on Facebook and stuff shorts on Tik Tok don't necessarily perform well here so each platform is getting more and more you know separated in terms of what performs well so with this one we weren't able to pull our our average view per but I would say that it's high because the average session length for us is 53 seconds on our site from people who come from Facebook which means that of all the ones so I'm going to spoil this one for you uh of all the platforms it is the second highest session length on our site which has a higher translation over to contacts and downstream things like money all right now let's talk conversion so the convertibility on Facebook I would say is high not as high as Instagram but High because a lot of the same features have been carried over one is you've got Facebook Stories and people can respond to your stories you can DM on Facebook it links with tools like many chat where you can do automation on Facebook and so you have a lot of different ways that you can convert people and it's a platform where many many many many people have profiles and get notifications when they get messages so we will rate this as I'm going to say a high medium to high uh like super high medium extra medium ish medium if you will and so let's talk about results because this is what matters most to everybody here right and so this one is also fascinating so 3.8% of our traffic comes from Facebook now I only have like 150,000 followers on Facebook so for me that's the smallest of all the accounts I'm going to talk about today but this is more than Tik Tok which has almost 900,000 so my 150,000 followers on Facebook generate more than almost double the amount that my Tik Tok does with one6 the amount of people who are actually following so you look at the relative difference it's one and a half times more conversion on 1 16th so it's 9x the potency so you catching on with this here you're like wait a second you spent all this time here and in just a few months here you were able to get way more people to your site to ultimately convert later yeah and so if you're like should I start a Tik Tok or should I make more content on Facebook well I'll let you use your second brain cell and figure that one out for yourself and so one of the cool Parts about Facebook is it's kind of like a a hybrid between LinkedIn and Instagram because you can do long form text posts and like very long thread based stuff you can do pictures and you can do video on there and so it's a platform that's been really adaptable in terms of the amount of different types of content that you can create and I see that as a big plus because Facebook's almost like the whatever you want to make they'll support you in making it with the exception of Maybe audio and with that being said I have now moved Facebook in my life so before this it was below FTI we weren't even making content on Facebook at all but when we started looking at these stats I was like oh this is oh this is oh is oh H oh yeah this is actually an a tier for me and that may be surprising for you but this is where I'm putting more of my resources in the next year because of all the things I just said and to be clear before I made this video I it was lower but when we looked at all the data this is how I'm prioritizing my resources and so if you're like man which one should I should create on this should inform you also if you want the The Meta lesson here look at your data so I just do what the data tells me to do which is oh we get we have high growth here we have high conversion we have lots of people who have the money uh who are on this platform it's one of the oldest platforms they now have more discoverability and so yeah I'm putting more time into it and before before I get into our double feature for this next one uh I'm going to do some honorable mentions at the end that I am putting some resource SWS that I didn't want to put on this list that I think will be very valuable for you to at least understand but more realistically make money from so our double feature of the day we've got zip podcast which is a Spotify thing but uh it's still a podcast cuz did you know that spotify's podcast I know crazy and email and you're like wait a second are these social platforms yes and no and that's why I'm going to talk about at the same time cuz I actually think that these two platforms are more similar than they are different and so the big reason is all of this stuff is kind of your growth mechanisms and I'm already doing a little foreshadowing on our growth one here but like your email list for example is not going to just like Sprout Sprout babies and have more emails that get made right if you write a banger email you're probably not going to really grow the list but if you have a banger piece of content on these platforms you might absolutely grow your following which then goes to your site which then into your list and so the same happens with podcasts right podcast and email are both what I would consider long-term nurture you're basically putting your audience into a bucket so that you can consistently add value to them now here's the interesting thing with both these this is considered owned media meaning you can directly email anybody who gives you their email address obviously people have crms and things like that so you can blast email but you're still guaranteed to reach the email that they gave you uh Spotify and uh Apple podcast and whatnot people only listen to this is this is so important people usually only listen to three to five podcasts and so think about your Instagram for example if you look at the number of people you follow you might follow 500 you might follow a th000 you might follow 3,000 people on your Instagram and so all 3,000 of those accounts are competing for your scroll every time you log in but if you get on someone's listener followership earballs you are only competing against three for other people and so as long as you continue to consistently deliver you will basically be able to keep that person over the Long Haul now let's talk about some stats and then we'll get into the money on the people who got money we've got 54% now the stat that we found here was 75 we couldn't find uh the stat for 100k that's all right 54% of people over 75k listen to podcasts and 96% now this might be unsurprising of people whoever over1 who make over $100,000 a year are on email now let's look at America so 92 % of Americans use email I'm like what are the other 8% I want to be in the 8% uh there but uh 64% of Americans uh are using podcast or audio in some format which is actually way higher than I thought this was going to be I thought it was still like more of a you know kids Tech whatever but no a lot of people listen to podcast I thought more people would be on radio let's talk about the sad news for both of these your ability to grow a podcast is really low it's very very hard to grow a podcast same as growing an email list now to be clear these things paired with these things very valuable but these things on their own the vast majority of like big podcasters what do you think they also have big ass YouTubes so they take their podcast they put them on YouTube and then they grow now in the very very very early days when like six people were having podcasts there was growth on the platforms but now there are so many uh podcasts that are out there it's very hard Now podcast relative to the amount of people who are on Instagram I think it's like 6 million podcasts and there's I don't know two billion people on Instagram who are quote creators whatever and so you're still competing against a much smaller uh slice of creators but the card that someone's looking at they only got three to five and so there is fierce competition here now emails lots of people are spamming people's inboxes and so you have to be something that people want to click on and read so that brings us to the depth now both of these are going to be off the charts compared to everything else so the depth on podcast dude check this out 20 minutes is the average for us in terms of listen duration for people on podcast I mean it blows everything out of the water I mean the the closest is YouTube at 8 and a half now emails we don't have a depth because I can't say like how long it some to read but for us we have about 40% plus open rates on our emails and so I see that as like okay they're engaged they are at least clicking and reading the stuff that we sent out which is very sporadic because I need to work on that uh that being said let's talk about conversion so we've got these two we got lots of people with money low ability to grow really deep which you know what that's going to mean is that these guys are plus plus they're high in terms of your conversion I mean email is the conversion platform of conversion platforms so I'll give you a step if you're not making at least 30% of your revenue from email you're missing out and if you're not emailing well and this is this is me talking to myself too here you're just losing so much money because the thing is is that the return on email is the highest across all platforms all right so the average person gets 36 to1 return so if you have to spend money on someone writing emails for you these are basically free delivery like the only real cost is the cost of delivering the message and whatever CRM or sender you have to pay for however many emails a month you need to send and the person who's actually writing the email if it's not you that's it that's the only real cost and you can absolutely write a amazing copy make crazy offers there's the least amount of Co compliance that you have to deal with like if you get your Facebook ad account shut down or you get your Instagram you're not really going to get your email taken down now you could get a bad reputation with like Gmail and then they stop putting you in the main inbox that put you in promotions but big picture as long as you're doing things the right way you can have exceptional results with email in terms of converting an audience and with podcasts I'll say this I put a plus here I'll make it a I'll make it a plus minus the amount of people that trust the person that they listen to podcast is through the roof all right so when you make a recommendation the percentage likely that your audience that listens converts is very high but the actual difficulty of converting on podcasts is also High because most times people have to take out their phone type in the address or like it disrupts The Experience most people are listening they don't have their they're on their they're on their they're listening to their car radio CU they're listening to their car or they you know the phone's next to them or it's you know they're at the gym and so they have to stop midet and be like okay now I'm going to type in this address and they'll go convert or they have to remember to do it later which they never will and so that's to me a very big downside of this but it still in my opinion allows you to just get this huge amount of depth with an audience so that when you do make ctas everywhere else it increases the likely they convert but let's talk about results now for podcast I actually can't give results because when people type it in separately I can't know if they came from anywhere but I know that podcasts help us now emails is absolutely tracked and I can tell you that those numbers that we said uh are good now here's where it gets wild 133 seconds is the average session time of someon on email on my site now here's why this is exceptionally powerful we already have their email so this isn't me tring to convert them uh I already have their contact info so this is when I'm making a call to action saying hey we just opened up a new date or two dates for a scaling workshop at our headquarters acquisition. comom in Vegas if you're business doing over a million bucks a year go there so by the way you can go there acquisition. comom and just hit the scale button if you're a business owner if you're not a business owner don't do that um but if you're spending a minute you know 2 Minutes Plus on there it means that you're actually like engaging with what's on the site deciding to book a call with our team all right and so this is monstrous and for us we're working on sending more emails because honestly I'm so particular about written word which is why I've been so hesitant to send emails to begin with you'd be surprised right big author likes uh is very particular about his words yeah that's me and so like I said for Facebook there are some things that this video is changing about my behavior and so definition of learning same condition new behavior and so if you watch this video and then it changes what you do as a result of it than you have learned and so for me taking this data I have learned things and so let me tell you where I'm prioritizing jeez all right so where are these guys going where are these guys going for me this guy is staying in the b class all right I do like the depth of it I hate the fact that it can't it's really hard to grow but I do think it longterm is good for brand and things like that email right here I'm putting on the same level this is a tier the only reason it's not s TI because you can't grow but in terms of convertibility this is the monster of convertibility it's LinkedIn sales navigator on steroids it's the people that already trust you the most and you can consistently continue to deliver messages to them whenever you like as long as you continue to provide value so I have four honorable mentions that I'm not going to do the full Deep dive on but I think are important and the last one is the one that you will not expect and has made a tremendous amount of money for me that if you're good you can crush on so the first three are Pinterest Snapchat and twitch now right now twitch has been favoring super super long streams like all day long streams like walking along with me living Day in the Life whatever and people are going nuts for it I it's been tough for me because I do a lot of meetings with uh portfolio companies and I we share stuff that I can't really talk about and so like it gets tough It's actually why I haven't made many Vlogs because it was so hard uh the in and the out and if I'm working for hours so I I haven't done it but if you have a life or a workstyle that allows you to do it I think twitch is a huge opportunity now Snapchat has done an exceptional job at Commerce and so the average revenue per viewer on Snapchat I think is one of the highest if not the highest across all platforms and so it's really big in uh Millennials but it's coming at coming back fast with like gen Z which is kind of interesting and so um that's one that I've kind of have my eye on I still haven't put it on my list of where I'm going to invest resources into I want to keep doing what we're doing better but it's one to keep an eye on now now Pinterest if you are in a business that has anything that's very visual I you should absolutely be on Pinterest so I had an art dealer who came here and she had 90% of her business came from Pinterest and Pinterest has the highest average revenue per user all right so I think it's 120,000 plus is the average it's wild how many uh how much people who are on Pinterest make and so like it tends to be female skewed and so like think about the arts and craft stuff think about wines think about decoration home decor those types of businesses if you're in one of those Smash and highly recommend putting resources there because again you're not going to be competing against a lot of people because far fewer creators are on there all right so what is my big secret number four drum roll please well I've actually been seating you with it this whole time and know the books are not a traffic Source it's actually Amazon so if we think through the same vectors we had earlier Amazon what percentage of people who are over 100,000 on here all of them 300 million Americans are on Prime are on paid subscriptions absolutely absurd the most successful product adoption in history was Amazon Prime next is how many it's the whole United States everybody's on Amazon so for you to grow on Amazon you absolutely can and so what a lot of people don't know is that Amazon was actually one of my earliest platforms and so when I had only 10,000 followers on Instagram and I had maybe 10,000 followers on YouTube I don't even think I was making YouTubes yet I published this book and so a lot of people think that this book has the 26,000 five stars that it has on Amazon because of the following that we have and that's not true this book sold more copies than I had people on my email list all right so talk about contacts versus customers now Amazon has all of this traffic of all these people who have money now are are these people able to convert [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you they have a credit card on file and they can buy in one click so Amazon is built for Commerce it's also why twitch is one of the things that there's some there's big opportunities there now I'm going to do a little caveat here if you are an influencer or you would like to start creating content I think that Amazon is a sleeper and so let me walk you through some math my book page converts at 30% all right so like if you had a 30% optin you'd be like stoked no no no 30% of people who View my book page buy a book and to give you a relative comparison here Shopify the average is around 2% so it has a 15 time at least for me 15 times higher conversion for me versus Shopify because there's so much trust innate to the platform so if you are an Instagram influencer or Creator if you promote someone else's stuff the commissions on Amazon I'm pretty sure fixed about 10% but if you can convert 10 times more people when you send them to Amazon than you do when you send them to something that you get 20 or 30% on that only converts at 2% you're still going to make more money and as an added bonus when you promote stuff on Amazon in my opinion it doesn't feel nearly as asky if you're like hey I was reading this really cool book I think you like it I've got a link here people are like oh he's he's always selling this stuff it's like no you're just providing value from products that you found and so I think that the Amazon affiliate model is one of the most under tapped for influencers who are like I don't know what to sell it's like dude sell the stuff you like so like instead of trying to think of products and things like that I think the V1 is just like hey these flannels are awesome I found them on Amazon and here is the link right and so these aren't on Amazon unfortunately but point being I think this is one of the most under tapped opportunities because here's what's cool about this traffic Source on top of all the things I just said if you put CTA inside of your content inside of your books the stuff that you sell people can go there and then find you and these are people that I would never have otherwise found all right so they found a book that had a zillion five stars they bought and read the book and then that is how they discovered me and so my growth here that I want to say is it's incredible and also very difficult because the only way that you can grow on Amazon is having a good product but if you do have a good product you can put in the QR codes you can put ctas if it's education based like media like books uh if you have physical products on Amazon you can put the the little QR codes in there but this is another huge stream of people finding out about your stuff who otherwise wouldn't have now results these books sell almost a thousand books a day on Amazon which is absurd a lot of people are really excited to get a th000 email contacts a day we get 1,000 customers a day from the books and to be clear this is not I make my money but these actually have become a much bigger Revenue stream than I expected given it's just you know it's $30 book and also by the way guys you can you can get it for free on my podcast both of these are in audio format for free on my podcast you can search my name this one's a sleeper and if you are good it's worth putting some of your best stuff up there even if you put it free somewhere else because I see it as a traffic source and the more money you make Amazon the more they push it if you enjoy this video and you're trying to grow your personal brand I I have a deep dive with full slides and presentation on how branding really works today to make money check it out
