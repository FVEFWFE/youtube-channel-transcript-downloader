What's going on, guys? I'm going to show you a quick video of how right now I can bill out my house for $10,000 a day and how you can do the exact same thing. So, by the end of this video, you'll know step by step how you can get taxfree income by understanding the relationship between your home and your business. So, check this out. So, right now, I've got my team at my house. So, this is my physical house. You can say, "Hey, what's up, dudes? What else? What's up?" Recording stuff. And um you can use something called the Augusta rule um which I'll break down in a couple seconds um on the on the screen so you can understand how it works. But the cool thing is is you can use your home and generate taxfree income for you and a tax deduction for your business. So you're basically double dipping twice and it's with assets you already have. So by the end of this video, you're going to have that stuff and you're going to be able to use it in your own business. So if you're a business owner, listen up. Watch this video to the end. You're going to love it. And in the meantime, click subscribe before I switch over in the other video. All right, welcome back. My name is Alex Ramoszi. I'm the owner of Prestige Labs, Gym Launch, Allen, and five other portfolio companies. We do about $85 million a year. And so, the reason I made this channel is to help people who uh are broke and don't want to be anymore or people who have lots of money and want more of it. And so, that is the entire point of this. And so, let's rock and roll. So, one of the important pieces of, you know, making and increasing your net worth is making sure that you keep as much as you possibly can while you're generating income. And I'm not saying you should be one of those people who's obsessed about it because a lot of times you should put more of your attention on your business creating value, etc. But there's obviously like ways that you can decrease your tax drag, right? Your your tax inefficiencies, I like to call them. A lot of times, and this is just my overarching strategy that I would say with taxes is that unless you're moving to Puerto Rico, it's not going to be a silver bullet. There's lots of golden BB's, lots of little ways that you can save here and there. And so right now I want to give you one of the easiest tax strategies that you can use if you're a small business owner pretty much of any kind. Like I said earlier in the video, it's called the Augusta rule. Okay? And so I'm going to try and explain this in 60 seconds. It'll probably be a little bit longer, but it will be worth every second of it. All right? So if you have your house, you can rent your house to your business for employee meetings. You can rent your house to your business for member events. So, if you have clients or customers who are flying into town or you want to hold an event or a small mastermind or a workshop or anything like that at your home, you can lease it to your business. On top of that, if you do recording like I have, I've built out I put some capital expense into my home, which a increase the value of my house. So, I get increase in value. Two, I can use that value to lease to my business at a higher rate than I normally would because a professional studio ran out per day. It would be $5 to $10,000 a day. And it cost me all in to make the studio. uh 30,000 for this room and 50,000 for the other room, which you'll probably see in other videos. And so all it cost me about 80,000. But here's the cool part. The August rule states that we can lease our home to our business for up to 14 days. All right? And so whatever my day rate is, that would be fair market. I can multiply that by 14 and I can write myself a check for that provided I've used my home for that period of time. Now, the reason and the when I heard about this, I think it was two or three years ago, I went to a mastermind and a guy was like, "Hey, I'm gonna save everybody the entire cost of this mastermind in the next five seconds." And I was like, "Okay, I'm taking notes." And I took the notes and I was like, "That was awesome." And so in an effort to disseminate information to the masses, for perspective, if you're even making $100,000 a year and you can lease your home to yourself at a fair market rate of, let's say, $500 a day or maybe $1,000 a day, that's $14,000 that you can write yourself as a taxfree check and take a deduction off of your income from the business. All right, easy strategy. And if you have a CPA, which hopefully you do, just tell them it's the Augusta rule and what you plan to do with it and they should be able to walk you through it from there. And so, hope you found video value in this video. Hopefully, I can make you $10,000, $20,000, $100,000 taxfree just from watching. Um, and I've got other videos, other strategies about increasing how much you make, growing your business, increasing your net worth, and ultimately getting the freedom you want. So, uh, check out those videos, click subscribe if you liked it, and if you didn't like it, you can tell me that I suck, and that's cool. I'll be okay either way. All right, lots of love. Keeping awesome. We'll see you next video. Bye.
