================================================================================

I fing guarantee you that you will be making more than people who have fouryear degrees you'll probably start making money by the end of the first year I was at Brooks house and she had 7 20 to 23 year olds at her house no cap one morning one of the guys was up early and he was like Hey right now I've got ,000 extra dollars like where do you think I should invest it you know I've got my 401k and I've got you know whatever stuff and it was cute it was so interesting to me because like he was looking for an investment vehicle that was going to yield him a return I want to be very clear about this if you invest in the S&amp;P 500 you know real estate things like that and you start really early and you do it for a long period of time you abely will make money it is a very safe way to live life but the moment you start investing in kind of the asset side of stuff which is like the S&amp;P stocks in general and you're not day trading or doing any of that stuff cuz that's that's stupid the moment you do that is actually the moment in my belief that you're actually ceasing to want to make more income hear me out if you're 18 years old and you Gra graduate high school tomorrow you are now eligible on the marketplace cuz you have no skills besides your high school diploma you did no job [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] off the whole time don't watch YouTube to learn stuff which is not you but just imagine in 2 days you could go and become certified as a flomist and go from making 750 or whatever the minimum wage is to what FLOTUS make at $25 an hour you would triple your earning capacity after 2 days and spending $500 if you can triple your income for the rest of your life the $500 certification in 2 days you you think it's worth the investment probably and so the problem is that people think about the biggest investment as the stuff that they take their money and they put it into and I'm going to be over I'm going to be trit right now your ability to earn money to provide value to the marketplace and solve problems for other people is how you will be able to make money there's the value of the problem that you solve and what you charge for it the bigger that number is the more you can charge that gap between their old problem and that solution that value is the percentage that you can take and put in your pocket as something that you have not created in this and it could be a service it could be products it could be whatever your earning capacity is going to be the thing that generates you wealth do you want to be smart with your money and save it absolutely cuz that gives you way more that you can play with but when you're 20 even when you're 30 and in my belief whatever age you are I believe that you should take all of the excess money live as cheap as you can take 100% of that excess money and invest it in education that increases your earning capacity because what happens is when you take that money like that full bottomy course right and you take $25 an hour time 2,000 hour a year you're now at a $50,000 a year income cool if I can live on 20 cuz I'm 20 years old and I can live with buddies and we can eat ramen soup and whatever and I got 30 left over after taxes 25 whatever 25 Grand can buy you a lot of Education I would rather you or I would rather me or somebody who's 20 or somebody who's 30 take $2,000 a month cuz that's what 25 Grand is and invest it in courses coaching mentorships workshops and seminars every month I'm putting that 2K now you could put 2K into one opportunity cuz you're like dude I think real estate's cool cool we're not doing real estate as my passive income we're doing real estate is I'm going to get into the real estate game and I'm going to make it my active income and by the way everybody who builds their wealth in real estate are actively spending their time in real estate don't believe what they're saying they're like dude I did this deal and I made x amount of money it's like what was the process of finding deals how many deals did you look at how many conversations did you have how many buildings did you walk how many different General Contractors oh wait there isn't there's other stuff that has to happen right back to the point let's say that you take that $2,000 a month and you do that for four years and I'm not saying do the four-year degree I think that is a play if you want to I don't necessarily agree with it anymore in the marketplace that currently exists four years later I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] guarantee you that you will be making more than people who have fouryear degrees you'll probably start making money by the end of the first year the amount of like copyrighting courses and books and programs mentorships and even one-on-one coaching like I think one-on-one coaching is a phenomenal way to learn a new skill if you're like hey I need to know how to buy media I need to know how to run an ad go pay someone who runs ads teaches people how to run ads when you make that payment you're seeing it as one class in your entrepreneurial degree rather than this one $112,000 investment has to make me Rich you can make that shift as like this is my course like when you get your degree in college you're not like oh I'm going to take one class in Spanish graduate and get whatever job I want no one thinks that way but for some reason to think about that when it comes to entrepreneurial stuff you're not paying someone to think that they're going to be your savior they're not going to save you from your life do everything for you no one person person is going to teach you everything I'll do my best on this channel to teach you stuff I know but you have something to learn from everyone you know like that wasn't the value that I thought I was just like you can still learn from that you want to go to the person who's providing the most value for free it's the easiest way for you to decrease your risk of purchase if you follow someone's Instagram you follow their YouTube you see the stuff they put out and you're like dude this is really good like this is a lot of new information that I didn't know and it's like very tactical and I understand like a you already know that you like the person B you already know that you're getting value from the person from the content they have and so the likelihood that the thing that they have that's paid is going to be worse than that is low you know hopefully follow lots of people in a particular space see the one that you jve with the most you like their teaching style you don't need to follow this stuff for forever to like belabor the decision give yourself seven days because you know what's really even cooler than buying one person's buy them all and then you'll know what everyone knows and then guess what happens you become just as good or better now you're making $80,000 a year well now we've got $4,000 a month that we can spend on coaching and mentorships and learnings and courses and whatnot I always saying to myself like I'm going to be the number one student here I'll just do whatever they say I'll see what happens and I'll do whatever they say I'll see what happens you want to replicate before you iterate before you say I'm going to put my Alex sauce on before you do that just make sure that you can duplicate what they're doing because then you earn the right to make the iterations even if it's not perfectly your style copy it first before you make the iterations if you see it as a bridge that has many bricks on it you have to lay all the bricks and here's the bad part let's say you've got 30 bricks on this bridge to make your first dollar the first dollar has to walk across the bridge when you're 28 bricks in you might not have made the first dollar yet but but you're 90% of the way there and the speed with which people are able to Traverse or cross that bridge is how well they identify which brick is missing and where they put their attention that's where a lot of people get disheartened is that they will start building new Bridges and get two three bricks and then they'll start building a new bridge two three bricks and they have lots of half-built bridges and they never make it all the way across let's say you're a videographer or you like video stuff skills stack exponentially you got a video skill now you got an editing skill now you understand social media messaging copyrighting and branding ooh management and operations and Leadership see how that person starts to expand you can imagine how their pay is going to dramatically increase because now you're a CMO broadening your Horizon and going deep in these other silos then all of a sudden you're an entrepreneur one is you have to make that decision that you're not going to spend all your money on stupid stuff the second is that you are going to spend your money not on the S&amp;P but on the snme what is that you're going to spend it on you because that thing is going to compound a hell of a lot faster than 10% a year you can double triple 10x your earning capacity the people who are the richest people in the world they make a thousand times more Jeff Bezos made $40 million an hour last year it's a lot
