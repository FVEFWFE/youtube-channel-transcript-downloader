So, it's July 16th, 2025. We are 30-ish days out almost to the day uh to the August 16th uh live launch. I wrote the book because I hadn't heard anyone talk or write anything about it at all. And I saw it as one of the most important things that you can put in a business. I am kneede um in just a bunch of different facets of the launch. So, it's funny because it's a, you know, it's a few hours for everyone who shows up, but it's like multiple years of preparation that we're doing. &gt;&gt; We're on the way to the airport, go meet Alex and Ila for a flight cuz content in the plane typically does better. &gt;&gt; So, I just grabbed basically every hook that's been working for the existing winners, plus a bunch of the organic ones that did well. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I feel like it just got harder cuz they turn it off and they turn it back on. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; I thought it was I walked in then. &gt;&gt; Ain't easy being easy. &gt;&gt; So, you're good just witnessing ads. &gt;&gt; I was told I'm a big clipboard guy. &gt;&gt; I love &gt;&gt; wildly underrated. Everybody's like, "Let's go to AI." I'm like, "Let's print [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out and put it on a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] clipboard. You can write on it. You can hold it. You can pass it to someone. You can keep a couple sheets in there. &gt;&gt; Never forget that. &gt;&gt; You guys might want to wait to do ads until we take off. It's going to be &gt;&gt; loud as [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; Yeah, Leila's been a sport, but being not bothered by me just doing ads and doing this BDS while she sits silently. &gt;&gt; Great. &gt;&gt; What do you think about the launch? &gt;&gt; You think it's a good idea? &gt;&gt; I think what's more interesting is hearing what it's like to prepare for a launch that you know that many people are watching. I think that's more fascinating than hearing about the book itself. &gt;&gt; Should you change that? &gt;&gt; I don't even think people would believe it cuz like at the end of the day, I don't think entrepreneurs like we don't get a lot of, you know, honestly, we just get [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on most of the time. Like we get told we're bad people and so I wanted to make an event by us for us to help solve as many of those problems I possibly can in one day. &gt;&gt; Are you sleeping? &gt;&gt; No. No. No. I can tell you. Actually, I can tell you exactly how many hours I'm sleeping. I'll tell you my last &gt;&gt; foot in death's door. I know what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Sean says, "Old man reaper is knocking." &gt;&gt; Old man mosy. 5 hours and 45 minutes last night. 5 hours and 20 the night before. 5 hours and 17 the night before that. 7:45. That was Saturday. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that was on my birthday. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that was your birthday. &gt;&gt; Well, and I love you had this tweet that's like everyone's got battered like no one's playing 100%. Is it kind of like &gt;&gt; Yeah, no one's playing. People are like, "Oh, like like I didn't do I only slept five hours last." Like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] &gt;&gt; at the volume we're doing the ads, it sounds like it'll be &gt;&gt; No red flags really. &gt;&gt; We're just on standby to see what data just says they're going to send us some data tomorrow. So there's a little more statistical significance. So then we'll turn around ad creative for both Wednesday's shoot and also the private jet ads on Friday. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I think one of the things that's really big, like I'll I'll I'll give you guys a little hint that I think is going to be our our dark horse of the the many small wins we've had up to this point. &gt;&gt; All right, great. Fireworks. I'll see you guys. &gt;&gt; I wrote the book because I hadn't heard business. And so I wrote down everything I knew about it and decided to release it. A lot of business owners think that they need to change something about their business or get into a different business because they're not making as much as they think they should or want to. And a huge part of that is your actual money model. It's your monetization structure. How you collect money, how you charge for what you do. So I started writing money models in 2021. I had a mentor who told me that I should document like the artifact or the crystallized knowledge of that. I took that advice and I ended up writing just this massive tone that was 400 something pages and uh that's what became um all three of the $und00 million uh books and so many models is offering the right thing at the right time in the right way to the right customer. And that takes a little bit of practice but that's exactly why I wrote the book. right now there's just a lot of different pieces going on. It's like we've got inventory stuff going to warehouses. We've got um other surprise little bonuses that are also traveling around the world. And I enjoy this. Like this is the this is why most people don't do it and this is why most people don't win. But like I outline those details so that it's uh kind of clear like oh there's there's more than one thing that happens. It's not like Alex is just going to go on YouTube live and be like hey I have a new book. &gt;&gt; We're on our way to North Vegas to go to the warehouse. um Money Models book warehouse to check out inventory. Alex on the way there right now. So yeah, we'll see how it goes. &gt;&gt; What's up? Ready. &gt;&gt; Hi there. How's it going? Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thanks for having us. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; How are y'all doing today? &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; So, what did you guys I guess for today? We want to make sure we hit what I know see some of the inventory on the &gt;&gt; couple pictures. &gt;&gt; I mean, we're hoping to do over a million copies. So, it's a lot of boxes. &gt;&gt; We're striving very, very aggressively to get all of the shipments out within 72 hours, which is just a herculean feat because I think we're going to pass all of the launch sales that we did last time before we even release the book this time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All right. How many How many pallets do you guys have? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to ask you to take all the pallets down. I'm just I just want to have an understanding. &gt;&gt; Roughly about 80, I believe. I think we just take one pallet down and then we'll just film it and call it a day. &gt;&gt; Well, 240,000 divided by 3 is 80. &gt;&gt; There's 24 in a box. &gt;&gt; So, how many people will be here to like actually move the product? What's what's kind of the tenative plan for getting Cuz I mean, I do that math like, okay, 10 guys. I don't know what how many how many books a minute somebody can put out. Um, you would know that math better than me because last year we had 30 and they got [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hammered and I am five, this will be five times bigger than last year. Now this time we are distributing between three different warehouses across the US. That way we can get it to you guys faster. We have 300 plus support staff that are going to be here for the launch. We have installed uh really exceptional AI. It's just a lot. It's a lot because we have high standards. It really just comes down to that. It's a lot because we want it to be exceptional for everyone at any touch point, any surface area that you're exposed to at the brand. All right, so we're opening this bad boy up. Somebody's gonna get a a lucky uh a lucky copy. Our goal is to get 1,800 more of these pallets of books, and we're going to try and do it in 24 hours, which is absolutely absurd. So, like, we're we're here, and we haven't started promoting it yet. &gt;&gt; At all. &gt;&gt; From that's an email. One email. It's one of those things that we can definitely box up if needed. So, &gt;&gt; no, I appreciate it. Thank you so much, Stephen. So, we just got out of the warehouse. Um, just double checking on numbers for pallets and books and what's going to get pre-kitted and making sure that they're staffed up so that they can uh handle the volume. Obviously, this is not all the locations. This is one of many. So, we'll have a meeting tomorrow and centralize with leadership and make sure that uh it's fully staffed so that we can uh accommodate it. But, there's always the unknown. So, &gt;&gt; thank you guys for all coming. &gt;&gt; I appreciate it. &gt;&gt; I'm Alex Shamoszi. That's where it starts. So, it's like I'm Alexi. This is my 100 million book launch. And then we like rock and roll, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Those ads are actually already done. Um, we finished the 40 or so that we filmed. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take the best hooks that are still that will still work. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The last couple. &gt;&gt; Great. So, last launch there was no um there was no offer to liquidate ad spend. Uh and so I just printed the money for the advertising. Um this one I'm demonstrating the concept of the book which is a money model. So basically how do you pull cash forward accelerate cash conversion uh within a business so that you can scale and so I want to demonstrate that with the launch. So that's what I'm doing. And so basically the goal is to spend as much money as humanly possible uh while maintaining break even or better. And the end result should be more good people knowing about it. So, this one should be bigger than the last one. We'll find out as long as ad accounts and, you know, all that stuff works the way, you know, we hope. If you're struggling to get as many customers as you want or it's costing you too much to get customers, rather than thinking, "Oh, I'm spending too much to get customers, do what you can control, make more from each one." And so, if you want the free event and the secret project, you only have to do one thing. Click the link, register. I'll see you there. &gt;&gt; Cool. Cut. &gt;&gt; I feel like that one's going to do what? Yeah, that crispy. &gt;&gt; I think it's possible to put a book in the hand of every entrepreneur in America. Books and experiences are the two things that really changed my life. The goal is to just have a really awesome experience for everyone in Mos Nation to come together and do entrepreneur things and do it for the greater good. Businesses rarely die of starvation. They often die of indigestion. Fundamentally, you need another way to attract customers. Your business isn't growing because you don't have a good enough money model. When was the last time you ever heard of a money model? Well, you probably haven't because no one's talking about it. &gt;&gt; So, we can say we got another green dude throwing a party. I like this, too. &gt;&gt; He's going to pop off. &gt;&gt; Come to the book launch August 16th. &gt;&gt; August 16th. &gt;&gt; Well, hope to see you there. No, you bet. See, this is why we advertise. No one knows. We think We think we're so important. No one knows. And if you're watching right now and you didn't know, now you know. August 16th, the book comes out. It's going to be sick. Five mystery headliners, four amazing free bonuses if you just pre-order, and I've got one secret project I've been working on for multiple years, and you'll get it for free just by registering. I'll see you there.
